"the search for the surface gravity effect of the free translational oscillations of the inner core , the so - called slichter modes @xcite , has been a subject of observational challenge , particularly since the development of worldwide data from superconducting gravimeters ( sgs ) of the global geodynamics project @xcite . indeed these relative gravimeters are the most suitable instruments to detect the small signals that would be expected from the slichter modes @xcite .    a first claim by @xcite of a triplet of frequencies that he attributed to the slichter modes led to a controversy ( e.g. @xcite ) . this detection has been supported by @xcite and @xcite but has not been confirmed by other authors @xcite . @xcite have shown it is necessary to consider dynamic love numbers to calculate the slichter mode eigenperiods . latest theoretical computation predicts a degenerate ( without rotation or ellipticity ) eigenperiod of 5.42 h @xcite for the seismological reference prem @xcite earth model . a more recent study by @xcite states that the period could be shorter because of the kinetics of phase transformations at the inner - core boundary ( icb ) . the interest raised by the slichter modes resides in its opportunity to constrain the density jump and the viscosity in the fluid outer core at the icb . the density jump at the icb is a parameter that constrains the kinetic energy required to power the geodynamo by compositional convection . some discrepancies have been obtained for the value of this parameter . on the one hand , by analyzing seismic pkikp / pcp phases , @xcite found that it should be smaller than 450 kg / m@xmath0 , later increased to 520 kg / m@xmath0 @xcite . on the other hand , using normal modes observation , @xcite obtained 820 @xmath1 180 kg / m@xmath0 . such differences in the estimate of the icb density jump have been partially attributed to the uncertainties associated with the seismic noise @xcite . a model that satisfies both the constraints set by powering the geodynamo with a reasonable heat flux from the core , and pkp traveltimes and normal mode frequencies has been proposed by @xcite with a large overall density jump between the inner and outer cores of 800 kg / m@xmath0 and a sharp density jump of 600 kg / m@xmath0 at the icb itself . in the following we will adopt the prem value of 600 kg / m@xmath0 . the non - detection of the slichter modes raises the question of their expected amplitude , their damping and the possible mechanisms to excite them . a certain number of papers have considered the damping of the inner core oscillation through anelasticity of the inner core and mantle @xcite , through viscous dissipation in the outer core @xcite or through magnetic dissipation @xcite . @xcite and @xcite have summarized the theoretical q values expected for the slichter mode . @xcite have concluded that it should most probably be equal to or larger than 2000 . various sources of excitation have been previously considered . the seismic excitation has been studied by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . they have shown that earthquakes can not excite the slichter modes to a level sufficient for the sgs to detect the induced surface gravity effect . for instance , even for the 1960 @xmath2 chilean event the induced surface gravity effect does not reach the nanogal level ( 1 ngal@xmath3 nm / s@xmath4 ) . surficial pressure flow acting at the icb and generated within the fluid outer core has been considered by @xcite and @xcite as a possible excitation mechanism . however , the flow in the core at a timescale of a few hours is too poorly constrained to provide reliable predictions of the amplitude of the slichter modes . @xcite have investigated the excitation of the slichter modes by the impact of a meteoroid , which they treated as a surficial seismic source . for the biggest known past collision associated to the chicxulub crater in mexico with a corresponding moment - magnitude @xmath2 , the surface excitation amplitude of the slichter mode was barely 0.0067 nm / s@xmath4 @xmath5 0.67 ngal . nowadays , a similar collision would therefore not excite the slichter modes to a detectable level . the degree - one surface load has also been investigated by @xcite . they showed that a gaussian - type zonal degree - one pressure flow of 4.5 hpa applied during 1.5 hour would excite the slichter mode and induce a surface gravity perturbation of 2 ngal which should be detectable by sgs @xcite . this determination was based on a purely analytical model of surface pressure .    in this paper we will use hourly surface pressure data provided by two different meteorological centers and show that the surface atmospheric pressure fluctuations can only excite the slichter modes to an amplitude below the limit of detection of current sgs . 1.5pt in this section , we consider a spherical earth model , for which the frequencies of the three slichter modes degenerate into a single frequency , and establish a formula for the spectral energy of the amplitude of the mode when it is excited by a surface load . developed in a surface spherical harmonics expansion , a degree - one load @xmath6 contains three terms : @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the colatitude and longitude , respectively . the green function formalism suited for surface - load problems @xcite has been generalized to the visco - elastic case by @xcite and has been established for the degree - one slichter mode by @xcite .    the degree - one radial displacement due to load ( [ load ] ) is given by @xmath10 \nonumber \\   & & \lbrack \int_{-\infty}^{t}e^{i\nu t ' } ( \sigma_{10}(t ' ) \cos\theta + \sigma_{11}^c(t ' ) \sin\theta \cos\phi    + { \sigma}_{11}^s(t ' ) \sin\theta \sin\phi ) dt ' \rbrack ,   \label{radialdisplacement(t)}\end{aligned}\ ] ] and the perturbation of the surface gravity is @xmath11 \nonumber \\    & & \lbrack \int_{-\infty}^{t}e^{i\nu t ' } ( \sigma_{10}(t ' ) \cos\theta + \sigma_{11}^c(t ' ) \sin\theta \cos\phi    + { \sigma}_{11}^s(t ' ) \sin\theta \sin\phi ) dt ' \rbrack   \nonumber \\    & & [ -\omega^2u(r_s)+\frac{2}{r_s}g_0 u(r_s)+\frac{2}{r_s}p(r_s)].\end{aligned}\ ] ] in the last two equations , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are , respectively , the radial displacement and perturbation of the gravity potential associated to the slichter mode , @xmath14 is the earth radius , and @xmath15 is the complex frequency . as in @xcite , we adopt a quality factor @xmath16 and a period @xmath17 h for a prem - like earth s model . the sources of excitation we consider are continuous pressure variations at the surface . a similar problem was treated by @xcite and @xcite for the atmospheric excitation of normal modes where the sources were considered as stochastic quantities in space and time . as we use a harmonic spherical decomposition of the pressure field , the correlation in space depends on the harmonic degree , here the degree - one component of wavelength @xmath18 . the correlation in time is performed in the spectral domain .    as a consequence we introduce the energy spectrum of the degree - one pressure fluctuations @xmath19 and the energy spectrum of the radial displacement @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the fourier transform of @xmath22 , @xmath23 is the fourier transform of @xmath24 and @xmath25 denotes the complex conjugate . the fourier transform of eq . ( [ radialdisplacement(t ) ] ) is @xmath26   \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty } e^{-i\omega t } \lbrack \int_{-\infty}^{t}e^{i\nu_kt ' } \nonumber \\ & & ( \sigma_{10}(t ' ) \cos\theta + \sigma_{11}^c(t ' ) \sin\theta \cos\phi    + { \sigma}_{11}^s(t ' ) \sin\theta \sin\phi ) dt ' \rbrack dt \nonumber \\ & = & \frac{r_s^2 u(r)}{\omega_0(1+\frac{1}{4q^2 } ) } [ u(r_s)g_0+p(r_s ) ]    \frac{\omega_0(1-\frac{1}{4q^2})-\omega+\frac{i}{2q}(\omega-2\omega_0)}{\frac{\omega_0 ^ 2}{4q^2}+(\omega_0-\omega)^2 } \nonumber \\   & & ( { \hat \sigma_{10}}(\omega)\cos\theta + { \hat \sigma_{11}^c}(\omega)\sin\theta \cos\phi + { \hat \sigma_{11}^s}(\omega)\sin\theta \sin\phi ) , \nonumber\end{aligned}\ ] ] and , therefore , we have @xmath27 ^ 2 \nonumber \\   & & \frac{\lbrack \omega_0(1-\frac{1}{4q^2})-\omega \rbrack^2+\frac{(\omega-2\omega_0)^2}{4q^2 } }   { \lbrack \frac{\omega_0 ^ 2}{4q^2}+(\omega_0-\omega)^2\rbrack ^2 } s_p(\theta,\phi;\omega ) . \end{aligned}\ ] ] from eq.([exdispl ] ) and ( [ deltag ] ) , we obtain the spectral energy of gravity @xmath28 for the excitation of the slichter mode by a surface fluid layer @xmath29 ^ 2 \nonumber \\   & & \frac{\lbrack \omega_0(1-\frac{1}{4q^2})-\omega \rbrack^2+\frac{(\omega-2\omega_0)^2}{4q^2 } }   { \lbrack \frac{\omega_0 ^ 2}{4q^2}+(\omega_0-\omega)^2\rbrack ^2 } s_p(\theta,\phi;\omega).\end{aligned}\ ] ] the operational model of the european centre for medium - range weather forecasts ( ecmwf ) is usually available at 3-hourly temporal resolution , the spatial resolution varying from about 35 km in 2002 to 12 km since 2009 . this is clearly not sufficient to investigate the slichter mode excitation . however , during the period of cont08 measurements campaign ( august @xmath30 , 2008 ) , atmospheric analysis data were provided by the ecmwf also on an hourly basis . cont08 provided 2 weeks of continuous very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) observations for the study , among other goals , of daily and sub - daily variations in earth rotation @xcite . we take advantage of this higher - than - usual temporal resolution to compute the excitation of the slichter mode by the surface pressure fluctuations . to do so , we first extract the degree - one coefficients of the surface pressure during this period , considering both an inverted and a non - inverted barometer response of the oceans to air pressure variations @xcite . both hypotheses have the advantage to give simple responses of the oceans to atmospheric forcing , even if at such high frequencies , static responses are known to be inadequate . the use of a dynamic response of the ocean @xcite would lead to more accurate results but we would need a forcing ( pressure and winds ) of the oceans at hourly time scales which is not available . the degree-1 surface pressure changes contain three terms : @xmath31 from it , we can estimate the surface mass density by @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the mean surface gravity and compute the energy spectrum @xmath34 as defined in eq.([sp ] ) . the time - variations and fourier amplitude spectra of the harmonic degree - one coefficients @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are plotted in fig.[fig : time_fft_ib ] for the ib and non - ib hypotheses . the power spectral densities ( psds ) computed over the whole period considered here ( august 2008 ) are represented in fig.[fig : mapspsd ] for both oceanic responses . we also consider the ncep ( national centers for environmental prediction ) climate forecast system reanalysis ( cfsr ) model @xcite , for which hourly surface pressure is available with a spatial resolution of about 0.3@xmath38 before 2010 , and 0.2@xmath38 after . ncep / cfsr and ecmwf models used different assimilation schemes , e.g. 4d variational analysis for ecmwf , and a 3d variational analysis for ncep / cfsr every 6  hours . the temporal continuity of pressure is therefore enforced in the ecmwf model , whereas 6-hourly assimilation steps can sometimes be seen in the ncep / cfsr pressure series , for certain areas and time . the power spectral densities of the degree - one ncep / cfsr surface pressure field computed over august 2008 are represented in fig . [ fig : mapspsdncep ] for both oceanic responses . using equations ( [ deltag ] ) and ( [ exg ] ) we can compute the surface gravity perturbation induced by the slichter mode excited by the degree - one ecmwf and ncep / cfsr surface atmospheric pressure variations during august 2008 . the computation is performed with the eigenfunctions obtained for a spherical , self - gravitating anelastic prem - like earth model as in @xcite . we remove the 3 km - thick global ocean from the prem model because the ocean response is already included in the degree - one atmospheric coefficients . the power spectral densities of the surface gravity effect induced by the slichter mode excited by the ecmwf atmospheric data are plotted in figs [ fig : dgib - nib_maps_ecmwf ] for an inverted and a non - inverted barometer response of the oceans . the psd is given in decibels to enable an easy comparison with previous sg noise level studies ( e.g. @xcite ) . ncep / cfsr weather solutions give a similar surface excitation amplitude less than -175 db . we also consider the psds of the excitation amplitude at the sg sites djougou ( benin ) and bfo ( black forest observatory , germany ) for both oceanic responses in fig . [ fig : dg_ecmwf_b1dj_ngal ] . according to fig . [ fig : dgib - nib_maps_ecmwf ] the djougou site turns out to be located at a maximum of excitation amplitude in the case of an inverted barometer response of the oceans . bfo is the sg site with the lowest noise level at sub - seismic frequencies @xcite . the later noise level is also plotted in fig . [ fig : dg_ecmwf_b1dj_ngal ] . in that figure , we can see that the excitation amplitude at djougou reaches -175 db . for an undamped harmonic signal of amplitude @xmath39 the psd is defined by @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the number of samples and @xmath42 the sampling interval . consequently , assuming a 15-day time duration with a sampling rate of 1 min , a psd amplitude of -175 db corresponds to a harmonic signal of 0.3 ngal , which is clearly below the 1 ngal detection threshold and below the best sg noise level . a decrease of noise by a factor 3 would be necessary to be able to detect such a sub - nanogal effect . stacking @xmath43 worldwide sgs of low noise levels would improve the signal - to - noise ratio by a factor @xmath44 . supposing that we had a large number of sg sites with equal noise levels ( same as bfo sg noise level ) , then we would need to stack 10 datasets to improve the snr by 10 db , so as to reach the nanogal level . both ecmwf and ncep atmospheric pressure data lead to a similar , presently undetectable , excitation amplitude for the slichter mode during august 2008 . however , as we have at our disposal 11 years of hourly ncep / cfsr surface pressure field , we can look at the time - variations of the excitation amplitude of the slichter mode over the full period . ncep atmospheric pressure data are assimilated every 6 h introducing an artificial periodic signal . in order to avoid the contamination by this 6 h - oscillation in spectral domain on the slichter mode period of 5.42 h , we need a data length of 2.5 days at least . we consider time - windows of 15 days shifted by 7 days and compute the surface excitation amplitude of the slichter mode at the bfo and djougou superconducting gravimeter sites and at location on earth for which the excitation amplitude is maximum ( fig.[fig : dg_bfo - dj_ncep_11yr ] ) . note that this location of maximum amplitude is also varying in time . we can see that the excitation amplitude is larger than 0.4 ngal at bfo for instance between january and march 2004 and in november 2005 for both oceanic responses . there is also a peak of excitation at djougou in november 2005 and between january and march 2004 but only for an ib - hypothesis . however , during these 11 years between 2000 and 2011 , the maximum surface excitation amplitude stays below 0.7 ngal .    as a consequence we can conclude that the degree - one surface pressure variations are a possible source of excitation for the slichter mode but the induced surface gravity effect is too weak to be detected by current sgs . using a normal mode formalism , we have computed the surface gravity perturbations induced by a continuous excitation of the slichter mode by atmospheric degree - one pressure variations provided by two meteorological centers : ecmwf and ncep / cfsr . both inverted and non - inverted barometer responses of the oceans to the atmospheric load have been employed . we have shown that the induced surface gravity signal does not reach the nanogal level , which is considered as being the level of detection of present sgs . the surficial degree - one pressure variations are a probable source of excitation of the slichter mode but the weak induced surface amplitude is one additional reason why this translational mode core has never been detected . an instrumental challenge for the future gravimeters would be to further decrease their noise levels . another source of possible excitation that has not been investigated yet is the dynamic response of the oceans . the oceans are known to be a source of continuous excitation of the fundamental seismic modes @xcite . so a further study would require to improve the response of the oceans . we would like to thank two anonymous reviewers for their comments on this work . we acknowledge the use of meteorological data of the ecmwf and ncep .          courtier , n. , ducarme , b. , goodkind , j. , hinderer , j. , imanishi , y. , seama , n. , sun , h. , merriam , j. , bengert , b. , smylie , d.e . global superconducting gravimeter observations and the search for the translational modes of the inner core , _ phys . earth planet . _ , _ 117 _ , 320 . pagiatakis , s. d. , yin , h. and abd el - gelil , m.

The search for the surface gravity effect of the free translational oscillations of the inner core, known as the ""slicer"" mode, has been a challenging task since the development of worldwide data from superconducting gravimeters (SGS) of the Global Geodynamics Project (GDP). The first claim by the GDP attributed to the slicer mode led to a controversy, and subsequent studies have shown that it is necessary to consider dynamic Love numbers to calculate the","using hourly atmospheric surface pressure field from ecmwf ( european centre for medium - range weather forecasts ) and from ncep ( national centers for environmental prediction ) climate forecast system reanalysis ( cfsr ) models , we show that atmospheric pressure fluctuations excite the translational oscillation of the inner core , the so - called slichter mode , to the sub - nanogal level at the earth surface . 
 the computation is performed using a normal - mode formalism for a spherical , self - gravitating anelastic prem - like earth model . 
 we determine the statistical response in the form of power spectral densities of the degree - one spherical harmonic components of the observed pressure field . 
 both hypotheses of inverted and non - inverted barometer for the ocean response to pressure forcing are considered . 
 based on previously computed noise levels , we show that the surface excitation amplitude is below the limit of detection of the superconducting gravimeters , making the slichter mode detection a challenging instrumental task for the near future .

"mira ( o ceti ) is the prototype of the class of mira - type variable stars , characterized observationally by large visual photometric pulsation amplitudes and regular periods between 100 and 1000 days . mira - type variables represent one of the late stages of evolution for 1 - 2 solar mass stars , with luminosities of several thousand times solar and mass loss rates of order @xmath2 solar masses per year . the winds from mira - type variables are relatively slow ( typically @xmath310 kms@xmath4 ) , which means that the mass lost in these winds can be readily accreted onto any stellar companions . it is known that 57% of the progenitors of mira - type variables , g and f dwarfs , have a companion with a mass more than a tenth of the primary mass @xcite . however , most of the companions around mira - type primaries remain undetected because of the overwhelming flux of the mira - type primary and the difficulty in making precise radial velocity measurements due to the stellar pulsation . the most reliable ways to detect companions are through the signs of wind accretion : either a short - wavelength ( e.g. ultraviolet ) excess or rapid photometric variability @xcite . mira  b was first discovered visually in 1923 , when it was at a separation of 0.9  @xcite , and has since been imaged in x - rays , ultraviolet and the radio @xcite . observations of the mira  ab system with the infrared spatial interferometer also offered a tentative detection of flux from near the position of mira  b at 11.17@xmath1 m , interpreted as a clump of dust @xcite . previous attempts at deconvolution of mid - infrared images @xcite showed a coma - like elongation in the direction of mira  b and a feature at @xmath0twice the mira  ab separation , but quantitative interpretation of these data was difficult due to the difficulties in de - convolving seeing - limited images . the nature of mira  b has been and remains controversial , due to the radiation originating from mira  b being dominated by accretion . according to the arguments originally made by @xcite and reinforced by @xcite , mira b must be a low - mass main sequence star , as the x - ray and total luminosity of mira  b is far too weak for the companion to be a white dwarf . this argument relies on measurements of the mira  b wind , reasonable values for the true ( i.e. non projected ) separation of mira  ab and the bondi - hoyle accretion rate being correct within a factor of 10 . this paper presents novel non - redundant interferometry observations of mira  ab , enabling robust detection of mid - infrared flux from the vicinity of mira  b. these and other traditional imaging observations are presented in detail in section  [ sectobservations ] . an examination of possible models for this emission is presented in section  [ sectmodelling ] and the implications of the preferred ( disk ) model presented in section  [ sectdiscussion ] . in the mid - infrared , observations on a 10 m class of telescope can be nearly diffraction limited in good seeing conditions . with a 15 cm atmospheric coherence length at 550 nm , a 10 m aperture is two coherence lengths wide at 10@xmath1 m . in this regime , the image of a point source usually has a single bright core , but deconvolution is difficult due to changes in seeing and changes in low order aberrations with changing elevations . we first overcame these difficulties by individually re - pointing and re - phasing 4 sets of 6 segments out of the 36 separate segments that made up the primary mirror of the keck i telescope . as part of an observing program designed to resolve the dusty winds from mira variables , these `` segment tilting '' observations of @xmath5  ceti were made at 8 , 9.9 , 10.7 and 12.5@xmath1 m . these four sets of segments formed 4 interferograms on the long - wavelength spectrometer ( lws ) camera , each of which gave 15 visibility amplitude and 20 closure phase ( 10 independent ) measurements on the source . this technique is described in @xcite and @xcite . at 10.7@xmath1 m , data was also taken in a configuration with 3 sets of 7 segments with non - redundant spacings . calibration observations were made of @xmath6  cet and @xmath6  tau to calibrate visibility amplitude and subtract out any instrumental closure - phase . the macim algorithm : a monte - carlo technique for imaging from closure - phase and squared visibility @xcite was used to create images at all wavelengths . as part of this imaging process , we incorporated prior knowledge that a set fraction of the flux comes from a compact central source ( i.e. the central star mira  a ) with a 50mas diameter . this size comes from the longer - baseline observations of @xcite . we estimated the fraction of light from this 50mas source by assuming simple black - body emission , based on the source containing 75% of the 8@xmath1 m flux . this step had little effect on flux near the location of mira  b , but affected the deconvolution of the central source and dust shell , due to the documented tendency for techniques in the maximum - entropy family to spread flux over the image at the expense of the compact central source . unambiguous detections of flux near the location of mira  b were made at 12.5 and 10.7 microns , with a lower signal - to - noise detection at 9.9 microns . the 10.7 and 12.5 micron images are shown in figure  [ figkeckims ] . the separation and position angle of mira  b with respect to mira  a was obtained for the 10.7 and 12.5@xmath1 m data by searching for a peak in the difference image between the reconstructed image and the azimuthally - averaged reconstructed image with mira  b masked - out . flux measurements of mira  b were obtained from aperture - photometry on this differenced image . we also attempted to simultaneously reconstruct a dust shell image and perform a binary fit to the fourier data using macim , obtaining consistent results and an independent estimation of errors on the binary parameters directly from macim s markov chain . the average separation and position angle from these fits is @xmath7and @xmath8 degrees . we independently calibrated the camera plate scale and orientation by observing binaries xy per and @xmath6  her , giving results in agreement with previous calibrations @xcite . plate scale uncertainties are included in the above error estimates .    to obtain comparable astrometry for the ultraviolet position of mira  b , we extrapolate based on a linear fit between @xcite and the 2004 february hst stis o8wy02040 data sets . projected to jd2453248 , we find a separation of @xmath9  at @xmath10 degrees . in comparing the ultraviolet and mid - infrared detections , the position angles are found to be consistent . however , the difference in separation is significant , so the thermal ir and uv emission from mira  b must arise from different physical regions .    to confirm this result , we obtained additional data using an aperture - mask in the t - recs camera on gemini south ( program i d gs-2006b - q-15 ) . the mask is installed in the cold lyot stop wheel of t - recs , decreasing the background significantly from the keck experiment , where the full telescope pupil contributed to the background in all interferograms . this mask has 7 holes in a non - redundant configuration , amounting to 21 simultaneous visibility amplitudes and 35 closure - phases ( 15 independent ) . baseline lengths projected on the primary mirror range from 1.78 to 6.43 m , and sky rotation is used to increase the fourier coverage while maintaining the same relationship between positions on the mask and positions on the primary mirror . the masking observations of mira  ab used @xmath11  eri , @xmath6  ceti and @xmath6  tau as interferometric calibrators . these data were obtained in november 2006 at 7.7@xmath1 m , 9.7@xmath1 m , 12.3@xmath1 m and 18.3@xmath1 m . due to a greater instrumental stability , these data were of better quality than the keck data , although the resolution was slightly less and as mira  a was near minimum , the contrast between mira  a and the dust shell was lower . images reconstructed using macim are shown in figure  [ figgeminiims ] - again showing a clear feature in the vicinity of mira  b in three out of four filters . astrometry and flux estimates were obtained in a similar way to the keck data , with fits summarized in table  [ tabbinaryfits ] . flux ratios and astrometry were consistent between the keck and gemini data . in addition to these mid - infrared aperture - masking observations , we analyzed earlier keck / lws observations of @xmath5  ceti from september 1999 and august 2002 made without the use of a mask or segment - tilting . rotating the images 180 degrees and subtracting enabled most of the primary psf to be removed . again , a bright feature in the vicinity of mira  b was detected at a high level of confidence . the contrast ratios obtained from these data were 0.102@xmath120.022 in september 1999 ( jd 2451423.6 ) and @xmath13 in august 2002 ( jd 2452506.6 ) . the errors were estimated by applying the same analysis method to 6 calibrator star observations . other observations at wavelengths between 0.97 microns ( hst , nicmos data set n4rk02otq ) 3.08 microns ( aperture - masking ) and 4.67 microns ( direct imaging ) did not detect the companion , but were able to place 2-@xmath14 upper limits on the contrast ratio of 500:1 , 700:1 and 700:1 respectively . all observations reported in this paper as well as previously published hst observations , are summarized in table  1 , with the spectral - energy distribution shown in figure  [ figsed ] . in addition to these observations , the paper of @xcite provided model - fits to infrared spatial interferometer ( isi ) observations with a dust ` clump ' near the location of mira  b. they reported the separation and position angle of this clump to be 0.55@xmath15 and 120 degrees , but with no estimate of uncertainty due to the limited uv coverage of the array . the flux ratios of the clump were not given , although the dust has an optical -

dependent astrometry and the total flux ( i.e. the energetics ) of the emission . we will now examine several hypotheses in turn . if the radiation near mira  b were re - processed radiation from mira  a , then the flux would change with the mira variability cycle . there is a decrease in flux at the most temperature - sensitive wavelength of 10@xmath1 m for the feature near mira  b occurring over the interval between the keck ( lws ) and gemini ( t - recs ) observations . this decrease co - incides with a decrease in the flux from mira  a due to the mira variability cycle ( see table  [ tabbinaryfits ] ) , consistent with the re - processsed radiation hypothesis . this is further supported by the modeling of @xcite , where a constant amount of dust was used to model observations at several epochs . one possible origin is therefore re - radiated flux from an unusually dense clump in the wind from mira  a.    the likelihood of a clump of dust in the wind causing the mid - infrared emission is not great , as an optical - depth of order unity is required to produce enough emission . in turn , this requires a wind over - density of at least 25 ( based on full silicate condensation at solar metallicity ) .    we can be slightly more sophisticated and model this dust clump as a uniform slab , assuming that the dust is made from a combination of fully - condensed corundum and olivine at solar metallicity . we take the optical constants for olivine from @xcite and those of corundum from @xcite and calculate dust opacities as in @xcite . from three - color photometry , we can derive a column density , a temperature and an angular extent as the radius of an equivalent uniformly - illuminated disk . for the near - maximum lws data , we obtain 0.28g@xmath17 , 310k and a disk radius of 59mas , and for the near - minimum t - recs data we obtain 0.2g@xmath17 , 240k and 96mas . these temperatures are also consistent with the assumption of heating of the dust by mira  a for moderate ( roughly 45 degree ) angles between the clump to the line - of - sight . these column densities can be compared to those of a 100au deep column in the time - averaged wind at the @xmath050au projected separation , which totals only 0.007g@xmath17 . these calculations are somewhat dependent on the assumed and unknown dust opacities , but they serve to provide plausible physical model parameters for the emission . the large required column densities are due to the emission in the 12@xmath1 m bandpasses being brighter than expected from optically - thin emission in the 10 and 18@xmath1 m bands . alternatively , one can think of the emission at 10 and 18@xmath1 m as being suppressed due to the dust being optically - thick . the modeling of the fourier data in @xcite put a dust ` clump ' near the location of mira  b between 1990 and 1994 . the position angle of 120 degrees and separation of 0.55@xmath15 places this emission inside the early-1990s position of mira  b but outside the position of the dust clump reported in this paper . therefore , not only is this clump of dust inexplicably over - dense , but its apparent motion is in the opposite direction to the outflow from mira  a , which should move outwards at 14mas per year according to the outflow measurements of @xcite with an assumed distance of 107pc . this would mean that if the dust ` clump ' seen by keck and gemini moved with the mira  a outflow , it would have been at @xmath18 during the @xcite epoch . despite the simple modeling in that paper , it is not plausible that the clump separation was overestimated by a factor of 1.8 , or that in addition to the 0.55@xmath15 clump , a ( brighter ) @xmath00.31@xmath15 clump was missed in the analysis .    therefore , due to both the anomalously high optical depth of dust near mira b and the motion of the emission counter to to the prevailing wind from mira  a , we conclude that the mid - infrared emission is inconsistent with a clump in the wind from mira  a.      although the variability of the mid - infrared flux near mira  b is consistent with re - processed radiation from mira  b , the phase coverage and signal - to - noise of the data in table  [ tabbinaryfits ] is clearly inadequate to exclude processes independent of mira  a s radiation field . therefore , we will check if the energy involved in the wind interaction region is enough to explain the mid - infrared emission . @xcite model the early 2004 outflow from mira  b as a 450kms@xmath4 wind losing @xmath19yr@xmath4 . this wind is variable , with evidence that it was weaker in the late 1990s and stronger in the iue era @xcite . as this wind encounters the more dense wind from mira  a , it will lose it s energy in a shock front . this shock luminosity ( @xmath20 ) will be @xmath21 , which is a tiny fraction of the mid - infrared luminosity coming from near mira  b , which is @xmath22 . thus , if the mid - infrared emission were to originate from the wind - interaction region , it would have to be due to a quasi - static increase in the density of mira  a s wind due to the wind from mira  b. according to the model of section  [ sectclump ] , this region has to have at least @xmath23 solar - masses of material , over a length scale of @xmath24au . 20au is roughly the maximum distance over which the flux would still be largely unresolved in our images , once projection effects are taken into account .    the simplest geometry in which to consider the outflow from mira  b is one where the wind from mira  b is largely perpendicular to the wind from mira  a. in this geometry , the mass excess due to the slowing of mira  a s wind by mira  b s wind is of order @xmath25 over length scales @xmath26 , which is @xmath27 , or 6 orders of magnitude too little material . the outflow from mira  b may be nearly spherically - symmetric , including a component as just described , as well as a region where the two winds collide nearly head - on , possibly forming a stagnation point . calculation of the stagnation point position is a simple balance of dynamic ( ram ) pressures @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the wind density and @xmath30 the wind speed ( for either mira  a or mira  b ) . this stagnation point is significantly influenced by the gravitational field from mira  b : both by an change in density @xmath29 of mira  a s wind and an increase in velocity . we have taken these effects into account using newtonian physics , and calculated the stagnation point position . with mira  b wind parameters of @xmath31@xmath32 at 450kms@xmath4 , mira  a wind parameters of @xmath33@xmath32 at 6.7kms@xmath4 @xcite a mira  ab distance of 90au and a mira  b mass of 0.7m@xmath34 ( see section  [ sectdisk ] ) , this stagnation point occurs only 1au from mira  b ( projection effects not taken into account ) . an upper limit for this distance is the 3.7au calculated in @xcite for the stronger iue era wind , with different assumed wind and orbital parameters . therefore , a large build - up of dust at this stagnation point could not form a region geometrically large enough to provide the mid - infrared flux . t  tauri stars are well known to have significant mid - infrared excesses . as accretion onto mira b occurs through a disk , we can also ask if the emission is consistent with expectations from known and well - characterized accretion disks . by comparing the emission of the mira  b system to t  tauri stars ( i.e. systems with significant accretion luminosity ) as in figure [ figsed ] , it is clear that although the blue and ultraviolet accretion luminosity is typical , the very large mid - infrared flux from mira  b is anomalous by more than a factor of 50 . therefore , this emission must be due to a mechanism atypical of isolated systems with a disk and outflow . furthermore , the problem of the in - phase variation with the mira  a primary presents an additional stumbling block to this model . we will now examine a model of the mid - infrared emission near mira  b that is caused by illumination of an accretion disk around mira  b by radiation from mira  a. in this section we will not discuss the possibilities of this disk being around a white dwarf or a main sequence star . this disk will be supposed to be in the plane of the mira  ab orbit , so that one edge is illuminated and the opposite edge is in shadow . this co - planar geometry is expected if angular momentum is preferentially accreted in the plane of the orbit . it is illustrated in figure  [ figquickdiagram ] . first , we shall review the theory of wind accretion as it applies to mira  ab . the accretion of the wind from mira  a onto mira  b is given by the formulae of bondi - hoyle - lyttleton accretion ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . in its simplest form , the wind is gravitationally focused into a wake behind the accretor , and the wake is accreted wherever it is gravitationally bound to the accretor . this gives an accretion radius , which is the radius of a circular area that corresponds to the effective cross - section of the accretor :    @xmath35    here @xmath36 is the accretor ( i.e. mira  b ) mass , @xmath30 the wind velocity and @xmath37 the orbital velocity . this formula is most applicable to highly supersonic flows , which is the case for mira  b accreting the wind from mira  a. this accretion radius can be used to find an accretion rate :    @xmath38    the accretion luminosity is then given by the simple formula @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the radius of the companion . this formula assumes an equilibrium situation , which may not be the case if material is accumulating within the disk .    in order to test hypotheses that the accretion disk around mira  b has been directly observed , we should first examine some basic parameters of the system . the best estimate for @xmath41 is @xmath42 per year , with @xmath43kms@xmath4 @xcite . this mass - loss rate is based on a co to h@xmath44 ratio of @xmath45 which is in turn based on a near - solar metallicity . if mira  a has sub - solar metallicity as expected from its kinematic association with the thick - disk population , then this mass - loss rate will be underestimated . the orbit of mira  b is poorly known due to it s long period , but if we assume a circular orbit and fix the total system mass to 1.5@xmath46 , then the astrometry of @xcite combined with the most recent hst epoch ( in table  [ tabbinaryfits ] ) gives a crude orbital radius of @xmath47 au , an inclination is 63 degrees and a period of 610 years . changing the assumed total system mass to 2.0@xmath46 only changes the orbital radius to 85 au and the inclination to 66 degrees . for the total mass 1.5@xmath46 orbit , we have an orbital velocity @xmath48kms@xmath4 and an accretion radius in au of 32@xmath49 according to equation  [ eqnbhradius ] . the maximum size of the accretion disk around mira  b will be approximately the bondi - hoyle accretion radius , as beyond this radius the wind from mira  a will have enough energy to both escape from the gravity of mira  b and transfer some momentum onto material orbiting around mira  b. conversely , the minimum accretion radius is the size of the disk measured from the difference in astrometry between mira  b and the mid - infrared emission . in the plane of the sky , the mid - infrared emission is separated from mira  b by @xmath50au . the error in this astrometric difference is difficult to quantify in individual images , particularly given the possibility that asymmetries in the atmosphere of mira  a could move its centroid around by of order 1au . however , even if we do not count the @xcite result as a single measurement , then we have 6 independent measurements of the astrometric difference in table  [ tabbinaryfits ] that give the same sign and a similar magnitude . determination of the average separation between mira  b ( from the uv ) and the mid - infrared emission therefore appears statistically robust with reliable errors . the true separation of mira  b and the mid - infrared emisson is then @xmath51au , given that the vector between mira  a and b is at 38 degrees to the line - of - sight from our preferred orbit . this is consistent with a disk @xmath52 au in size once the effect of the curved geometry of the disk edge is taken into account . this disk size is is consistent with bondi - hoyle accretion theory , predicting an accretion radius range from 16 to 22au for @xmath36 between 0.5 and 0.7 @xmath53 . importantly , the disk size shows that the accretion radius can not be under - predicted using bondi - hoyle accretion theory by more than a factor of @xmath02 . we must also establish that the amount of mid - infrared emission seen from the edge of the disk around mira  b is consistent with the observed emission . already in section  [ sectclump ] we have seen that the emission is consistent with a region of cross - sectional area about 100 square au at temperature 310k ( from the slab model with a radius of 59mas ) . if mira  b is on the far side of mira  a as viewed from earth , we see the edge of the disk that is directly illuminated by mira  a.    if the disk edge has a temperature of 310k , then its hydrostatic equilibrium density distribution is gaussian with full - width half - maximum ( fwhm ) of 1.5au at a 10au radius . this disk of diameter 20au would only give a 100 square au cross - sectional area if the disk remained optically - thick to radiation from mira  a out to several times the density fwhm . however , given the significant uncertainties and simplifications in the slab model ( including the opacities themselves ) , this emission is certainly consistent with an origin in a side - illuminated accretion disk .    note also that the spectral energy distribution shown in figure  [ figsed ] is not consistent with the optical depth of unity temperature being the same throughout the mid - infrared : the sillicate emission peak and the upper limit at 7.9@xmath1 m ( from the near - minimum gemini epoch ) demonstrate that the outer surface of the disk has to be heated . this is an essential part of any physical model of the disk , where radiative energy flows inwards . given that we have established that mira  b has a @xmath010au radius dusty disk around it , we should establish whether the term ` protoplanetary ' can be applied to it . this term implies that there is or will be enough material in the disk to form planets . according to the prescription of @xcite , the minimum - mass solar nebula had 2 jupiter masses out to a radius of 10au . the total mass accreted onto mira  b during the lifetime of mira  a is of order 7 jupiter - masses , assuming that mira  b has 0.7 solar - masses and mira  a loses 0.6 solar masses while on the asymptotic giant branch . the ability for such a disk to form planets clearly depends on a number of factors , such as the role of viscosity in the disk and the maximum accretion rate that will occur as mira  a s wind transitions to a radiatively driven wind with a @xmath020 times increase in mass - loss rate .    according to the viscous evolution prescription of @xcite with their ` typical ' disk parameters , the current equilibrium disk mass around mira  b is only 0.26@xmath54 based on a @xmath550.7@xmath46 , an accretion rate given by equation  [ eqnbhacc ] and a disk radius of 10au . the time scale for viscous evolution of the disk is @xmath56 years . as the time scale for mira  a s evolution is based on the time between thermal pulses which is of order @xmath57 years @xcite , the disk will likely maintain a near - equilibrium mass . at the time mira a becomes a white dwarf , and the mass - loss rate from mira  a is @xmath58 solar - masses per year , the equilibium disk mass will have increased to several jupiter - masses , certainly enough to justify the title ` protoplanetary disk ' . now that we have established that mira  b has a @xmath59au accretion disk around it , we should re - examine the idea that mira  b is a main - sequence star and not a white dwarf as often identified in the literature . the mira  ab system is quite different to symbiotics such as mwc  560 , where the accretion luminosity is 1000 instead of 0.1@xmath60 . however , accretion luminosity should vary by several orders of magnitude for symbiotics due to differing accretion rates , and as mira  ab is unique in its relatively well - known geometry and wind properties , it is difficult to make quantitative comparisons . a second general property of symbiotics such as mwc  560 is that there are spectral features with wind absorption and emission profiles with widths that are one to several thousand kms@xmath4 @xcite , comparable to or greater than the escape velocity from the surface of a white dwarf . despite the large number of lines observed for mira  b ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , there are no lines with half - widths of several thousand kms@xmath4 as one would expect if mira  b were a white dwarf . the analysis of section  [ sectdisk ] demonstrated that the observed size of the accretion disk around mira  b is consistent with bondi - hoyle accretion , and that this accretion theory can not underestimate the accretion rate onto mira  b by more than a factor of a few . on the other hand if we assume that mira  b is a 0.6@xmath46 white dwarf , then the same analysis gives an accretion rate of @xmath61/yr and an accretion luminosity of 9.4l@xmath62 . this is inconsistent with the measured accretion luminosity of mira  b , which is @xmath63 , depending on what fraction of the flux is from accretion and what the extinction is . the value of @xmath64 is an upper limit based on all the measured luminosity at @xmath65 m being due to accretion and @xmath66 , the extinction calculated from full silicate condensation in mira  a s wind . there is a possibility that the accretion luminosity is lower than expected for mira  b due to a non - equilibrium situation where mass is accreted into a disk but not onto mira  b itself . the disk evolution time - scale discussed in section  [ sectdisk ] makes this a highly unlikely scenario . if on the other hand , we assume that mira  b is a 0.7@xmath46 main - sequence star , then the accretion luminosity is 0.2@xmath67 , completely consistent with the measured luminosity of mira  b. finally , if mira  b were a main - sequence star , we could expect to see spectral features that indicate the presence of a main - sequence star , although these features could be very weak . the weak features are due to significant veiling by the accretion flux : a good example of this is for t  tauri stars can be found in the spectrum of bp  tau , which is significantly veiled for all wavelengths shorter than 0.5@xmath1 m @xcite . the faint object camera ( foc ) spectra partially published in @xcite do indeed show weak ( i.e. veiled ) spectral features of an early - mid k dwarf . we have examined the full wavelength range of this spectrum ( including that not published ) , derived from hst data set x31g010at , and displayed the long - wavelength end of it in figure  [ figkdwarf ] . we took the wavelength scale calibration from chapter  8 of the foc manual , referencing the zero point to the mg ii doublet near 2800prominent in the mira  b spectrum . prominent spectral features at 4250and 5100are both detected at @xmath68 , matching a veiled model @xmath04000k dwarf spectrum well . the @xmath060% veiling in v - band places the photospheric spectrum of mira  b at an absolute v magnitude of @xmath69 , also consistent with a 0.7@xmath46 k5 dwarf ( with @xmath70 mag of extinction at v band ) . all remaining possibilities for the nature of mira  b that could influence our conclusions consist of some kind of exotic geometries . an example could be a triple system with a radial velocity signature less than @xmath71kms@xmath4 ( so that it is not betrayed by ultraviolet spectral shifts ) and a close - system separation less than @xmath72au . in the absence of any data to support such a possibility , we will eliminate these possibilities with an appeal to occam s razor . therefore , we conclude that mira  b is indeed a main - sequence star , with a most probable mass of roughly 0.7@xmath46 .      from the standpoint of population synthesis , we can examine how common we expect mira  b like systems to be . our current galactic location in - between spiral arms means that the column - integrated star formation rate is about a quarter of what it was when mira  a s progenitor was born @xcite . in order to accrete at least a jupiter mass via wind - accretion , a wind - accreting binary should have log(p ) between 4 and @xmath06.5 in days ( the upper limit for p is dependent on primary and secondary mass ) . according to @xcite , @xmath023% of solar - mass stars have companions with log(p ) in this range . these results , taken together , imply that the birth - rate of mira  b - like disks around companions to 1 - 2@xmath53 stars should be similar to the local birth - rate of 1 - 2@xmath53 stars themselves . this immediately raises the question : where are the disks that formed by wind - accretion ? most debris disks in the solar neighborhood are around stars likely belonging to young associations @xcite . however , these debris disks are also generally cool and large , while a wind - accretion disk will be truncated by the dynamical pressure of the wind at roughly the bondi - hoyle accretion radius . the disks around secondaries in wind - accretion binaries should grow viscously after the primary dwindles into a white - dwarf , but clearly this process must leave debris disks much less often than the large primordial disks around young stars . the expected abundance of disks around companions to young white dwarfs is a clearly testable hypothesis of the bondi - hoyle truncation model of wind - accretion disks presented here . however , in order to test it , a sample of very young white dwarfs in binaries would have to be chosen . there are some such systems discovered through uv excesses : @xcite discusses many of them and some of the difficulties in forming a near - complete sample . other systems are discovered through infrared excesses to white dwarfs : many of these have been imaged with hst @xcite . disk fraction around the main sequence companions should approach unity for appropriate separations and ages less than several times the disk viscous evolution time - scale , i.e. a few @xmath73 years . this paper has presented evidence that mira  b is a @xmath00.7@xmath46 main sequence star surrounded by a @xmath59au radius disk . the new observations on which this is based were made possible by the high - contrast imaging capability of non - redundant interferometry on single - aperture telescopes . mira  ab is unique amongst wind accretion binaries in its well known binary and wind parameters , but this class of system is predicted to be relatively common as the end product of roughly 1 in 5 star systems with a solar - type primary . systems like mira  ab should produce the clear observational signatures of an accretion disk around the secondary for at least a few @xmath73 years after the primary becomes a white dwarf . we gratefully acknowledge the support of charles townes , the assistance of marc kassis in making the keck observations , the assistance of adwin boogert in planning the gemini observations and helpful discussions with nuria calvet and klaus pontoppidan . m.i . would like to acknowledge michelson fellowship support from the michelson science center and the nasa navigator program . this research has made use of the simbad database , the ines principle center and the iraf point source catalog . j.d.m . acknowledges support from the grant nasa -

Mira (Mira) is a variable star in the constellation of Cetus, characterized by large visual photometric pulsations and regular periods between 100 and 1000 days. It is a member of the Mira-type variable star class, which represents one of the late stages of evolution for stars with masses between 1-2 solar masses.

**Key Characteristics:**

* Mira-type variables are characterized by large visual photometric pulsations and","the mira  ab system is a nearby ( @xmath0107pc ) example of a wind accreting binary star system . in this class of system 
 , the wind from a mass - losing red giant star ( mira  a ) is accreted onto a companion ( mira  b ) , as indicated by an accretion shock signature in spectra at ultraviolet and x - ray wavelengths . using novel imaging techniques , we report the detection of emission at mid - infrared wavelengths between 9.7 and 18.3@xmath1 m from the vicinity of mira  b but with a peak at a radial position about 10 au closer to the primary mira  a. we interpret the mid - infrared emission as the edge of an optically - thick accretion disk heated by mira  a. the discovery of this new class of accretion disk fed by m - giant mass loss implies a potential population of young planetary systems in white - dwarf binaries which has been little explored , despite being relatively common in the solar neighborhood .",36879,464,925,37.34 seconds,25.69 MB,0.25974025974025977,0.03493449781659389,0.15584415584415584,0.8035843968391418,medium
"there is a considerable theoretical and practical interest in the dynamics of systems of interacting particles in confined geometries @xcite . single - file diffusion ( sfd ) refers to a one - dimensional ( 1d ) process where the motion of particles in a narrow channel ( e.g. , _ quasi_-1d systems ) is limited such that particles are not able to cross each other . as a consequence , the system diffuses as a whole resulting in anomalous diffusion . the mechanism of sfd was first proposed by hodgkin and keynes @xcite in order to study the passage of molecules through narrow pores . since the order of the particles is conserved over time , this results in unusual dynamics of the system @xcite , different from what is predicted from diffusion governed by fick s law . the main characteristic of the sfd phenomena is that , in the long - time limit , the msd ( mean - square displacement , defined as @xmath3^{2 } \rangle_{\delta t}$ ] ) scales with time as @xmath4 this relation was first obtained analytically in the pioneering work of harris @xcite . recent advances in nanotechnology have stimulated a growing interest in sfd , in particular , in the study of transport in nanopores @xcite . ion channels of biological membranes and carbon nanotubes @xcite are examples of such nanopores . the macroscopic flux of particles through such nanopores is of great importance for many practical applications , e.g. , particle transport across membranes is a crucial intermediate step in almost all biological and chemical engineering processes . sfd was observed in experiments on diffusion of molecules in zeolite molecular sieves @xcite . zeolites with unconnected parallel channels may serve as a good realization of the theoretically investigated one - dimensional systems . sfd is also related to growth phenomena @xcite . the theoretical background of sfd was developed in early studies on transport phenomena in 1d channels @xcite . it is also interesting to learn how the size of the system will influence the diffusive properties of the system . sfd in finite size systems has been the focus of increasing attention since there are few exact theoretical results to date @xcite , which showed the existence of different regimes of diffusion . colloidal systems , complex plasmas and vortex matter in type - ii superconductors are examples of systems where sfd may occur . the use of colloidal particles is technically interesting since it allows real time and spatial direct observation of their position , which is a great advantage as compared to atoms or molecules , as shown recently in , e.g. , the experimental study of defect induced melting @xcite . one typically uses micro - meter size colloidal particles in narrow channels , as shown in @xcite . the paramagnetic colloidal spheres of 3.6 @xmath5 were confined in circular trenches fabricated by photolithography and their trajectories were followed over long periods of time . several other studies have focused on the diffusive properties of complex plasmas . a complex plasma consists of micrometer - sized ( `` dust '' ) particles immersed in a gaseous plasma background . dust particles typically acquire a negative charge of several thousand elementary charges , and thus they interact with each other through their strong electrostatic repulsion @xcite .    systems of particles moving in space of reduced dimensionality or submitted to an external confinement potential exhibit different behavior from their free - of - border counterparts @xcite . the combined effect of interaction between the particles and the confinement potential plays a crucial role in their physical and chemical properties @xcite . @xcite , it was found that sfd depends on the inter - particle interaction and can even be suppressed if the interaction is sufficiently strong , resulting in a slower subdiffusive behavior , where @xmath1 @xmath2 , with @xmath6 .    in this paper , we will investigate the effects of confinement potential on the diffusive properties of a q1d system of interacting particles . in the limiting case of very narrow ( wide ) channels , particle diffusion can be referred to sfd ( 2d regime ) characterized by a subdiffusive ( normal diffusive ) long - time regime where the mean - squared displacement ( msd ) @xmath1 @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) . recall that the msd of a tagged hard - sphere particle in a one dimensional infinite system is characterized by two limiting diffusion behaviors : for time scales shorter than a certain crossover time @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the diffusion coefficient and @xmath11 is the particle concentration , @xmath1 @xmath8 which is referred to as the normal diffusion regime @xcite . for times larger than @xmath12 , the system exhibits a subdiffusive behavior , with the msd @xmath1 @xmath7 , which characterizes the single - file diffusion regime . between these two regimes , there is a transient regime exhibiting a non - trivial functional form . however , in case of a _ finite _ system of diffusing particles ( e.g. , a circular chain or a straight chain in the presence of periodic boundary conditions ) , the sfd regime ( i.e. , with @xmath1 @xmath7 ) does not hold for @xmath13 , unlike in an infinite system . instead , for sufficiently long times , the sfd regime turns to the regime of _ collective _ diffusion , i.e. , when the whole system diffuses as a single `` particle '' with a renormalized mass . this diffusive behavior has been revealed in experiments @xcite and theoretical studies @xcite . this collective diffusion regime is similar to the initial short - time diffusion regime and it is characterized by either @xmath1 @xmath8 , for overdamped particles ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) or by @xmath1 @xmath14 ( followed by the msd @xmath8 ) , for underdamped systems @xcite . correspondingly , the time interval where the sfd regime is observed becomes _ finite _ in finite size systems . it depends on the lenght of the chain of diffusing particles : the longer the chain the longer the sfd time interval . therefore , in order to observe a clear power - law behavior ( i.e. , @xmath1 @xmath2 ) one should consider sufficiently large systems . here we focus on this intermediate diffusion regime and we show that it can be characterized by @xmath1 @xmath2 , where @xmath15 , depending on the width ( or the strenght of the confinement potential ) of the channel . we analyze the msd for two different channel geometries : ( i ) a linear channel , and ( ii ) a circular channel . these two systems correspond to different experimental realizations of diffusion of charged particles in narrow channels @xcite . the latter one ( i.e. , a circular channel ) has obvious advantages : ( i ) it allows a long - time observation of diffusion using a relatively short circuit , and ( ii ) it provides constant average particle density and absence of density gradients ( which occur in , e.g. , a linear channel due to the entry / exit of particles in / from the channel ) . thus circular narrow channels were used in diffusion experiments with colloids @xcite and metallic charged particles ( balls ) @xcite . furthermore , using different systems allows us to demonstrate that the results obtained in our study are generic and do not depend on the specific experimental set - up . this paper is organized as follows . in sec . ii , we introduce the model and numerical approach . in sec . iii diffusion in a system of interacting particles , confined to a straight hard - wall or parabolic channel , is studied as a function of the channel width or confinement strength . in sec . iv , we discuss the possibility of experimental observation of the studied crossover from the sfd to 2d diffusive regime . for that purpose , we analyze diffusion in a realistic experimental set - up , i.e. , diffusion of massive metallic balls embedded in a circular channel with parabolic confinement whose strength can be controlled by an applied electric field . the long - time limit is analyzed in sec . v using a discrete site model . finally , the conclusions are presented in sec . our model system consists of @xmath16 identical charged particles interacting through a repulsive pair potential @xmath17 . in this study , we use a screened coulomb potential ( yukawa potential ) , @xmath18 . in the transverse direction , the motion of the particles is restricted either by a hard - wall or by a parabolic confinement potential . thus the total potential energy of the system can be written as : @xmath19 the first term in the right - hand side ( r.h.s . ) of eq . ( [ eq1 ] ) represents the confinement potential , where @xmath20 is given by : @xmath21 for the hard - wall confinement , @xmath22 for parabolic one - dimensional potential ( in the @xmath23-direction ) , and by @xmath24 for parabolic circular confinement . here @xmath25 is the width of the channel ( for the hard - wall potential ) , @xmath26 is the mass of the particles , @xmath27 is the strenght of the parabolic 1d confining potential , @xmath28 is the coordinate of the minimum of the potential energy and @xmath29 is the displacement of the @xmath30th particle from @xmath28 ( for the parabolic circular potential ) . note that in case of a circular channel , @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the radius of the channel .    the second term in the r.h.s . of eq . ( [ eq1 ] ) represents the interaction potential between the particles . for the screened couloumb potential , @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the charge of each particle , @xmath35 is the dieletric constant of the medium , @xmath36 is the distance between @xmath30th and @xmath37th particles , and @xmath38 is the debye screening length . substituting ( [ eq3 ] ) into eq . ( [ eq1 ] ) , we obtain the potential energy of the system @xmath39 : @xmath40 in order to reveal important parameters which characterize the system , we rewrite the energy @xmath39 in a dimensionless ( @xmath41 ) form by making use of the following variable transformations : @xmath42 , @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the mean inter - particle distance . the energy of the system then becomes @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the screening parameter of the interaction potential . in our simulations in sec . iii , we use a typical value of @xmath47 for colloidal systems and @xmath48 m . the hard - wall confinement potential is written as @xmath49 where @xmath50 is scaled by the inter - particle distance @xmath44 . we also introduce a dimensionless parameter @xmath51 which is a measure of the strenght of the parabolic 1d confinement potential .    for colloidal particles moving in a nonmagnetic liquid , their motion is overdamped and thus the stochastic langevin equations of motion can be reduced to those for brownian particles @xcite : @xmath52.\end{aligned}\ ] ] note , however , that in sec .  iv we will deal with massive metallic balls and therefore we will keep the inertial term in the langevin equations of motion .    in eq . ( [ eq7 ] ) , @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the position , the self - diffusion coefficient ( measured in m@xmath56/s ) and the mass ( in kg ) of the @xmath30th particle , respectively , @xmath57 is the time ( in seconds ) , @xmath58 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath59 is the absolute temperature of the system . finally , @xmath60 is a randomly fluctuating force , which obeys the following conditions : @xmath61 and @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the friction coefficient . ( [ eq7 ] ) can be written in dimensionless form as follows : @xmath64,\end{aligned}\ ] ] where we use the following transformation @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and introduced a coupling parameter @xmath67 , which is the ratio of the average potential energy to the average kinetic energy , @xmath68 , such that @xmath69 . the time @xmath70 is expressed in seconds and distances are expressed in units of the interparticle distance @xmath44 . in what follows , we will abandon the prime ( @xmath71 ) notation . we have used a first order finite difference method ( euler method ) to integrate eq . ( [ eq8 ] ) numerically . in the case of a straight channel , periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) were applied in the @xmath72-direction while in the @xmath23-direction the system is confined either by a hard - wall or by a parabolic potential . also , we use a timestep @xmath73 and the coupling parameter is set to @xmath74 . for a circular channel , we use polar coordinates @xmath75 and model a 2d narrow channel of radius @xmath32 with parabolic potential - energy profile across the channel , i.e. , in the @xmath76-direction . in order to characterize the diffusion of the system , we calculate the msd as follows : @xmath77^{2 }   \big\rangle_{\delta t},\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the total number of particles and @xmath78 represents a time average over the time interval @xmath79 . note that in the general case ( e.g. , for small circular channels with the number of particles @xmath80  see sec . iv ) the calculated msd was averaged over time _ and _ over the number of ensembles  @xcite . however , we found that for large @xmath16 ( i.e. , several hundred ) the calculated msd for various ensemble realizations coincide ( with a maximum deviation within the thickness of the line representing the msd ) . to keep the inter - particle distance approximately equal to unity , we defined the total number of particles @xmath16 for a 1d and q1d system as @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the size of the simulation box ( in dimensionless units ) in the @xmath72-direction . in our simulations for a straight channel geometry , we typically used @xmath83 particles . we study the system for two different types of confinement potential : ( i ) a parabolic 1d potential in the @xmath23-direction , which can be tuned by the confinement strength @xmath84 and ( ii ) a hard - wall potential , where particles are confined by two parallel walls separated by a distance @xmath25 . the results of calculations of the msd as a function of time for different values of the confinement strength @xmath84 [ eq . ( [ ki ] ) ] and the width of the channel @xmath25 are presented in fig.[msdparabolic](a)-(c ) and fig.[msdhardwall](a)-(c ) , respectively .     as a function of time for different values of @xmath84 . different diffusion regimes can be distinguished : normal diffusion regime ( @xmath85 ) and intermediate subdiffusive regime ( itr , @xmath86 ) . note that for the case of @xmath84 = 1.5 , there is a normal diffusion regime ( i.e. @xmath85 ) after the itr . the dashed and solid lines in ( a)-(c ) are a guide to the eye . panel ( d ) shows the dependence of the slope ( @xmath0 ) of the msd curves ( in the itr , characterized by an apparent power - law ; @xmath1 @xmath2 ) on the confinement strength @xmath84.,width=264 ]     as a function of time for different values of @xmath25 . different diffusion regimes can be distinguished : normal diffusion regime ( @xmath85 ) and intermediate subdiffusive regime ( itr , @xmath86 ) . note that for the case of @xmath25 = 0.60 , there is a normal diffusion regime ( i.e. @xmath85 ) after the itr . the dashed and solid lines in ( a)-(c ) are a guide to the eye . panel ( d ) shows the dependence of the slope ( @xmath0 ) of the msd curves ( in the itr , characterized by an apparent power - law ; @xmath1 @xmath2 ) on the confinement parameter @xmath25.,width=264 ]    initially , in both cases ( i.e. , a parabolic and a hard - wall confinement potential ) , the system exhibits a short - time normal diffusion behavior , where @xmath1 @xmath8 . this is the typical initial `` free - particle '' diffusion regime . after this initial regime , there is an intermediate subdiffusive regime ( itr ) . as discussed in ref . @xcite , the itr shows an apparent power - law behavior @xcite , where @xmath15 , and it was also found previously in different diffusion models @xcite . in the itr , we found a sfd regime for either a channel with strong parabolic confinement [ @xmath87 ( fig .  [ msdparabolic](a ) ) ] or a narrow hard - wall channel [ @xmath88 ( fig . [ msdhardwall](a ) ) ] . this is due to the fact that for large ( small ) values of @xmath84 ( @xmath25 ) , the confinement prevents particles from passing each other . the results for @xmath0 in the itr are shown as a function of @xmath84 and @xmath25 in fig . [ msdparabolic](d ) and fig . [ msdhardwall](d ) , respectively . as can be seen in fig . [ msdparabolic](d ) [ fig . [ msdhardwall](d ) ] , @xmath0 increases with decreasing @xmath84 [ with increasing @xmath25 ] and thus the sfd condition turns out to be broken . the values of @xmath0 presented in these figures correspond to the minimum of the effective time dependent exponent @xmath90 . following ref . @xcite , @xmath90 is calculated using the `` double logarithmic time derivative '' @xmath91 and the results are shown in fig . [ alphatime ] .     as a function of time , calculated from eq . ( [ alphatime ] ) for different values of the confinement parameters @xmath84 and @xmath25 , respectively.,width=302 ]    the different diffusive regimes , i.e. normal diffusion regime ( @xmath85 ) and sfd ( @xmath92 ) , were also found recently in finite - size systems @xcite although the transition from sfd to normal diffusion was not analyzed . the @xmath0-dependence on both the confinement parameters ( i.e. , @xmath93 and @xmath94 ) presents a different qualitative behavior , namely , the sfd regime is reached after a smoother crossover in the parabolic confinement case as compared to the hardwall case . a similar smoother crossover is also found in the case of a circular channel with parabolic confinement in the radial direction . a more detailed discussion on these two different types of the behavior of @xmath0 will be provided in sec . [ circularchannel ] .      for small values of the parabolic confinement ( e.g. , @xmath96 ) , the msd curves present three different diffusive regimes : ( i ) a short - time normal diffusion regime , where msd @xmath1 @xmath8 ; ( ii ) a subdiffusive regime with @xmath1 @xmath2 , where @xmath15 and ( iii ) a `` long - time '' diffusion regime , which is characterized by @xmath1 @xmath8 . note that the `` long - time '' term used here is not to be confused with the long - time used for _ infinite _ systems , as discussed in the introduction . however , for large values of the parabolic confinement ( e.g. , @xmath87 ) , we observe only two distinct diffusive regimes , namely : ( i ) a short - time normal diffusion regime ( @xmath1 @xmath8 ) and ( ii ) a sfd regime ( i.e. , @xmath1 @xmath7 ) . one question that arises naturally is whether this normal diffusion regime ( i.e. , @xmath1 @xmath8 for `` long - times '' ) is an effect of the _ colletive _ motion of the system ( center - of - mass motion ) or an effect of the single - particle jumping process , since the confinement potential @xmath96 allows particles bypass . in order to answer this question , we calculate the number of crossing events @xmath95 as a function of time and results are shown in fig . [ ncross](a ) . we found that for small values of the confinement potential ( e.g. , @xmath96 ) the number of crossing events grows linearly in time , i.e. , @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is the rate of crossing events . on the other hand , a strong confinement potential ( e.g. , @xmath87 ) prevents particles from bypassing , and thus @xmath99 during the whole simulation time . therefore , the `` long - time '' normal diffusive behavior ( i.e. , @xmath1 @xmath8 for `` long - times '' ) found in our simulations for the case where the sf ( single - file ) condition is broken ( e.g. , @xmath96 ) is _ not _ due to a collective ( center - of - mass ) diffusion . instead , this normal diffusive behaviour is due to a single - particle jumping process , which happens with a constant rate @xmath100 for the case of small values of the confinement ( @xmath96 ) and @xmath101 ( for @xmath87 ) . the same analysis was done for the case of the hard - wall confinement potential , and the results are found to be the same as for the parabolic confinement . nevertheless , we point out that the collective diffusion does indeed exist , but our results from simulations do not allow us to observe this collective ( center - of - mass ) diffusion regime because of the large size of our chain of particles ( @xmath102 ) . simulations with @xmath103 , and excluding the possibility of mutual bypass ( strong confinement potential ) , allowed us to observe that the @xmath1 @xmath8 regime is recovered in the `` long - time '' limit . in sec . v , we will further discuss the long - time limit using a model of discrete sites . as we demonstrated above , the transition from pure 1d diffusion ( sfd ) characterized by @xmath92 to a quasi-1d behavior ( with @xmath104 ) could be either more `` smooth '' ( as in fig . 1(d ) , for a parabolic confinement ) or more `` abrupt '' ( as in fig . 2(d ) , for a hard - wall confinement ) . one can intuitively expect that this difference in behavior can manifest itself also in the crossing events rate @xmath98 , i.e. , that @xmath98 as a function of @xmath84 ( or @xmath105 ) should display a clear signature of either `` smooth '' or `` abrupt '' behavior .    however , the link between the two quantities , i.e. , the exponent , @xmath106 , and the crossing events rate , @xmath107 is not that straightforward . to understand this , let us refer to the long - time limit ( which will be addressed in detail within the discrete - site model in sec . as we show , in the long - time limit the exponent @xmath0 is defined by one of the two conditions : @xmath101 ( then @xmath92 ) or @xmath100 ( then @xmath108 ) and it does _ not _ depend on the specific value of @xmath98 provided it is nonzero . therefore , in the long - time limit the transition between 1d to 2d behavior _ is not sensitive _ to the particular behavior of the function @xmath107 . although for `` intermediate '' times ( considered in this section ) the condition @xmath101 _ or _ @xmath109 is not critical , nevertheless , very small change in the crossing events rate @xmath107 strongly influences the behavior of the exponent @xmath106 . this is illustrated in figs . 4(b , c ) . in fig . 4(b ) , the function @xmath110 gradually decreases from 1.45 to 0 for @xmath84 varying in a _ broad _ interval from 1.5 to 3 ( note that the segment of @xmath110 for @xmath111 is nonzero which can be seen in the inset of fig . 4(b ) showing the derivative @xmath112 ) . correspondingly , the transition from @xmath92 to @xmath113 in that interval of @xmath84 is `` smooth '' ( see fig . 1(d ) ) . on the other hand , the function @xmath114 shown in fig . 4(c ) mainly changes ( note the change of the slope @xmath115 shown in the inset of fig .  4(c ) ) in a _ narrow _ interval @xmath116 . respectively , the transition for the function @xmath117 occurs in the narrow interval @xmath116 and thus is ( more ) `` abrupt '' .     as a function of time for @xmath118 particles , for @xmath96 ( black open circles ) and @xmath87 ( green open diamonds ) . the solid red line is a linear fit to @xmath95 . panels ( b ) and ( c ) show the rate of the crossing events @xmath119 as a function of the confinement potential parameters ( @xmath84 and @xmath25 ) . the insets in the panels ( b ) and ( c ) show the derivatives , @xmath112 and @xmath115 , correspondingly . , width=302 ]      for the ideal 1d case , particles are located on a straight line . increasing the width @xmath25 of the confining channel will lead to a zig - zag transition @xcite . this zig - zag configuration can be seen as a distorted triangular configuration in this transition zone . further increase of @xmath25 brings the system into the 2d regime , where the normal diffusion behavior is recovered ( see fig .  [ hardsnap ] ) . for the parabolic 1d confinement , we can see [ fig . [ distpy](a ) ] that the distribution of particles @xmath120 along the channel is symmetric along the axis @xmath121 . also , for large values of @xmath84 ( e.g. , @xmath87 ) particles are confined in the @xmath23-direction and thus can move only in the @xmath72-direction , forming a single - chain structure . as the confinement decreases ( @xmath122 ) , the distribution of particles @xmath120 broadens resulting in the crossover from the sfd regime ( @xmath87 ) to the 2d normal diffusion regime ( @xmath123 ) . note that for small values of @xmath84 ( e.g. , @xmath123 ) , the system forms a two - chain structure ( represented by two small peaks of @xmath120 in fig . [ distpy](a ) ) , thus allowing particles to pass each other . md simulation steps ) confined by the channel of width ( a ) @xmath88 , ( b ) @xmath124 and ( c ) @xmath125.,width=302 ]     along the @xmath23-direction are shown for ( a ) different values of @xmath84 ( parabolic 1d confinement ) and ( b ) four different values of the width @xmath25 of the channel ( hard - wall confinement).,width=302 ] in the previous section , we analyzed the transition ( crossover ) from the sfd regime to 2d diffusion in narrow channels of increasing width . the analysis was performed for a straight channel with either hard - wall or parabolic confinement potential . however , in terms of possible experimental verification of the studied effect , one faces an obvious limitation of this model : although easy in simulation , it is hard to experimentally fulfill the periodic boundary conditions at the ends of an _ open _ channel . therefore , in order to avoid this difficulty , in sfd experiments @xcite circular channels were used .    in this section , we investigate the transition ( crossover ) from sfd to 2d - diffusion in a system of interacting particles diffusing in a channel of _ circular _ shape . in particular , we will study the influence of the strength of the confinement ( i.e. , the depth of the potential profile across the channel ) on the diffusive behavior . without loss of generality , we will adhere to the specific conditions and parameters of the experimental set - up used in ref . an additional advantage of this model is that the motion of the system of charged metallic balls @xcite is _ not _ overdamped , and we will solve the full langevin equations of motion to study the diffusive behavior of the system . we consider @xmath16 particles , interacting through a yukawa potential [ eq . ( [ eq3 ] ) ] , which are embedded in a ring channel of radius @xmath32 . we define a parabolic confinement potential across the channel in the form ( [ vc ] ) where parameter @xmath126 is chosen as follows : @xmath127}{2r_{ch } \sin\left(\frac{\phi_i-\phi_j}{2}\right)},\ ] ] when all the particles are equidistantly distributed along the bottom of the circular channel . it should be noted that in this case , @xmath128 is approximately equal to @xmath129 due to the weak yukawa interaction , which slightly shifts the particles away from the bottom of the channel . such a choice of @xmath128 is related to the fact that we study the influence of the confinement on the diffusion and , therefore , the potential energy of the particles must be of the order of the inter - particle interaction energy . parameter @xmath130 characterizes the distance where the external potential reaches the value @xmath131 , and @xmath129 is the energy of the ground state of the system of @xmath16 particles as defined by eq . ( [ eq4 ] ) . parameter @xmath132 plays the role of a control parameter . by changing @xmath132 we can manipulate the strength of the confinement and , therefore , control the fulfillment of the single - file condition . increase in @xmath132 corresponds to a decrease in the depth of the confinement ( [ vc ] ) which leads to the expansion of the area of radial localization of particles . therefore , an increase of @xmath132 results in a similar effect ( i.e. , spatial delocalization of particles ) as an increase of temperature , i.e. , parameter @xmath132 can be considered as an `` effective temperature '' . note that such a choice of the parameter that controls the confinement strength is rather realistic . in the experiment of ref . @xcite with metallic balls , the parabolic confinement was created by an external electric field , and the depth of the potential was controlled by tuning the strength of the field .    to study diffusion of charged metallic balls , we solve the langevin equation of motion in the general form ( i.e. , with the inertial term @xmath133 ) , @xmath134 where @xmath135  kg @xcite is the mass of a particle , @xmath63 is the friction coefficient ( inverse to the mobility ) . here all the parameters of the system were chosen following the experiment @xcite , and @xmath136 , @xmath137 ( which is a typical experimental value , see , e.g. , also @xcite ) . correspondingly , mass is measured in kg , length in m , and time in seconds . also , following ref . @xcite , we took a channel of radius @xmath138  mm ( in the experiment  @xcite , the external radius of the channel was 10  mm , and the channel width 2  mm ; note that in our model we do not define the channel width : the motion of a particle in the transverse direction is only restricted by the parabolic confinement potential ) . we also took experimentally relevant number of diffusing particles , @xmath16 , varying from @xmath139 to @xmath140 ( in the experiment  @xcite , the ring channel contained @xmath139 or @xmath141 diffusing balls ) . [ figsnapshots ] shows the results of calculations of the trajectories of @xmath80 particles diffusing in a ring of radius @xmath142  mm for the first 10@xmath143 md steps for various values of the parameter @xmath132 . as can be seen from the presented snapshots , the radial localization of particles weakens with increasing @xmath132 . at a certain value of @xmath132 this leads to the breakdown of the single - file behavior ( figs . [ figsnapshots](c)-(f ) ) . particles diffusing in a ring of radius @xmath142  mm for @xmath144 consequent time steps for different values of @xmath132 . @xmath132=1 ( a ) , 2 ( b ) , 3 ( c ) , 5 ( d ) , 7 ( e ) , 9 ( f ) . , width=321 ]      it is convenient to introduce the distribution of the probability density of particles in the channel @xmath145 along the radial direction @xmath76 . in order to calculate the function @xmath146 we divided the circular channel in a number of coaxial thin rings . the ratio of the number of observations of particles in a sector of radius @xmath147 to the total number of observations during the simulation is defined as the probability density @xmath148 . in fig . [ figprob ] , the probability density @xmath146 is presented for different values of @xmath132 . with increasing @xmath132 , the distribution of the probability density @xmath146 broaden and the maximum of the function @xmath146 shifts away from the center of the channel ( see fig .  [ figprob ] ) . the latter is explained by the softening of the localization of particles with increasing @xmath132 , which tend to occupy an area with a larger radius due to the repulsive inter - particle interaction . simultaneously , the distribution of the probability density @xmath146 acquires an additional bump indicating the nucleation of a two - channel particle distribution @xcite . the observed broadening and deformation of the function @xmath146 is indicative of a gradual increase of the probability of mutual bypass of particles ( i.e. , the violation of the sf ( single - file ) condition , also called the `` overtake probability '' @xcite ) with increasing @xmath132 .     in a circular channel of radius @xmath142  mm along the radial direction @xmath76 . the different curves correspond to various @xmath132 . increasing @xmath132 the width of the distribution @xmath146 increases due to a weakening of the confinement . , width=321 ]     created by a particle ( red ( grey ) circle ) and the qualitative distribution of the probability density of particles in circular channel @xmath146 ( green ( light grey ) line ) along the radial direction @xmath76 . the function @xmath149 determines an approximate radial distance between particles when the potential barrier @xmath150 becomes `` permeable '' for given temperature @xmath59 . the function @xmath151 characterizes a width of the distribution @xmath146 at this temperature @xmath59 . , width=283 ]    let us now discuss a qualitative criterion for the breakdown of sfd , i.e. , when the _ majority _ of particles leave the sfd mode . for this purpose , let us consider a particle in the potential created by its close neighbor ( which is justified in case of short - range yukawa interparticle interaction and low density of particles in a channel ) shown in fig . different lines show the interparticle potential @xmath152 as a function of angle @xmath153 for different radii @xmath76 . for small values of @xmath132 , the center of the distribution @xmath146 ( see fig . 7 ) almost coincides with the center of the channel ( i.e. , with the minimum of the confinement potential profile ) and the distribution @xmath146 is narrow . therefore , mutual passage of particles is impossible , i.e. , the sf condition is fulfilled . the asymmetric broadening of the function @xmath146 with increasing @xmath132 results in an increasing probability of mutual bypass of particles which have to overcome a barrier @xmath150 ( see fig .  [ fig7 ] ) . this becomes possible when @xmath154 . in other words , the thermal energy @xmath155 determines some minimal width @xmath149 between adjacent particles when the breakdown of the sf condition becomes possible . it is clear that `` massive '' violation of the sf condition ( i.e. , when the majority of particles bypass each other ) occurs when the halfwidth @xmath151 of the distribution of the probability density @xmath146 obeys the condition : @xmath156 the function @xmath151 is defined by the ratio of the thermal energy @xmath155 to the external potential @xmath157 and is of the same order as @xmath158 : @xmath159 therefore the criterion ( [ nsf01 ] ) can be presented in the form : @xmath160    this qualitative analysis of the breakdown of the sfd regime clarifies the role of the width and the shape of the distribution of the probability density influenced by the asymmetry of the circular channel . the msd @xmath161 is calculated as a function of time @xmath57 as : @xmath162 ^ 2 \right\rangle_t,\ ] ] where @xmath163 is the total number of particles of an ensemble and @xmath164 is the total number of ensembles . in our calculations , the number of ensembles was chosen 100 for a system consisting of 20 particles . the time dependence of the msd for different values of @xmath132 is shown in fig . [ figsfdring](a)(c ) . initially the system exhibits normal diffusion , where @xmath165 @xmath8 . this regime is followed by an intermediate subdiffusive regime , where the @xmath165 @xmath2 ( @xmath15 ) . for longer times , the system recovers `` long - time '' normal diffusion ( see discussions in sec . iiib ) , with @xmath165 @xmath8 . as in the case of straight channel geometry , this second crossover ( i.e. , from intermediate subdiffusion to `` long - time '' normal diffusion ) can also be due to two other reasons : ( i ) due to a collective ( center - of - mass ) diffusion or ( ii ) due to a single - particle jumping process . however , for the simulations in the case of a circular geometry , the number of particles is relatively small ( taking the fact that this is a finite - size system ) , and therefore , the crossover from sublinear to linear regime is due to a collective ( center - of - mass ) diffusion . we further address this issue in sec . v , where we consider a discrete site model and we exclude the center - of - mass motion . [ figsfdring](d ) shows @xmath0 as a function of @xmath132 . the function @xmath166 experiences a monotonic gradual crossover from the @xmath92 to a @xmath167-regime . note that the observed deviation from the normal diffusion behavior for large @xmath132 ( fig . [ figsfdring ] ) is related to the presence of , though weak but nonzero , external confinement in the radial direction . this change of the diffusive behavior is explained by a weakening of the average radial localization of particles with increase of @xmath132 ( fig . [ figprob ] ) and , as a consequence , by an increase of the probability of mutual bypass of particles .     as a function of time for different values of the `` effective '' temperature @xmath132 = ( a ) 1 , ( b ) 2 , and ( c ) 3 . here ( d ) the diffusion exponent @xmath0 as a function of @xmath132 . increase of the `` effective '' temperature @xmath132 leads to the gradual transformation of the single - file regime of diffusion into the diffusion regime of free particles.,width=264 ]    the observed crossover between the 1d single - file and 2d diffusive regimes , i.e. , @xmath166-dependence , shows a significant different qualitative behavior as compared to the case of a hard - wall confinement potential considered in sec . [ straight ] , where a rather sharp transition between the two regimes was found [ fig . [ msdhardwall](d ) ] . the different behavior is due to the different confinement profiles and can be understood from the analysis of the distribution of the probability density of particles for these two cases . in the case of a hard - wall channel , the uncompensated ( i.e. , by the confinement ) interparticle repulsion leads to a higher particle density near the boundaries rather than near the center of the channel ( see fig .  [ hardsnap ] and fig .  [ distpy](b ) ) . as a consequence , the breakdown of the sf condition with increasing width of the channel  happens simultaneously for _ many _ particles in the vicinity of the boundary resulting in a sharp transition ( see fig . [ msdhardwall](d ) ) . on the contrary , in the case of parabolic confinement , the density distribution function has a maximum  sharp or broad , depending on the confinement strength  near the center of the channel ( see figs .  [ distpy](a ) and [ figprob ] ) . with increasing the `` width '' of the channel ( i.e. , weakening its strength ) , only a small _ fraction _ of particles undergoes the breakdown of the sf condition . this fraction gradually increases with decreasing strength of the confinement , therefore resulting in a smooth crossover between the two diffusion regimes . the calculated msd for different geometries and confinement potentials allowed us to explain the evolution of the subdiffusive regime with varying width of the channel ( or potential strength in case of a parabolic potential ) . however , the obtained results are only valid for the intermediate regime and therefore they only describe the `` onset '' of the long - time behavior . the problem of accessing the long - time behavior in a finite chain is related to the fact that sooner or later ( i.e. , depending on the chain length ) the interacting system will evolve into a collective , or `` single - particle '' , diffusion mode which is characterized by @xmath85 . thus the question is whether the observed behavior holds for the long - time limit , i.e. , is the transition from @xmath169 to @xmath170 behavior smooth ?    to answer this question , we considered a simple model , i.e. , a linear discrete chain of fixed sites filled with either particles or `` holes '' ( i.e. , sites not occupied by particles ) ( for details , see ref . @xcite ; this model was also recently used in ref . the particles can move along the chain only due to the exchange with adjacent vacancies ( i.e. , with holes ) . within this model , the long - time diffusion behavior was described _ analytically _ for an infinite linear chain as well as for a finite cyclic chain  @xcite . in particular , this model predicts that : ( i ) if the chain is infinite then the long - time power law of the diffusion curve @xmath0 is @xmath171 ( i.e. , msd @xmath1 @xmath7 ) ; ( ii ) if the chain is finite then the subdiffusive regime with @xmath172 is followed by either @xmath173 regime ( if the cyclic boundary condition is realized ) , or by @xmath174 regime , i.e. , the regime of saturation ( if no cyclic boundary condition is imposed  @xcite ) . the latter regime is reached for times longer than the `` diffusion time '' of a `` hole '' along the whole chain @xmath175 .    let us now apply this model to a finite - size chain of particles . for this purpose , we assume that adjacent particles are able to exchange their positions with some probability @xmath176 at every time step . for example , probability @xmath177 means that a couple of any adjacent particles certainly exchange their positions once for every @xmath178 time steps . the results of our calculations of the msd performed using this model are presented in fig . [ figsfdsc](a ) . we used the following parameters : the chain length is @xmath179 sites and @xmath180 hole . averaging was done over @xmath181 ensembles . the calculation was performed for the following values of the probability : @xmath182 , and @xmath183 . ( a ) and corrected msd @xmath1@xmath184 ( b ) as a function of time for different values of the probability @xmath176 of bypassing . averaging was done over @xmath185 ensembles.,width=283 ]    we see in fig . [ figsfdsc](a ) clearly the above - mentioned two diffusion regimes , i.e. , with the msd @xmath1 @xmath7 and @xmath8 . the characteristic time @xmath175 shifts towards lower values with increasing @xmath176 . however this analysis ( fig . [ figsfdsc](a ) ) does not allow to distinguish the contributions to the long - time behavior ( @xmath8 ) due to : ( i ) the breakdown of single - file condition ( i.e. , diffusion due to particle exchanges ) , and ( ii ) the `` collective '' diffusion ( chain `` rotation '' ) .    to overcome this difficulty , we exclude the `` collective '' diffusion of the system and introduce a modified msd @xmath1@xmath184 ( which is so - called `` roughness '' of the system of particles , as discussed in ref . @xcite ) as follows : @xmath186 where @xmath187 is the average over time ; @xmath188 is the average of an ensemble of particles at a given time , or `` collective '' coordinate . it should be noted that @xmath189 . if the system does not experience `` collective '' diffusion then @xmath190 and the modified msd coincides with the conventional one :    @xmath191    the diffusion curves calculated by using the modified msd are presented in fig .  [ figsfdsc](b ) . for @xmath192 , the diffusion curve ( shown by black open squares ) after the subdiffusive regime reaches saturation ( i.e. , @xmath1@xmath184 = const ) . the observed behavior is similar to that of a finite linear chain with fixed ends ( see ref . @xcite ) . for @xmath193 , all the diffusion curves in the long - time limit are characterized by @xmath85 , _ independent _ of the value of the probability @xmath176 , as seen in fig . [ figsfdsc](b ) . in other words , the long - time diffusion does _ not _ depends on the probability of mutual exchanges of particles and has the same long - time behavior for _ any _ probability @xmath193 . here we would like to emphasize again that the long - time behavior of the diffusion curves is free from the `` collective '' diffusion effect and is only determined by particle jump diffusion . increasing a number of sites in the model corresponds , in fact , approaching to the model of infinite chain . we have found that the increasing a number of sites leads to growth of the @xmath1@xmath184 limit of saturation , on the one hand , and to a shift of @xmath175 to larger @xmath57 , on the other hand . hence , extrapolating our results to the case of infinite chain , we can conclude that in this case as well as in the case of finite - size chain , the breakdown of single - file condition leads to an abrupt transition from subdiffusive to the normal diffusion regime . the difference in the diffusive curves is just the time @xmath194 from subdiffusive regime to the normal regime : for low @xmath176 it ( @xmath194 ) is long enough while for high @xmath176 it ( @xmath194 ) is short . it is easy to see that @xmath195 . thus , we can conclude that in the long - time limit the transition from @xmath196 to @xmath197 behavior is _ note that our calculations performed using the modified msd @xmath1@xmath184 reproduce the results of ref . @xcite for a closed `` box '' . this is explained by the fact that in the closed `` box '' geometry the center of mass ( or collective ) diffusion is zero , and it is natural that the roughness ( see ref . @xcite ) and the particles diffusion coincide . we have studied a monodisperse system of interacting particles subject to three types of confinement potentials : ( i ) a 1d hardwall potential , ( ii ) a 1d parabolic confinement potential which both characterize a _ quasi_-1d system , and ( iii ) a circular confining potential , which models a finite size system . in order to study the diffusive properties of the system , we have calculated the mean - squared displacement ( msd ) numerically through molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations . for the case where particles diffuse in a straight line in a q1d channel , different diffusion regimes were found for different values of the parameters of the confining potential ( @xmath84 or @xmath25 ) . we have found that the normal diffusion is suppressed if the channel width @xmath25 is between @xmath198 and @xmath199 ( or by @xmath200 , for the case of parabolic 1d confinement ) , leading the system to a sfd regime for intermediate time scales . for values of @xmath201 , particles will be able to cross each other and the sfd regime will be no longer present . the case of a circular channel corresponds to , e.g. , the set - up used in experiments with sub - millimetric metallic massive balls diffusing in a ring with a parabolic potential profile created by an external electric field . the strength of the potential ( which determines the effective `` width '' of the channel ) can be tuned by the field strength . contrary to the case of hard - wall confinement , where the transition ( regarding the calculation of the scaling exponent ( @xmath0 ) of the msd @xmath1@xmath2 ) is sharp , a smooth crossover between the 1d single - file and the 2d diffusive regimes was observed . this behavior is explained by different profiles for the distribution of the particle density for the hard - wall and parabolic confinement profiles . in the former case , the particle density reaches its maximum near the boundaries of the channel resulting in a massive breakdown of the sf condition and thus in a sharp transition between the different diffusive regimes . in the latter case , on the contrary , the density distribution function has a maximum near the center which broadens with decreasing strength of the confinement . this results in a smooth crossover between the two diffusion regimes , i.e. , sfd and 2d regime . the analysis of the crossing events , i.e. , the rate of the crossing events @xmath98 as a function of the confinement parameter @xmath84 or @xmath105 , supports these results : the function @xmath107 displays a clear signature of either `` smooth '' or `` abrupt '' behavior . we also addressed the case of a finite discrete chain of diffusing particles . it was shown that in this case the breakdown of the single - file condition ( i.e. , when the probability @xmath176 of particles bypassing each other is non - zero ) leads to an abrupt transition from a subdiffusive regime to the normal diffusion regime . this work was supported by cnpq , funcap ( pronex grant ) , the `` odysseus '' program of the flemish government , the flemish science foundation ( fwo - vl ) , the bilateral program between flanders and brazil , and the collaborative program cnpq - fwo - vl . as recently shown when studying single - trajectory averages  @xcite , time average ( ta ) may differ from ensemble average ( ea ) msd not only for nonergodic processes ( for example , for anomalous diffusion described by continuous time random walks ( ctrws ) models  @xcite ) , but also for some ergodic processes in small complex systems . this apparent power - law behavior is characterized by msd @xmath1@xmath2 , and it is an intermediate phenomena due to the interplay between the crossover from the msd @xmath1@xmath7 regime to @xmath1@xmath8 regime . for details , see ref .  @xcite .","The text discusses the dynamics of systems of interacting particles in confined geometries, specifically in the context of single-file diffusion (SFD) and its relation to collective diffusion.

**Key points:**

 we calculate numerically the mean - squared displacement ( msd ) and investigate the influence of the width of the channel ( or the strength of the confinement potential ) on diffusion in finite - size channels of different shapes ( i.e. , straight and circular ) . the transition from single - file diffusion ( sfd ) to the two - dimensional diffusion regime 
 is investigated . 
 this transition ( regarding the calculation of the scaling exponent ( @xmath0 ) of the msd @xmath1 @xmath2 ) as a function of the width of the channel , is shown to change depending on the channel s confinement profile . 
 in particular the transition can be either smooth ( i.e. , for a parabolic confinement potential ) or rather sharp / stepwise ( i.e. , for a hard - wall potential ) , as distinct from infinite channels where this transition is abrupt . 
 this result can be explained by qualitatively different distributions of the particle density for the different confinement potentials .",48458,516,1167,41.96 seconds,31.38 MB,0.30081300813008127,0.07377049180327869,0.1951219512195122,0.81352698802948,medium
"evidences accumulated in the past decade point to the phenomenon that feedback from active galactic nuclei ( agns ) plays a crucial role in galaxy formation and evolution . outflows in agns connect the central supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) to their host galaxies , and regulate their co - evolution ( granato et al . 2004 ; scannapieco & oh 2004 ; hopkins et al . 2008 ; also see antonuccio - delogu & silk 2010 for a recent review ) . observationally , the most direct and obvious performance of agn outflows is the high - speed blueshifted broad absorption lines ( bals ) . because of the high fraction in optically selected quasars ( 10%-20% ) , high - ionization bal ( hibal ) quasars are widely studied , with strong absorption troughs in high ionization ions such as , , , and , up to a velocity of @xmath11 ( e.g. , weymann et al . 1991 ; trump et al . 2006 ; gibson et al . bals are also detected occasionally ( @xmath12 in bal quasars and @xmath13 in all quasars ) in low ionization species such as and , named as low - ionization bals ( lobals ) ( e.g. , weymann et al . 1991 ; reichard et al . 2003 ; zhang et al . moreover , felobal quasars have been observed to exhibit the broad absorption troughs in and/or , which are rare and only found in only @xmath12 of lobal quasars ( hall et al . 2002 ) . statistical studies are widely used to explain the bal phenomenon . bal quasars on average have red continua ( weymann et al . 1991 ; richards et al . 2003 ; zhang et al . 2010 , 2014 ) weak x - ray emission ( e.g. , green et al . 1995 ; brinkmann et al . 1999 ; wang et al . 1999 ; brandt et al . 2000 ; gallagher et al . 2002 , 2006 ; fan et al . 2009 ) , are more frequently detected in quasars with higher eddington ratio and higher luminosity ( ganguly et al . 2007 ; zhang et al . 2010 , 2014 ) . furthermore , the outflow velocity and strength are tied to the properties of quasars . observed outflow velocities increase with the blueness of uv spectral slope , the enhancement of black hole accretion and the equivalent width of emission ( hamann 1998 ; laor & brandt 2002 ; gungly et al . 2007 ; misawa et al . 2007 ; baskin et al . 2013 ; zhang et al . 2014 ) . in particular , the minimum velocity of absorption is even more strongly correlated with uv spectral slope than the maximum velocity ( zhang et al . these findings indicate the primary role of radiatively driven winds in the outflow phenomenon , and the importance of the spectral energy distribution shape ( sed ) in governing the dynamics of outflows . meanwhile , all outflow parameters dramatically and monotonically increase with hot dust emission . these correlations can be more naturally interpreted as the dusty outflow scenario rather than the dust - free outflow scenario , where the dust is intrinsic to the outflows or interaction with torus clouds ( wang et al . 2013 ; zhang et al . 2014 ) .    on the other hand , the study of variation of bal troughs and the associated rare absorption systems , i.e. , lobals , and unusual bals ( mostly felobals ) can provide a new and more effective perspective to understand the physical conditions , locations and origins of the absorbers , and constraint on the outflow mechanism , which gradually becomes a hot topic of the bal research ( e.g. , hall et al . 2002 , 2011 ; zhou et al . 2006 ; lundgren et al . 2007 ; gibson et al . 2008 , 2010 ; krongold et al . 2010 ; zhang et al . 2011 , 2015a , 2015b ; capellupo et al . 2012 ; vivek et al . 2012 , 2014 ; filiz ak et al . 2013 ; welling et al . currently , one of the rarest known bals is non - stellar balmer line absorption . it has previously been reported only in nine objects as follows : ngc 4151 ( hutchings et al . 2002 ) , sdss j112526.12 + 002901.3 ( hall et al . 2002 ; shi et al . in pre . ) , sdss j083942.11 + 380526.3 ( aoki et al . 2006 ) , sdss j125942.80 + 121312.6 ( hall 2007 ; shi et al . in pre . ) , sdss j102839.11 + 450009.4 ( wang et al . 2008 ) , sdss j172341.10 + 555340.5 ( aoki 2010 ) , lbqs 1206 + 1052 ( ji et al . 2012 ) , sdss j222024.59 + 010931.2 ( ji et al . 2013 ) and sdss j112611.63 + 425246.4 ( wang & xu 2015 ) . however , strictly speaking , more than half of them can not be classified as balmer bals based on the criteria for bals ( see table 1 of zhang et al .

dawson et al . 2013 ) and pubilshed in the sdss tenth data release ( dr10 , ahn et al . 2013 ) , the boss spectrum has a wider wavelength range covering 361 nm - 1014 nm with a resolution of 1300 at the blue side and 2600 at the red side , respectively . this instrument is fed by smaller optical fibers , each subtending 2  on the sky ( smee et al . 2013 ) . the near - infrared ( nir ) spectrum of 1523 was taken with the triplespec spectrograph of hale 200-inch telescope ( p200 ) at palomar observatory on april 16 , 2012 . 1523  was exposed four times , each for 240 seconds . triplespec ( wilson et al . 2004 ) is a cross - dispersed nir spectrograph that provides simultaneous wavelength coverage from 0.9 to 2.46 microns at a resolution of 1.4 - 2.9  . the raw data were processed using idl - based spextool software(vacca et al . 2003 and cushing et al . there are two gaps in infrared spectrum around 1.35 microns and 1.85 microns due to the atmosphere transmissivity . fortunately , the redshifted h@xmath0 emission line is detected with the triplespc at @xmath30-band . since the time interval between the sdss dr10 and p200 triplespec observations is just 12 days in observed frame , the data are considered as quasi - simultaneous which we will use in the following analysis . after corrected for the galactic reddening of @xmath48 = 0.021 mag ( schlegel et al . 1998 ) , we transformed the photometric data as well as optical and nir spectrum into the rest frame with its emission redshift , which are shown in red squares , black and blue curves in panle ( a ) of figure [ f2 ] , respectively . the triplespec spectrum , after correcting for the aperture effect , agrees very well with the 2mass photometric data . the sdss and triplespec continuum spectra and wise photometric data suggest two basic components . one is a singel power - law , @xmath49 , representing the nuclear spectrum from the accretion disk ( the pink dashed line ) . it is estimated from continuum windows ( [ 3790 , 3810] , [ 5600 , 5630] , [ 6950 , 7000] ) that are not seriously contaminated by emission lines ( e.g. , forster et al . another is the nir emission bump at @xmath37-band corresponding to the blackbody radiation from the hot dust with @xmath50 k ( green dashed line ) . 1523 is a typical bal quasar , and first classified as a radio - detected bal quasar with @xmath51 km  s@xmath4  by becker et al . it is also contained in the sdss dr5 low - redshift bal quasar sample ( zhang et al . 2010 ) . the measured maximum and minimum velocities of bal trough are -20,000 and -11,500 km  s@xmath4 , and the absorption index @xmath52 is 3227 km  s@xmath4 . we note that the absorption intensity of bal listed in the above literature is likely underestimated as the absorbing troughs of and uv62 overlap each other , and can not be discriminated easily . in zhang et al . ( 2015b ) , 1523 was reidentified to be an ` overlapping - trough ' felobal quasar because of almost no continuum windows below mg ii and causing overlapping absorption troughs .      in panel ( b ) of figure [ f2 ] , we show the spectral details of 1523 from 2300    to 7000  . several regions of the spectrum are absorbed and significantly below the nuclear continuum . except bals of and , balmer bals can be also found by visual examination . we further selected two quasars ( sdss j082806.18 + 063608.3 and sdss j125807.45 + 232921.6 ) using the pair - matching method ( zhang et al . 2014 ; liu et al . 2015 ) , which can match the continuum slop and emission multiplets of 1523  except for the absorbing troughs . compared with the spectra of the two quasars ( green and red curves ) , bal troughs of h@xmath0 and h@xmath53 are evident . we marked the potential bal absorption regions by gray dashed lines .    in order to exactly measure the absorption troughs of balmer lines , we simultaneously fit the continuum and emission lines in the h@xmath53 and h@xmath0 regions using the code of dong et al . ( 2008 ) . in brief , the optical continuum from 4000    to 7000    is approximated by a single power - law ( @xmath54 ) . the value of the slope estimated from continuum windows is took as initial values of @xmath53 . indeed , we also try to use a broken power - law with a break wavelength of 5600  , i.e. , @xmath55 for the h@xmath53 region and @xmath56 for the h@xmath0 region . however , we get the almost same values of @xmath57 and @xmath58 . that means a single power - law is enough to model the continuum . multiplets , both broad and narrow , are modeled using the template provided by vron - cetty et al . emission lines are modeled as multiple gaussians : two gaussians for broad balmer lines , one gaussian for [ ] . there are no significant narrow emission lines in the spectra of 1523 , thus we do not add gaussians for narrow emission lines . additionally , we assume that the [ ] @xmath594959,5007 doublets have the same redshift and profile and their flux ratio is fixed to theoretical value . we notice that the spectrum of sdss j125807.45 + 232921.6 can cover the blue wing ( @xmath60 km  s@xmath4 ) and red wing of broad h@xmath0 line in 1523 ( figure [ f2 ] , panel ( b ) ) , that means h@xmath0 emission is likely unaffected by the bal absorption . thus , we just mask the potential bal absorption regions ( gray dashed lines ) in the fitting .    in top panels of figure [ f3 ] , we show the rest - frame spectra of the sdss and triplespec in black curves and our best - fit models in red curves . a more accurate continuum around h@xmath0 and h@xmath53 , @xmath61 , is shown in pink dashed line . the blue solid lines show the broad and narrow components of optical emission and the green curves represent the three strong balmer lines . in panel ( a ) , the strong narrow 37 multiplets are present in h@xmath53 bal trough . this implies that the outflow winds may only obscure the nuclear continuum and broad emission lines , but not the narrow emission lines . this speculation is consistent with our detailed calculation in  4.2 . furthermore , it can be seen from the normalized spectra of h@xmath0 , h@xmath53 and h@xmath1 ( figure [ f3 ] , panel ( c ) ) that the h@xmath0 trough is polluted by the sky lines . the latter is plotted as the grey line in panel ( b ) of figure [ f3 ] for comparison . that is more remarkable in the normalized spectrum of h@xmath0 in velocity space , the corresponding polluted velocity regions are marked by green lines ( panel ( c ) ) . the ` true ' normalized spectrum in these polluted regions is approximately given through interpolation of those in unpolluted regions . absorption parameters of balmer bal troughs are listed in table [ tab2 ] . lccc wavelength( ) & 6564.41 & 4862.68 & 4341.68 + @xmath62 @xmath63 & 0.6400 & 0.1190 & 0.0446 + @xmath64@xmath65 ( km  s@xmath4 ) & 16,821 & 16,109 & 13,722 + @xmath66@xmath67 ( km  s@xmath4 ) & 5285 & 4095 & 8131 + @xmath52 @xmath68 ( km  s@xmath4 ) & 2726.1@xmath692.6 & 1018.0@xmath691.1 & - + observed depth@xmath70 ( % ) & 33 & 19 & 5 + model depth@xmath70 ( % ) & 33.9 & 18.1 & 7.6      as one know , emission is unique in individual quasars and not exactly the same as the template . furthermore , the ratio of multiplets with different excitation is very sensitive to the temperature and density of the gas . the balmer bal troughs are unfortunately falling into the regimes of multiplets . thus , we used a new template derived from the keck spectrum of iras 07598 + 650 ( vron - cetty et al . 2006 ) to investigate the impact of templates . we first decompose the continuum emission of iras 07598 + 650 from the keck spectrum trough a single power - law fitting based on the above - mentioned continuum windows in  2 . after subtracting the modeled continuum , the residual spectrum which includes broad and narrow and balmer emission lines is used as emission template . in panel ( a ) and ( b ) of figure [ f3 ] , the cyan curves show the new best - fit model , which is the sum of power - law continuum ( pink ) and scaled emission template . it can be seen that the new unabsorbed model around h@xmath0 and h@xmath53 bal troughs is below the best - fitting template causeing weaker h@xmath0 and h@xmath53 absorption . conversely , it shows a stronger h@xmath1 bal than the previous measurement .    in order to further rule out the possibility that balmer bals are resulting from the artifacts of spectral fittings , we constructed a sample of 500 quasars whose spectra can match the slop and primary multiplets , i.e. , @xmath59 4472 - 4731    and @xmath59 5169 - 5325    of 1523 . we used them to normalize the observed spectra of 1523 and calculated the absorption equivalent width of balmer bals . the average values are @xmath71 km  s@xmath4 , @xmath72 km  s@xmath4and @xmath73 km  s@xmath4for h@xmath0 , h@xmath53 and h@xmath1 bals respectively . from the average values and dispersion of the absorption equivalent widths , it can be seen that the uncertainty of templates and/or the continuum determination can affect the measurement of bal parameters , but the existence of balmer bals is unquestionable . percentage absorption depths of the troughs ( table [ tab2 ] ) decrease as the upper term of the transition increases . however , the decline in depth is less than the decrease in transition oscillator strengths ( @xmath74 from h@xmath0 to h@xmath53 ) , leading to the absorption saturated . there is a residual intensity of @xmath75 of the modelled flux at the velocity of the maximum absorption depth ( figure [ f3 ] , panel ( c ) ) , suggesting that the absorption materials only obscure @xmath76 of the total continuum region . theoretically , the absorption depth is defined as @xmath77 for a partially obscured absorber , where @xmath78 is the normalized intensity in the troughs , @xmath79 is percentage covering factor of the absorber and @xmath80 is the optical depth for the relevant ion ( e.g. , hall et al . we can calculate @xmath81 for each balmer trough from the normalized spectrum , and the relative values of @xmath82 are determined by the known oscillator strengths . , where @xmath83 is the ratio of the optical depth of h@xmath53 to that of h@xmath0 , the @xmath84 are the statistical weights , the @xmath85 are the oscillator strengths , and the @xmath86 are the wavelengths of the lines . ] thus , we can estimate @xmath79 and @xmath80 through the observed h@xmath0 and h@xmath53 troughs . the maximum absorption depth of the balmer lines is found to be @xmath87 with coveing factor @xmath88 at the velocity of maximum depth ( table [ tab2 ] ) .    in panel ( d ) of figure [ f3 ] , the covering factor @xmath79 and the optical depth of h@xmath0 absorption @xmath80 are shown as a function of the blueshiftted velocity . the absorption materials have the maximum covering factor at the velocity of the maximum absorption depth ( @xmath89 km  s@xmath4 ) and smaller covering factors at the higher or lower velocities . the optical depths , ie . , the column densities , decrease as a function of the blueshifted velocity from @xmath90 at @xmath91 km  s@xmath4and @xmath92 at @xmath93 km  s@xmath4 . in panel(c ) of figure [ f3 ] , we compared the theoretical absorption troughs ( blue curves ) with the observed normalized spectra for balmer bals . we find that the observed absorption trough for h@xmath1 is shallower than the theoretical profile . the absorption of h@xmath1 is relatively weak and difficult to accurately measure .    using the optical depths derived above , we calculate the column densities of h i as a function of velocity using the general expression ( e.g. , arav et al . 2001 ) @xmath94 where @xmath95 and @xmath96 are the wavelength and the oscillator strength of h@xmath0 , respectively . the results are shown in panel ( d ) of figure [ f3 ] . the total column density is obtained @xmath97 @xmath98 by integrating equation [ colden ] . only the blue wing of the redshifted * @xmath610830 emission line is detected with the triplespec spectrum at h - band ( panel ( a ) of figure [ f2 ] ) , to obtain the unabsorbed spectral intensity around * @xmath610830 , we used the following procedure . we downloaded the high - quality near - infrared broad emission line spectra presented by landt et al . ( 2008 ) and found four objects which can be compared with 1523 : 3c 273 , iras 1750 , he 1228 + 013 and pds 456 . these spectra are similar to that of 1523  in terms of emission lines , but different in their continuum slopes . thus we could use line - free spectral regions in each comparison object to determine the continuum and thus the normalized emission line profiles . we focus on a limited wavelength range between 0.7 and 1.5 @xmath99 m and fit the line - free continuum bands of each object with a single power - law for the accretion disk and a black - body emission component for hot dust emission . then the emission line templates are obtained by dividing the observed spectra by the best - fitting continuum . finally , we multiplied the emission line templates by a single power - law and black - body emission to reconstruct the nir spectrum of 1523 . irac 1750 provided the best - matched nir emission line template with the minimized @xmath100 . in figure [ f4 ] , left panel shows the observed spectra of * @xmath610830 regime overplayed with the best - fit model for 1523 . the pink and orange lines represents the power - low and black - body emission components , respectively . for comparison , we overplotted the emission line template multiplied by a power - law component for irac 1750 ( blue curve ) . right - bottom panel shows the normalized spectrum of * bal trough obtained by dividing the observed spectrum by the best - fitting emission line plus continuum template . trough the comparisons of * and balmer bals , the velocity structure of * bal ( black curve ) is similar to those of balmer bals . table [ tab3 ] gives outflow velocities of the absorber for various balmer bals , as reported in literature . in three cases ( sdss j125942.80 + 121312.6 , lbqs 1206 + 1052 and sdss j222024.59 + 010931.2 ) , the absorption widths of balmer absorption troughs are @xmath101 km  s@xmath4 , and can be classified as balmer bals . however , the widths for other quasars are only several hundred km  s@xmath4 , and could be classified as balmer nals . as shown in table [ tab2 ] , the widths of balmer bals in 1523   are @xmath102 km  s@xmath4 , and are the broadest balmer absorption lines which have ever been found . the redshift of the balmer absorption troughs in 1523 is @xmath103=0.6039@xmath690.0021 , and the blueshifted velocity is @xmath3 km  s@xmath4 , which can even reach @xmath104 km  s@xmath4  with regard to the balmer emission lines . it is a factor of two higher than the maximum blueshifted velocity from the previously known balmer absorption lines . in fact , the blueshifted velocities in two - thirds of the known balmer bals are very small ( only @xmath105 km  s@xmath4 ) . compared with the above two balmer bal quasars with strong [ ] emission in literature , we find that the [ ] line in 1523  is relatively weak ( ) . 1523 also has the weakest [ o iii ] emission among nine agns with balmer absorption lines . 1523 and sdss j222024.59 + 010931.2 are obviously inconsistent with the previous assertion that balmer bals are found in felobal quasars with relatively strong [ ] emission ( aoki et al . 2006 ; hall et al . 2008 ) . among the ten objects in literature and this work , absorption lines are usually detected in * and * . * absorption lines arise from the metastable triplet level * @xmath106 , which is populated by recombination from he@xmath107 with electrons . transitions from this level will generate a series of absorption lines at @xmath593189 , 3889 , 10830  , which are detected in seven quasars , except for sdss j112611.63 + 425246.4 , sdss j125942.80 + 121312.6 and sdss j172341.10 + 555340.5 . another interesting fact is that seven out of ten balmer absorption agns show abundant absorption lines arising from the excited the co - occurrence may indicate that it is probable that these three absorption phenomena are closely related . combined diagnostics of them can determine the density and the ionization state of the absorption gas , and put constraints on the geometry and physical conditions of outflows . for example , the absorbers in sdss j112526.12 + 002901.3 are considered to have the parameters of @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 . the derived distance from the central engine is about @xmath111 pc , which is about 10 times the size of broad emission line region and similar to the radius of the inner edge of dusty torus ( shi et al . , in pre . ) . these estimations provide us some enlightenment about the physical properties of the absorbers in 1523 . 1523 has the strongest balmer bal troughs discovered to date , and exhibits simultaneously the broad absorption lines of * @xmath610830 and both ground and excited state . however , these absorption lines have extremely broad velocity structures and heavily overlap each other , which can not be trivially separated .      since the absorption lines are blended , it is not trivial to obtain the geometry and physical conditions of outflow winds via the combination of the absorption line diagnostics . the large - scale synthesis code cloudy ( c10.00 ; ferland et al . 1998 ) is employed to evaluate the absorption lines of these atoms / ions in the extensive parameter space . the geometry is assumed as a slab - shaped absorbing medium exposed to the ionizing continuum from the central engine with uniform density , metallicity and abundance pattern . the full 371 levels fe@xmath107 model is used to reproduce the absorption , and solar elemental abundance is adopted and the gas is assumed free of dust . in addition , a typical agn multi - component continuum is setted as incident ionizing radiation , where the  big bump "" component peaks at @xmath112 1 ryd and is parameterized by t=@xmath113 k. the x - ray to uv ratio is @xmath114 , and the low - energy slope of the big bump continuum is @xmath115 which is measured in  3.1 . the slope of the x - ray component is setted to the default @xmath116 ( see details in hazy , a brief introduction to cloudy c10 ; http://www.nublado.org ) . we calculated a series of photoionization models with different ionization parameters , electron densities and hydrogen column densities . the ranges of parameters are @xmath117 , @xmath118 and @xmath119 with a step of 0.5 dex . synthetic model spectra are constructed to compare the simulations with observation . the underlying assumption is that other absorptions such as @xmath120 and have the same profile as balmer lines , which means for any ion the fraction of column density at given radial velocity to the integrated ionic column density is the same , and the covering factor as function of radial velocity is the same . therefore in constructing the model spectra , for a given absorption line , the ionic column density predicted by cloudy on the lower level of the transition is distributed to different outflow velocities following the fractional column density distribution versus @xmath121 from balmer series , evaluating the optical depth @xmath122 as function of @xmath121 . and then considering the effect of partial covering as @xmath123 to get the model absorption profile , where @xmath124 is the template for unabsorbed background radiation field . when comparing the model spectrum ( @xmath125 ) with the observed one , the spectrum from 4000 to 7000    covering the three balmer bals are employed in the fitting process . @xmath124 is actually the unabsorbed intrinsic spectrum , for example , the red curves shown in top panels of figure [ f3 ] for balmer lines . for each set of parameters ( @xmath126 , @xmath127 and @xmath128 ) , we calculated all possible combinations of individual models , and selected the one with minimized @xmath100 which is plotted in panel ( a ) and ( b ) of figure [ f5 ] ( green curves ) . we derived physical parameters @xmath9 , @xmath8 and @xmath129 for balmer bals . the green curves represent the model profiles of h@xmath53 and h@xmath0 absorption which match well to the observed spectra . meanwhile , we also plotted the model absorption trough of @xmath130 in panel ( c ) of figure [ f5 ] . the model absorption trough of @xmath130 bal is consistent with observation . note that , @xmath124 in the @xmath13110830 region is the blue curve shown in panel ( a ) of figure [ f4 ] , and the modeled @xmath125 should be added with the black - body emission component ( orange dashed line in figure [ f4 ] ) in the comparison of the model spectrum with observation . we further explored the various absorption and doublets in the sdss spectrum . here , the comparison spectrum of sdss j082806.18 + 063608.3 was used to represent the unabsorbed intrinsic spectrum . the observed spectrum ( black curve ) , and modeled spectrum with absorption ( green curve ) for 1523  are plotted in panel ( a ) of figure [ f6 ] . it can be seen that the modeled spectrum with absorption is in good agreement with the observed one at the red wing of and the longer wavelengths . the normalized fluxes at wavelength longger than 2800    are around 1 . that means that the absorption multiplets of opt.6,7 and opt.8 observed in 1523 can be largely recovered using the above modeled absorption . however , the match of opt.6,7 and opt.8 between model and observation is still fluky . 1523  is observed to decrease in flux on the timescale of 8.99 years from the fbqs to the sdss , but the absorption of opt.6,7 and opt.8 changes weakly , and the dramatic absorption variabilities are uv 1 , uv 62 and . a photoionization model with lower density ( @xmath132 ) and ionization parameter ( @xmath133 ) than the above can approximatively match the absorption variations ( see figure 2 of zhang et al . 2015b ) .    for the sdss blue - side spectrum , there seems to be other absorption components for uv 1 , uv 62 and , corresponding to outflow materials with low density . indeed , the comparison of 1523 and the two templates in panel ( b ) of figure [ f2 ] suggests the existence of the other absorption components . opt.6,7 and opt.8 have similar absorption depth as the balmer absorption troughs , while the troughs of uv 1 are nearly twice as deep as opt.6,7 and opt.8 multiplets . moreover , the residual fluxes of uv 62 and bal troughs are even only one - third of opt.6,7 and opt.8 troughs . we broadened a low density model ( @xmath9 , @xmath134 and @xmath129 ) with a single gaussian profile and blueshifted it to approximatively model the residual component shown in panel ( b ) of figure [ f6 ] . the fwhm of gaussian profile is 3000 km  s@xmath4and the blueshifted velocity is 14,000 km  s@xmath4 . if we use a uniform covering factor for this component , @xmath135 is found to be @xmath136 . we also noticed that the residual absorption spectrum indicate stronger absorption of uv144 - 149 and uv158 - 164 multiplets ( around 2400  ) than the optical model ( panel ( b ) of figure [ f2 ] ) , which most likely suggests a higher density or some microturbulence in the outflow winds ( shi et al . in pre . ) .      from the spectral fittings in section 3.1 , we can obtain the continuum and emission line parameters , and derive the quasar fundamental parameters . the measured monochromatic luminosity at 5100   in the rest frame is @xmath137 erg s@xmath15 . the bolometric luminosity @xmath138 is estimated from the luminosity @xmath139 with a bolometric correction of 9 ( kaspi et al . 2000 ) . the full width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of broad balmer emission lines is 1744 km  s@xmath4 , and then the bh mass @xmath140 m@xmath141 , is estimated using the following prescription based on the luminosity at 5100  and the width of h@xmath53 emission ( vestergaard & peterson 2006 ) : @xmath142   + ( 6.91 \pm 0.02 ) . \label{mbh}\ ] ] the corresponding eddington ratio is @xmath143 , @xmath144 . the black hole mass computing formula of mclure & dunlop ( 2004 ) give the similar results , @xmath145 m@xmath141 and @xmath146 . 1523 is a typical narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxy ( nls1 ) with a low black hole mass but high accretion ratio . the radius of broad emission line regions ( belrs ) , @xmath147 , can be estimated using the formula based on the luminosity at 5100 , @xmath148 where the parameters , @xmath0 and @xmath53 are @xmath149 and @xmath150 given in greene & ho ( 2005 ) and @xmath151 and @xmath152 given in kaspi et al . ( 2005 ) respectively . thus , the luminosity yields @xmath153 pc . the radius of the dust torus , @xmath154 , can also be estimated based on the thermal equilibrium of the inner side of the torus as @xmath155 where @xmath156 is the stefan - boltzmann constant , @xmath157 is the temperature of inner side of the tours . then , we get @xmath158 pc . ionization parameter is defined as : @xmath159 in which , @xmath160 is the frequency corresponding the hydrogen edge , and @xmath161 is the ionization photons emission rate . using above ionization equation and the inferred @xmath161 , @xmath126 and @xmath127 values , one can get the distance of the absorption gas of balmer bals from central ionization source , @xmath162 pc . thus , the high density outflow gas of balmer bals locates at or outside of the belrs , and less than the distance of the dust torus . similarly , the estimated distance of the low density outflow gas is much farther than the outflow materials with high density , reacheing several tens of parsecs . ccc cccc ngc 4151 & @xmath163 & @xmath164350 & & & hutchings et al .

( 2014 ) , we know that outflow velocity strongly or moderately depends on the eddington ratio , luminosity , uv and nir slopes ( also see hamann 1998 ; misawa et al . 2007 ; ganguly et al . the first three items represent the ionization sed and the amount of the high - energy photons , and the last item is the possible contribution of the dust to the outflow acceleration . 1523 is a high - luminous nls1 with near - eddington accretion rate . meanwhile , the nir slope of 1523 is @xmath179 , which is redder than those of most bal quasars ( see figure 2 in zhang et al . these statistical properties bring about the occurrence of the high - velocity outflow .    from table [ tab3 ] , we knew that only three of literature quasars are the balmer bals , and others are just the balmer nals . indeed , the absorption troughs of balmer and @xmath120 series can help us to straighten out the classification of bals . for example , there are suspected overlapping absorption features of in two objects , hall et al . ( 2002 ) classified them into a special absorption subtype , the so - called many - narrow - trough felobal ( mntfelobal ) . however , the troughs of balmer and @xmath120 series present the true absorption profiles with narrow widths , and these profiles are used to model absorption multiplets ( shi et al . in pre . ) . the cloudy simulations provided the physical conditions of outflow gases for part of objects listed in table [ tab3 ] . it can be seen that almost all absorption lines are constrained to come from high density gases ( @xmath180 ) , and 1523 is among sources with the highest density except sdss j112526.12 + 002901.3 . the high density suggests that the outflow winds should survive in the inner region of the agn . the photoionization model gave an estimation of a distance of @xmath181 pc . the outflow winds in 1523 locate at such close from the central ionizing source which is slightly farther than that of belrs . in the disk wind scenarios ( murray et al . 1995 ) , most photoionized clouds emerge from the accretion disk and accelerate outwards . the velocities of the clouds are assumed to be a function of the initial velocities , the terminal velocities and the radii that they are away from the center . the terminal velocities are approximately inversely proportional to the square root of the radius at which the streamlines . thus the innermost streamlines have the highest rotational and terminal radial velocities and highest ionization states . balmer absorption winds in 1523  are just located at the distance of @xmath181 pc from the central ionizing source . we suggest that is the reason why balmer bals in this objetc have very large outflow velocities . panel ( c ) of figure [ f2 ] shows that the minimum velocity of the bal troughs is @xmath182 km  s@xmath4 , that means the absorption winds have large initial velocities when they emerge , or they have been accelerated from ( inside ) the belrs . if the mass flux is continuous , the optical depths decrease as a function of the blueshifted velocity . if the outflow is gathering speed , it seems that the volumes of absorption winds expand gradually during acceleration outwards . that is consistent with the existence of the excess outflow component of uv 62 and bal troughs ( figure [ f6 ] ) . this component shows higher blueshifted velocity ( @xmath183 km  s@xmath4 ) , larger covering factor ( @xmath184 ) and lower density ( @xmath185 ) , and is estimated to exist in remoter regions ( several tens of parsecs ) . in this work , we present the discovery of balmer - series absorption lines from h@xmath0 , h@xmath53 and h@xmath1 in 1523 from the quasi - simultaneous optical and near - infrared spectroscopy . the redshift of the balmer absorption troughs is @xmath186 , and it is blueshifted by @xmath187 km  s@xmath4with regard to the balmer emission lines . balmer bals have outflowing velocities a factor of two than the previously known balmer absorption lines . we searched for the same velocity components seen in other nir balmer absorption lines . we found a component in the @xmath130 absorption line at the same redshift . the absorption trough in @xmath130 has a uniform absorption profile with the balmer - series , with the absorption width @xmath188 km  s@xmath4 . therefore 1523 is the object with the broadest balmer absorption lines detected so far . we measured the profiles of balmer bels and derived their widths of @xmath189 km  s@xmath4 . the estimation of the fundamental parameters shows that 1523 is a typical nls1 with a low black hole mass but high accretion ratio . we approximately evaluate the bals by employing the cloudy in a extensive parameter space . the outflow winds of balmer bals are suggested to be of the electron density of @xmath190 , an ionization parameter of @xmath191 , and the distance of @xmath181 pc from the central ionizing source which is slightly farther than that of belrs . many thanks to the anonymous referee for the helpful suggestions . many thanks to dr . huiyuan wang and dr . xueguang zhang for very helpful discussions . this work is supported by chinese natural science foundation ( nsfc-11203021 , 11573024 ) , national basic research program of china ( `` 973 '' program , 2013cb834905 ) the soc program ( chinare-2015 -

The quasar is characterized by its high luminosity, broad absorption lines, and strong outflow of gas. The absorption lines are detected in the optical and near-infrared parts of the spectrum, and the outflow velocity is found to be high, indicating a strong and fast outflow of gas from the central region of the quasar.

The","we present the discovery of balmer line absorption from h@xmath0 to h@xmath1 in an iron low - ionization broad absorption line ( felobal ) quasar sdss j152350.42 + 391405.2 ( hereafter 1523 ) , by the quasi - simultaneous optical and near - infrared spectroscopy . 
 the balmer line absorption is at @xmath2 and blueshifted by @xmath3 km  s@xmath4with respect to the balmer emission lines . 
 all balmer bals have uniform absorption profile with the widths of @xmath512,000 km  s@xmath4 . 
 we also found the absorption trough in * @xmath610830 with the same velocity and width in the @xmath7-band triplespec spectrum of 1523 . 
 this object is only the tenth active galactic nucleus known to exhibit non - stellar balmer absorption , and also the case with the highest velocity and broadest balmer absorption lines which have ever been found . 
 a cloudy analysis shows that the absorbers require an gas density of @xmath8 and an ionization parameter of @xmath9 . 
 they locate at a distance of @xmath10 pc from the central ionizing source which is slightly farther than that of belrs . furthermore 
 , 1523 is one of the brightest balmer - bal quasar ever reported , with unique iron absorption variations , making it as the most promising candidate for follow up high - resolution spectroscopy , multi - band observations , and long - term monitoring .",47222,438,1355,53.36 seconds,8.05 MB,0.35789473684210527,0.11307420494699649,0.2175438596491228,0.8200525045394897,medium

"a recent influx of academic monographs @xcite and popular books @xcite manifests a keen cultural and scientific interest in complex networks , which appeal to both applied and theoretical problems in national defense , sociology , epidemiology , computer science , statistics , and mathematics . the erds  rnyi random graph @xcite remains the most widely studied network model . its simple dynamics endow it with remarkable mathematical properties , but this simplicity overpowers any ability to replicate realistic structure . many other network models have been inspired by empirical observations . chief among these is the _ scale - free _ phenomenon , which has garnered attention since the initial observation of power law behavior for internet statistics @xcite . celebrated is barabsi and albert s preferential attachment model @xcite , whose dynamics are tied to the _ rich get richer _ or _ matthew effect_. citing overlooked attributes of network sampling schemes , other authors @xcite have questioned the power law s apparent ubiquity . otherwise , watts and strogatz @xcite proposed a model that replicates milgram s _ small - world _ phenomenon @xcite , the vernacular notion of _ six degrees of separation _ in social networks . networks arising in many practical settings are dynamic , they change with time . consider a population @xmath0 of individuals . for each @xmath1 , let @xmath2 indicate a social relationship between @xmath3 and @xmath4 and let @xmath5 comprise the indicators for the whole population at time @xmath6 . for example , @xmath2 can indicate whether @xmath3 and @xmath4 are co - workers , friends , or family , have communicated by phone , email , or telegraph within the last week , month , or year , or subscribe to the same religious , political , or philosophical ideology . within the narrow scope of social networks , the potential meanings of @xmath2 seem endless ; expanding to other disciplines , the possible interpretations grow . in sociology , @xmath7 records changes of social relationships in a population ; in other fields , the network dynamics reflect different phenomena and , therefore , can exhibit vastly different behaviors . in each case , @xmath7 is a time - varying network . time - varying network models have been proposed previously in the applied statistics literature . the _ temporal exponential random graph model _ ( tergm ) in @xcite incorporates temporal dependence into the _ exponential random graph model _ ( ergm ) . the authors highlight select properties of the tergm , but consistency under subsampling is not among them . from the connection between sampling consistency and lack of interference , it is no surprise that the exponential random graph model is sampling consistent only under a choking restriction on its sufficient statistics @xcite . mccullagh @xcite argues unequivocally the importance of consistency for statistical models . presently , no network model both meets these logical requirements and reflects empirical observations . in this paper , rather than focus on a particular application , we discuss network modeling from first principles . we model time - varying networks by stochastic processes with a few natural invariance properties , specifically , exchangeable , consistent markov processes . the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ section : modeling preliminaries ] , we discuss first principles for modeling time - varying networks ; in section  [ section : informal description ] , we describe the rewiring process informally ; in section  [ section : rewiring maps ] , we introduce the workhorse of the paper , the rewiring maps ; in sections  [ section : discrete ] and [ section : exchangeable rewiring maps ] , we discuss a family of time - varying network models in discrete - time ; in section  [ section : continuous ] , we extend to continuous - time ; in section  [ section : poissonian structure ] , we show a poisson point process construction for the rewiring process , and we use this technique to establish the feller property ; and in section  [ section : concluding remarks ] , we make some concluding remarks . we prove some technical lemmas and theorems in section  [ section : proof ] . for now , we operate with the usual definition of a graph / network as a pair @xmath8 of vertices and edges . we delay formalities until they are needed . let @xmath9 be a random collection of graphs indexed by @xmath10 , denoting _ time_. we may think of @xmath11 as a collection of social networks ( for the same population ) that changes as a result of social forces , for example , geographical relocation , broken relationships , new relationships , etc . , but our discussion generalizes to other applications .    in practice , we can observe only a finite sample of individuals . since the population size is often unknown , we assume an infinite population so that our model only depends on known quantities . thus , each @xmath12 is a graph with infinitely many vertices , of which we observe a finite sub - network @xmath13}_t$ ] with @xmath14 vertices . since the vertex labels play no role , we always assume sampled graphs have vertex set @xmath15:=\{1,\ldots , n\}$ ] , where @xmath16 is the sample size , and the population graph is infinite with vertex set @xmath17 , the natural numbers . the models we consider are _ markovian _ , _ exchangeable _ , and _ consistent_.      the process @xmath11 has the _ markov property _ if , for every @xmath18 , its pre-@xmath6 and post-@xmath6 @xmath19-fields are conditionally independent given the present state @xmath12 . put another way , the current state @xmath12 incorporates all past and present information about the process , and so the future evolution depends on @xmath20 only through @xmath12 . it is easy to conceive of counterarguments to this assumption : in a social network , suppose there is no edge between individuals @xmath21 and @xmath22 or between @xmath23 and @xmath24 at time @xmath18 . then , informally , and @xmath25 for the sake of illustration . ] we expect the future ( marginal ) evolution of edges @xmath26 and @xmath25 to be identically distributed . but if , in the past , @xmath21 and @xmath22 have been frequently connected and @xmath23 and @xmath24 have not , we might infer that the latent relationships among these individuals are different and , thus , their corresponding edges should evolve differently . for instance , given their past behavior , we might expect that @xmath21 and @xmath22 are more likely than @xmath23 and @xmath24 to reconnect in the future .    despite such counterarguments , the markov property is widely used and works well in practice . generalizations to the markov property may be appropriate for specific applications , but they run the risk of overfitting .      structure and changes to structure drive our study of networks . vertex labels carry no substantive meaning other than to keep track of this structure over time ; thus , a suitable model is _ exchangeable _ , that is , its distributions are invariant under relabeling of the vertices .    for a model on finite networks ( i.e. , finitely many vertices ) , exchangeability can be induced trivially by averaging uniformly over all permutations of the vertices . but we assume an infinite population , for which the appropriate invariance is _ infinite exchangeability _ , the combination of exchangeability and consistency under subsampling ( section  [ section : consistency ] ) . unlike the finite setting , infinite exchangeability can not be imposed arbitrarily by averaging ; it must be an inherent feature of the model .      for any graph with vertex set @xmath27 , there is a natural and obvious restriction to an induced subgraph with vertex set @xmath28 by removing all vertices and edges that are not fully contained in @xmath29 . the assumption of _ markovian consistency _ , or simply _ consistency _ , for a graph - valued markov process implies that , for every @xmath30 , the restriction @xmath31}$ ] of @xmath11 to the space of graphs with vertex set @xmath15 $ ] is , itself , a markov process . note that this property does not follow immediately from the markov assumption for @xmath11 because the restriction operation is a many - to - one function and , in general , a function of a markov process need not be markov . also note that the behavior of the restriction @xmath31}$ ] can depend on @xmath11 through as much as its exchangeable @xmath32-field , which depends only on the `` tail '' of the process . markovian consistency may be unjustified in some network modeling applications . this contrasts with other combinatorial stochastic process models , for example , coalescent processes @xcite , for which consistency is induced by an inherent _ lack of interference _ in the underlying scientific phenomena . nevertheless , if we assume the network is a sample from a larger network , then consistency permits out - of - sample statistical inference @xcite . without markovian consistency in a time - varying markov model , the sampled process can depend on the whole ( unobserved ) process , leaving little hope for meaningful inference . we can envision at least two kinds of network dynamics that correspond , intuitively , to _ local _ and _ global _ structural changes . local changes involve _ only one _ edge , global changes involve a _ positive fraction _ of edges . we say the _ status _ of edge @xmath33 is _ on _ if there is an edge between @xmath21 and @xmath23 ; otherwise , we say the status is _ off_.    a local change occurs whenever the status of exactly one edge changes , called a _ single - edge update_. an easy way to generate single - edge updates is by superposition of independent rate-1 poisson processes . for each pair @xmath34 , we let @xmath35 be the arrival times of a rate-1 poisson point process . at each arrival time , the status of the edge between @xmath21 and @xmath23 changes ( either from ` off ' to ` on ' or the reverse ) . doing this independently for each pair results in an infinite number of changes to the network in any arbitrary time interval , but only finitely many changes within each finite subnetwork . we call a process with this description a _ local - edge process _ ; see section  [ section : local - edge ] . a global change occurs whenever the status of a positive proportion of edges changes simultaneously . in practice , such an event might indicate a major external disturbance within the population , for example , spread or fear of a pandemic . modeling such processes in continuous - time requires more preparation than the local - edge process .    for an example , consider generating a discrete - time markov chain @xmath36 on the finite space of graphs with vertex set @xmath15 $ ] . at any time @xmath37 , given @xmath38 , we can generate a transition to a new state @xmath39 as follows . independently for each pair @xmath34 , we flip a coin to determine whether to put an edge between @xmath21 and @xmath23 in @xmath39 : if @xmath33 is _ on _ in @xmath40 , we flip a @xmath41-coin ; otherwise , we flip a @xmath42-coin . this description results in a simple , exchangeable markov chain on finite graphs , which we call the _ erds  rnyi rewiring chain _ ( section  [ section : er ] ) . more general transitions are possible , for example , edges need not evolve independently . we use the next markov chain as a running example of a discrete - time rewiring chain . we fix @xmath30 and regard an undirected graph @xmath40 with vertex set @xmath15 $ ] as a @xmath43-valued symmetric matrix @xmath44 such that @xmath45 for all @xmath46 ; that is , we represent a graph by its adjacency matrix with @xmath47 . for any pair of graphs @xmath48 , we can compute the statistic @xmath49 , where for @xmath50 , @xmath51 for example , @xmath52 is the number of pairs @xmath53 for which the status of @xmath33 changes from @xmath54 to @xmath55 from @xmath40 to @xmath39 . we use @xmath56 as a sufficient statistic to define the transition probability @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 . the sufficient statistic @xmath56 is invariant under joint relabeling of the vertices of @xmath48 and so the transition law is exchangeable . furthermore , @xmath60 is reversible with respect to @xmath61 where @xmath62 , @xmath63 . the distribution @xmath64 arises as a mixture of erds  rnyi random graphs with respect to the @xmath65 distribution . furthermore , @xmath66 is a consistent collection of transition probabilities and , therefore , determines a unique transition probability ( and hence markov chain ) on the space of infinite graphs with vertex set @xmath67 . though consistency is not immediately obvious for the above family , the savvy reader might anticipate it : the formula for @xmath68 involves rising factorials ( i.e. , gamma functions ) , which also appear in other consistent combinatorial stochastic processes , for example , the chinese restaurant process @xcite and the beta - splitting model for fragmentation trees @xcite . we need not prove consistency explicitly for this model ; it follows from our more general construction of rewiring processes , all of which are consistent ( theorem  [ thm : consistent rewiring chain ] ) . we discuss the above family further in section  [ section : er ] .      throughout the paper , we construct exchangeable and consistent markov processes using a special _ rewiring measure _ ( section  [ section : exchangeable rewiring maps ] ) . in continuous - time , markov processes can admit infinitely many jumps in arbitrarily small time intervals ; however , by the consistency assumption , any edge can change only finitely often in bounded intervals . in this case , we can choose a @xmath19-finite rewiring measure to direct the process . for @xmath14 , an ( undirected ) _ graph _ @xmath40 with vertex set @xmath15 $ ] can be represented by its symmetric _ adjacency matrix _ @xmath44 for which @xmath69 if @xmath40 has an edge between @xmath21 and @xmath23 , and @xmath70 otherwise . by convention , we always assume @xmath45 for all @xmath71 . we write @xmath72 to denote the finite collection of all graphs with vertex set @xmath15 $ ] .    on @xmath73 , we define the following operation of _ rewiring_. let @xmath74 be an @xmath75 symmetric matrix with entries in @xmath76 and all diagonal entries @xmath77 . for convenience , we write each entry of @xmath78 as a pair @xmath79 , @xmath80 . we define a map @xmath81 by @xmath82 , where @xmath83 more compactly , we may write @xmath84 . we call @xmath78 a _ rewiring map _ and @xmath85 the _ rewiring _ of @xmath40 by @xmath78 . we write @xmath86 to denote the collection of all rewiring maps @xmath87 , which are in one - to - one correspondence with @xmath75 symmetric matrices with entries in @xmath76 and all diagonal entries @xmath77 . the following display illustrates the rewiring operation in ( [ eq : rewire ] ) . given @xmath88 and @xmath89 , we obtain @xmath85 by choosing the appropriate element of each entry of @xmath78 : if @xmath70 , we choose the _ left _ coordinate of @xmath90 ; if @xmath69 , we choose the _ right _ coordinate of @xmath90 . for example , @xmath91    a unique symmetric @xmath75 matrix determines each element in @xmath72 and @xmath92 , and so there is a natural restriction operation on both spaces by taking the leading @xmath93 submatrix , for any @xmath94 . in particular , we write @xmath95}:= ( g_{ij})_{1\leq i , j\leq m},\quad\quad g \in \mathcal{g}_n , \quad\mbox{and}\nonumber \\[-8pt]\\[-8pt ] w|_{[m]}&:=&(w_{ij})_{1\leq i , j\leq m},\quad\quad w\in \mathcal { w}_n , \nonumber\end{aligned}\ ] ] to denote the restrictions of @xmath96 and @xmath97 to @xmath98 and @xmath99 , respectively . these restriction operations lead to the notions of _ infinite graphs _ and _ infinite rewiring maps _ as infinite symmetric arrays with entries in the appropriate space , either @xmath43 or @xmath100 . we write @xmath101 to denote the space of infinite graphs , identified by a @xmath43-valued _ adjacency array _ , and @xmath102 to denote the space of infinite rewiring maps , identified by a symmetric @xmath76-valued array with @xmath77 on the diagonal . any @xmath103 acts on @xmath101 just as in ( [ eq : rewire ] ) and , for any @xmath104 , the rewiring operation satisfies @xmath105}=w|_{[n]}(g|_{[n ] } ) \quad\quad\mbox{for all } n\in \mathbb{n}.\ ] ]    the spaces @xmath101 and @xmath102 are uncountable but can be equipped with the discrete @xmath19-algebras @xmath106 and @xmath107 , respectively , so that the restriction maps @xmath108}$ ] are measurable for every @xmath109 . moreover , both @xmath101 and @xmath102 come equipped with a product - discrete topology induced , for example , by the ultrametric @xmath110}=w'|_{[n]}\bigr\},\quad\quad w , w'\in \wiren.\ ] ] the metric on @xmath101 is analogous . both @xmath101 and @xmath102 are compact , complete , and separable metric spaces . much of our development hinges on the following proposition , whose proof is straightforward .

@xmath200 . by consistency of the transition probabilities @xmath201 ( theorem  [ thm : consistent rewiring chain ] ) , the finite - dimensional stationary measures @xmath202 must be exchangeable and

"the alloy theoretic automated toolkit ( atat ) avdw : atat , avdw : maps , avdw : emc2 is a suite of software tools facilitating the determination of thermodynamic properties of solid state alloys from first - principles calculations . it relies upon the cluster expansion formalism sanchez : cexp , ducastelle : book , fontaine : clusapp , zunger : nato , zunger : scord , wolverton : srorev , ceder : oxides , asta : fppheq to build a simplified effective hamiltonian that accurately reproduces quantum mechanical calculation results for an alloy system of interest and that can be used to efficiently calculate their thermodynamic properties . atat is freely distributed and open - source , thus encouraging users to contribute @xcite . atat s basic functionalities have been described in an earlier issue of the calphad journal @xcite . since then , a number of new features have been added and the purpose of the present paper is to describe these additions and provide a concise user guide  for these new features . the most significant additions to atat are    1 . extensions to multicomponent multisublattice systems ; 2 .   the inclusion of nonconfigurational sources of entropy ( vibrational and electronic entropy ) ; 3 .   special quasirandom structures ( sqs ) generation ; 4 .   tensorial cluster expansion construction ; 5 .   support for multiple atomistic ( ab initio ) codes ; 6 . various new conversion and analysis utilities . the features presented here are not exhaustive and new features are continuously being added . hence , the reader is invited to consult the manual supplied with the atat distribution or posted on the atat web site ( ` http://alum.mit.edu/www/avdw/atat ` ) for the most up to date information . the traditional _ cluster expansion _ represents the relationship @xmath0 between a _ configuration _ @xmath1  and some scalar intensive quantity @xmath2 . while multicomponent alloys have been covered since the original introduction of the cluster expansion @xcite , handling multisublattice systems ( in which different sites in the unit cell can host different binary sets of atoms ) is a more recent extension @xcite . atat implements a superset of these two formalisms , allowing different sites to host an arbitrary ( and potentially different ) number of elements , some of which may be common across sublattices . these sublattices may or may not consist of sets of symmetrically equivalent sites .  to fix the ideas , refer to table [ tablat ] for an example exploiting all of these extensions . the multicomponent multisublattice features of atat have been used , for instance , in avdw : smceo2,ghosh : alznti , shin : ternsqs . .[tablat ] example of a lattice , based on the martensite system , written in atat s `` lattice input file '' format . [ cols= "" < , < "" , ]    + this way of specifying composition was selected because it allows the user to individually control the composition on each sublattice . 3 .   select a small number of correlations to match exactly and compute their value in the disordered state:`corrdump -noe -rnd -s = conc.in -2=[pair max radius ] 3=[triplet max radius ] > tcorr.out`this command writes the nonempty ( ` -noe ` ) correlations of the disordered state ( ` -rnd ` ) having the same composition as the structure ` conc.in ` into the file ` tcorr.out ` . pair correlations up to distance ` [ pair max radius ] ` and triplet correlations up to ` [ pair triplet radius ] ` are considered ( larger clusters can also be specified with ` -4=  ` , etc . ) . this command also writes a cluster file ` clusters.out ` that will be read in the step . the sqs generation step is initiated with , for instance,`gensqs -n=16 > sqs16.out`which generates 16-atom sqs and puts them into the ` sqs16.out ` file . if this file is empty , the range of correlations to be matched exactly needs to be reduced in step 3 . a word of caution : ` gensqs ` only generates structures containing exactly the number of atoms per unit cell specified by the ` -n ` option ( i.e. , if an sqs with a smaller unit cell exists , it will not be listed ) . the output file ` sqs16.out ` may contain a large number of candidate sqs . while these a match the specified criteria , they may differ in quality in terms of the correlations not included in the screening process . further screening can be performed with the command`corrdump -2=[another radius ] -3=[another radius ] -4=[another radius ] -noe -s = sqs16.out`which will output the correlations of all sqs in ` sqs16.out ` . clearly , the radii specified should be larger than in step 3 in order to distinguish and rank these sqs . while there are no formal rules to decide whether it is preferable to match more pairs or more multi - body correlations , general guidelines can be given . in general , it would be unusual to match longer range @xmath3-body correlations than @xmath4-body interactions if @xmath5 . in systems exhibiting large relaxations ( due to large atomic size mismatches ) , multi - body correlations are expected be important , while in ionic systems , pair interactions are expected to dominate . sqs generation via exhaustive enumeration is time - consuming . this can be alleviated by exploiting parallelism . multiple independent copies of ` gensqs ` can be run on separate processors if one specifies the ` -ip=[index ] ` and ` -tp=[number of processes ] ` options . the ` [ index ] ` runs from 0 to ` [ number of processes-1 ] ` and is used to tell each copy of ` gensqs ` which portion of the space to scan . for maximum efficiency , ` [ number of processes ] ` should be a factor of the total number of possible supercells , which can be determined , e.g. , with the ` gensqs -n=16 -pc ` command .    another way to improve sqs generation speed is via stochastic sampling abrikosov : sqsmc . such an approach seeks to quickly find close - to - optimal solutions rather than slowly finding an exact solution . another approach is to scan through configurations in such as way that only the desired composition is sampled , using atom permutations rather than atom transmutations . this scheme becomes increasingly advantageous as one moves away from equiatomic compositions . yi wang contributed a useful code implementing these two algorithms ( that were used in @xcite ) , which will be included in the atat distibution shortly . finally , we note that sqs prove useful in the construction of a cluster expansion as well . any generated sqs can be included into the set structures used to fit a cluster expansion as a way to ensure that the properties of the disordered state are properly reproduced . in practice , one can merely place the desired sqs into a ` str.out ` file within a subdirectory and run an ab initio code on it with ` runstruct_xxxx ` . the ` mmaps ` code will readily read in any user - specified structure placed in its directory hierarchy ( provided the ` lat.in ` files used in ` mmaps ` and ` gensqs ` are identical ) . while the formalism enabling the cluster expansion of tensors has been derived in @xcite , we provide here a brief explanation of how to use this feature . in section [ seccenc ] , it was shown how to cluster expand a scalar  the process is similar for tensors .    1 . create a ` lat.in ` providing the lattice and a ` gcetensor.in ` file describing the type of tensor in the form:`[rank]``[list of pairs of indices indicating which simultaneous index permutations leave the tensor invariant]``[next list , etc ... ]`to fix the ideas , here are a few examples . for strain or stress the ` gcetensor.in ` should be:`2``0 1 ` ( indicating that such tensor is symmetric , i.e. ,  @xmath6)while for elastic constants , it should be : ` 4 ` ` 0 1 ` ( indicating @xmath7 ) ` 2 3 ` ( indicating @xmath8 ) ` 0 2 1 3 ` ( indicating @xmath9 ) . 2 .   generate a list of clusters with the command`gce -clus -2=[max pair radius ] -3=[max triplet radius ] ` etc.note that ` gce ` ( which stands for generalized cluster expansion ) admits essentially the same syntax as ` corrdump ` in the scalar case . 3 .   calculate the property tensor associated with each structure . this is highly application - dependent . for instance , to calculate the static lattice strain , one could use ( assuming ab initio calculations have been run in each subdirectory):`foreachfile -e str_relax.out analrelax -d > strain`to calculate the elastic constants one could use:`foreachfile -e str_relax.out calcelas -d ` ( this generates perturbations)`pollmach -e runstruct_xxxx -w force.wrap ` ( this calculates the induced reaction stresses)`foreachfile -e str_relax.out calcelas -f > elas ` ( this fits the elastic tensor and writes it in the file ` elas ` . ) 4 .   finally , do the cluster expansion itself with:`clusterexpand -pa -g strain``clusterexpand -pa -g elas`the ` -g ` invokes the generalized cluster expansion option while the ` -pa ` indicates that the quantities to be expanded are intensive ( i.e. per atom ) . all interfaces have the general name ` runstruct_xxxx ` . currently , the following are supported : ` runstruct_vasp ` ( for the vasp code @xcite ) ` runstruct_abinit ` ( for the abinit @xcite  code ) , ` runstruct_gulp ` ( for the gulp code @xcite ) . in addition , monodeep chakraborty , jrgen spitaler , peter puschnig and claudia ambrosch - draxl have written an interface with ` wien2k ` @xcite , which will be publicly available shortly . finally , ` runstruct_pwscf ` ( for the pwscf code @xcite ) is under development . each interface  has the following characteristics in common :    1 . it reads the geometry of a structure from the ` str.out ` file in current directory , written in the atat format . if a ` str_hint.out ` file exists , it takes precedence over the ` str.out ` file . this is useful to provide educated  guesses of the relaxed geometry via external user - supplied codes . 2 .   it reads some code - specific parameters from a file called ` xxxx.wrap ` ( or specified with ` -w [ file ] ` ) located in the current directory or up to two levels above . this separation between the geometry and calculation parameter input files is essential to ensure that all the pieces of atat are fully interoperable . 3 .   it runs the appropriate ab initio or atomistic code . if an argument is given to the ` runstruct_xxxx ` this string is used as prefix to the ab initio command . this feature is used to run the appropriate code remotely without having to install atat on the compute nodes . 4 .   it writes the structure s energy in the file ` energy ` and the structure s relaxed geometry in ` str_relax.out ` . ( if no relaxations are allowed , then the unrelaxed geometry is written in ` str_relax.out ` . ) it writes the forces acting on all atoms in ` forces.out ` , the stress acting on the cell in ` stress.out ` and the electronic density of states in ` dos.out ` ( although these are not yet implemented in all ` runstruct_xxxx ` commands ) . if anything goes wrong with the calculations , a file called ` error ` is written . typically the ab initio codes are not called one run at the time but rather as a batch of many jobs . the ` pollmach ` command manages such pools of jobs . the basic principle is simple : if a file called ` wait ` exists in a subdirectory , ` pollmach ` will find it and run the command specified on the command line within that directory . for instance,`pollmach runstruct_xxxx`will repeatedly wait for a ` wait ` file to be found , delete it , and then run ` runstruct_xxxx ` with the corresponding directory . in a multiprocessor environment , ` pollmach ` can simultaneously dispatch different jobs to different processors . this simple mechanism allows most of the atat codes to be completely platform - independent , with ` pollmach ` being the only platform - dependent piece . the first time ` pollmach ` is run , default configurational files are set up and the user will be asked to tailor them to the local computing environment . the atat distribution includes many examples of setups , including the increasingly common case of a large pool of processors to be divided up into subgroup that each run a separate parallel version of an ab initio code . we now briefly mention some utilities to give users direct access to some of the inner algorithms of atat .    1 .   ` corrdump ` finds symmetry operations , enumerates clusters , calculates correlations ( including of the disordered state ) , etc . genstr ` enumerates superstructures of a given lattice . pdef ` generates substitutional point defect supercells . cellcvrt ` manipulates atat - formatted structure files , changing coordinate systems , converting fractional to cartesian coordinates , finding supercells and subcells , etc . lsfit ` implements least - squares fitting . nnshell ` finds nearest - neighbor shells . a number of text parsing utilities : ` getvalue ` , ` getlines ` , ` sspp ` . more information regarding these utilities can be found in their respective help files ( accessed by specifying the ` -h ` option ) . this completes this overview of the various new features added to atat in recent years . what s next ? probably :    1 .   a tighter integration between the output of the monte carlo code and thermodynamic databases for use with softwares such as thermocalc and pandat ; 2 .   material propery optimization modules exploiting the tensorial cluster expansion ; 3 . more automated ways to include nonconfigurational free energy ; 4 .   better electronic free energy calculators .    however , in large part , what will be next will depend on what users express interest in and what the author can get funding for this research was supported by the us national science foundation through teragrid resources provided by ncsa and sdsc under grant tg - dmr050013n . the nsf center for the science and engineering of materials at caltech supported the preparation of this manuscript . the author would like to thank    * mark asta for supporting this effort while the author was at northwestern . * gerd ceder for supporting this effort while the author was at mit . * yi wang , who has contributed an efficient sqs generator . * dongwong shin , who has contributed a list of useful lattices . * volker blum , who provided a nice perl remake of the load checking utility ` chl ` . * mayeul davezac , who fixed a number of tricky compilation problems and identified a few bugs . * gautam ghosh , who provided a utility to convert ` emc2 ` output files into a format suitable for the thermocalc s parrot module . he also suggested the inclusion of magnetic free energies based on ohnuma : empmag . * zhe liu for his contributions to generalize the stiffness vs. length approach to include composition - dependence . * monodeep chakraborty , jrgen spitaler , peter puschnig and claudia ambrosch - draxl , who are developing an interface with ` wien2k ` . * ben burton and raymundo arroyave , who helped debug the code and the documentation . * pratyush tiwary , who proofread this manual .    these faithful and patient users ( and many others ) have been crucial to help maintain and develop this toolkit . atat calculates the matrices @xmath10  and @xmath11 and vectors @xmath12 and @xmath13 in equations ( [ eqgivec ] ) and ( [ eqgivex ] ) as follows .    1 .   start enumerating all structures ( in order of increasing unit cell size ) while computing the point correlation vector @xmath14 for each of them . let @xmath15 denote the corresponding point correlation vector with a constant element appended to it . skip any structures whose @xmath15 is colinear with the @xmath15 of earlier structures . terminate this step when the number of structures kept is equal to the dimension of @xmath15 . 2 .   for each of the kept structures , calculate its full concentration vector @xmath16 . create a matrix @xmath17 by pasting the column vectors @xmath16 just obtained side by side . similar , create a matrix @xmath18 by pasting the column vectors @xmath15 previously obtained . note that @xmath18 is square and invertible by construction and calculate @xmath19 . 3 .   all columns of @xmath20 but the last provide @xmath11 while the last column of @xmath20 gives @xmath13 . 4 .   eliminating all colinear rows from @xmath11 gives @xmath10 while eliminating the corresponding elements of @xmath13 gives @xmath12 .

"compact binary star systems are likely to be an important source of gravitational waves for the broadband laser interferometric detectors now under construction  @xcite , as they are the best understood of the various types of postulated gravity wave sources in the detectable frequency band and their waves should carry a large amount of information . within our own galaxy , there are three known neutron star binaries whose orbits will decay completely under the influence of gravitational radiation reaction within less than one hubble time , and it is almost certain that there are many more as yet undiscovered . current estimates of the rate of neutron star / neutron star ( ns / ns ) binary coalescences  @xcite based on these ( very few ) known systems project an event rate of three per year within a distance of roughly 200 mpc ; and estimates based on the evolution of progenitor , main - sequence binaries suggest a distance of as small as roughly 70 mpc for three events per year . these distances correspond to a signal strength which is within the target sensitivities of the ligo and virgo interferometers  @xcite . however , to find the signals within the noisy ligo / virgo data will require a careful filtering of the interferometer outputs . because the predicted signal strengths lie so close to the level of the noise , it will be necessary to filter the interferometer data streams in order to detect the inspiral events against the background of spurious events generated by random noise . the gravitational waveform generated by an inspiraling compact binary has been calculated using a combination of post - newtonian and post - minkowskian expansions   to post@xmath9-newtonian order by the consortium of blanchet , damour , iyer , will , and wiseman  @xcite , and will be calculated to post@xmath10-newtonian order long before the ligo and virgo interferometers come on - line ( c.  2000 ) . because the functional form of the expected signal is so well - known , it is an ideal candidate for matched filtering , a venerable and widely known technique which is laid out in detail elsewhere  @xcite and briefly summarized here :    the matched filtering strategy is to compute a cross - correlation between the interferometer output and a template waveform , weighted inversely by the noise spectrum of the detector . the signal - to - noise ratio is defined as the value of the cross - correlation of the template with a particular stretch of data divided by the rms value of the cross - correlation of the template with pure detector noise . if the signal - to - noise ratio exceeds a certain threshold , which is set primarily to control the rate of false alarms due to fluctuations of the noise , a detection is registered . if the functional form of the template is identical to that of the signal , the mean signal - to - noise ratio in the presence of a signal is the highest possible for any linear data processing technique , which is why matched filtering is also known as optimal filtering .    in practice , however , the template waveforms will differ somewhat from the signals . true gravitational - wave signals from inspiraling binaries will be exact solutions to the einstein equations for two bodies of non - negligible mass , while the templates used to search for these signals will be , at best , finite - order approximations to the exact solutions . also , true signals will be characterized by many parameters ( e.g. the masses of the two objects , their spins , the eccentricity and orientation of the orbit ... ) , some of which might be neglected in construction of the search templates . thus , the true signals will lie somewhat outside the submanifold formed by the search templates in the full manifold of all possible detector outputs ( see fig . [ fig : manifold ] ) . apostolatos  @xcite has defined the `` fitting factor '' @xmath11 to quantitatively describe the closeness of the true signals to the template manifold in terms of the reduction of the signal - to - noise ratio due to cross - correlating a signal lying outside the manifold with all the templates lying inside the manifold . if the fitting factor of a template family is unity , the signal lies in the template manifold . if the fitting factor is less than unity , the signal lies outside the manifold , and the fitting factor represents the cross - correlation between the signal and the template nearest it in the template manifold . even if the signal were to lie within the template manifold , it would not in general correspond to any of the actual templates used to search the data . the parameters describing the search templates ( masses , spins , etc . ) can vary continuously throughout a finite range of values . the set of templates characterized by the continuously varying parameters is of course infinite , so the interferometer output must be cross - correlated with a finite subset of the templates whose parameter values vary in discrete steps from one template to the next . this subset ( the `` discrete template family '' ) has measure zero on the manifold of the full set of possible templates ( the `` continuous template family '' ) , so the template which most closely matches a signal will generally lie in between members of the discrete template family ( again , see fig .  [ fig : manifold ] ) . the mismatch between the signal and the nearest of the discrete templates will cause some reduction in the signal - to - noise ratio and therefore in the observed event rate , as some signals which would lie above the threshold if cross - correlated with a perfectly matched filter are driven below the threshold by the mismatch . thus the spacing between members of the discrete template family must be chosen so as to render acceptable the loss in event rate , without requiring a prohibitive amount of computing power to numerically perform the cross - correlations of the data stream with all of the discrete templates . the high computational demands of a laser interferometric detector may in fact make it desirable to perform a _ hierarchical search_. in a hierarchical search , each stretch of data is first filtered by a set of templates which rather sparsely populates the manifold , and stretches which fail to exceed a relatively low signal - to - noise threshold are discarded . the surviving stretches of data are filtered by a larger set of templates which more densely populates the manifold , and are subjected to a higher threshold . the spareseness of the first - pass template set insures that most of the data need only be filtered by a small number of templates , while the high threshold of the final pass reduces the false alarm rate to an acceptable level . theoretical foundations for choosing the discrete set of templates from the continuous family were laid by sathyaprakash and dhurandhar for the case of white noise in ref .  , and for ( colored ) power - recycling interferometer noise in ref .  . both papers used a simplified ( so - called `` newtonian '' ) version of the waveform which can be characterized by a single parameter , the binary s `` chirp mass '' @xmath12 . recently , sathyaprakash  @xcite began consideration of an improved , `` post - newtonian '' set of templates characterized by two mass parameters . he found that , by a judicious choice of the two parameters , the spacing between templates can be made constant in both dimensions of the intrinsic parameter space . sathyaprakash s parameters also make it obvious ( by producing a very large spacing in one of the dimensions ) that a two - parameter set of templates can be constructed which , if it does not populate the manifold too densely , need not be much more numerous than the one - parameter set of templates used in refs .  .    in this paper i shall recast the s - d formalism in geometric language which , i believe , simplifies and clarifies the key ideas . i shall also generalize the s - d formalism to an arbitrary spectrum of detector noise and to a set of template shapes characterized by more than one parameter . this is necessary because , as apostolatos  @xcite has shown , no one - parameter set of templates can be used to filter a post - newtonian signal without causing an unacceptably large loss of signal - to - noise ratio .    in one respect , my analysis will be more specialized than that of the s - d formalism . my geometric analysis requires that the templates of the discrete set be spaced very finely in order that certain analytical approximations may be made , while the numerical methods of sathyaprakash and dhurandhar are valid even for a large spacing between templates ( as would be the case in the early stages of a hierarchical search ) . the small spacing approximation is justified on the grounds that at some point , even in a hierarchical search , the data must be filtered by many closely spaced templates in order to detect a reasonable fraction ( of order unity ) of the binary inspirals occurring in the universe within range of the ligo / virgo network . the rest of this paper is organized as follows : in sec . [ sec : formalism ] , i develop my generalized , geometric variant of the s - d formalism . i then apply this formalism to the general problem of detection of gravitational waves from inspiraling binaries , and develop general formulas for choosing a discrete template family from a given continuous template family . in sec . [ sec:1pn ] , i detail an example of the use of my formalism , choosing discrete templates from a continuous template family which describes nonspinning , circularized binaries to post@xmath1-newtonian order in the evolution of the waveform s phase . i also estimate the computing power required for a single - pass ( non - hierarchical ) search using this discrete template family , and compare to the previous work of sathyaprakash  @xcite . finally , in sec . [ sec : conclusion ] , i summarize my results and suggest future directions for research on the choice of discrete search templates . in this section , a geometric , multiparameter variant of the s - d formalism is developed . unless otherwise stated , the following conventions and definitions are assumed :    following cutler and flanagan  , we define the inner product between two functions of time @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( which may be templates or interferometer output ) as @xmath15 .\end{aligned}\ ] ] here @xmath16 is the fourier transform of @xmath13 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the detector s noise spectrum , defined below . the interferometer output @xmath19 consists of noise @xmath20 plus a signal @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is a dimensionless , time - independent amplitude and @xmath23 is normalized such that @xmath24 . thus , @xmath22 describes the strength of a signal and @xmath23 describes its shape . waveform templates are denoted by @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the vector of `` intrinsic '' or `` dynamical '' parameters characterizing the template shape and @xmath27 is the vector of `` extrinsic '' or `` kinematical '' parameters describing the offsets of the waveform s endpoint . examples of intrinsic parameters @xmath28 are the masses and spins of the two objects in a compact binary ; examples of extrinsic parameters @xmath29 are the time of a compact binary s final coalescence @xmath30 and the phase of the waveform at coalescence @xmath31 . templates are assumed to be normalized such that @xmath32 for all @xmath27 and @xmath26 . expectation values of various quantities over an infinite ensemble of realizations of the noise are denoted by @xmath33 $ ] . the interferometer s strain spectral noise density @xmath18 is the one - sided spectral density , defined by @xmath34 = \frac{1}{2}\delta ( f_1 - f_2 ) s_h(f_1)\ ] ] for positive frequencies and undefined for negative frequencies . the noise is assumed to have a gaussian probability distribution . newton s gravitational constant @xmath35 and the speed of light @xmath36 are set equal to one .      in developing our formalism , we begin by defining the signal - to - noise ratio . for any single template @xmath37 of unit norm , the cross - correlation with pure noise @xmath38 is a random variable with mean zero and variance unity ( cf . ii.b . of ref .  , wherein it is shown that @xmath39 = \langle a | b\rangle$ ] ) . the signal - to - noise ratio of a given stretch of data @xmath19 , after filtering by @xmath37 , is defined to be @xmath40 this ratio is the statistic which is compared to a predetermined threshold to decide if a signal is present .    if the template @xmath41 is the same as the signal @xmath42 , it optimally filters the signal , and the corresponding ( mean ) optimal signal - to - noise ratio is @xmath43 & = & { \rm e}[\langle n+{\cal a}u | u\rangle ] \nonumber \\ & = & { \cal a}.\end{aligned}\ ] ] if the template @xmath41 used to filter the data is not exactly the same as the signal @xmath42 , the mean signal - to - noise ratio is decreased somewhat from its optimal value : @xmath44 & = & { \rm e}[\langle n+{\cal a}s | u\rangle ] \nonumber \\ & = & { \cal a}\langle s | u\rangle.\end{aligned}\ ] ] the inner product @xmath45 , which is bounded between zero and one , is the fraction of the optimal @xmath46 $ ] retained in the mismatched filtering case , and as such is a logical measure of the effectiveness of the template @xmath41 in searching for the signal shape @xmath42 .    now suppose that we search for the signal with a family of templates specified by an extrinsic parameter vector @xmath27 and an intrinsic parameter vector @xmath26 . let us denote the values of the parameters of the actual templates by @xmath47 . for example , @xmath48 might be the value of the time @xmath30 of coalescence for the @xmath49th template in the family , and @xmath50 might be the phase of the @xmath49th template waveform at coalescence . the search entails computing , via fast fourier transforms ( fft s ) , all the inner products @xmath51 for @xmath52 in these numerical computations , the key distinction between the extrinsic parameters @xmath27 and the intrinsic parameters @xmath26 is this : one explores the whole range of values of @xmath27 very quickly , automatically , and efficiently for a fixed value of @xmath26 ; but one must do these explorations separately for each of the @xmath53 . in this sense , dealing with the extrinsic parameters is far easier and more automatic than dealing with the intrinsic ones .    as an example ( for further detail see sec . 16.2.2 of schutz  @xcite ) , for a given stretch of data one explores _ all _ values of the time of coalescence @xmath54 of a compact binary simultaneously ( for fixed values of the other template parameters ) via a single fft . if we write the fourier transform ( for notational simplicity ) as a continuous integral rather than a discrete sum , we get @xmath55 the discrete fft yields the discrete analog of the function of @xmath30 as shown above , an array of numbers containing the values of the fourier transform for all values of @xmath30 .    because , for fixed @xmath53 , the extrinsic parameters @xmath27 are dealt with so simply and quickly in the search , throughout this paper we shall focus primarily on a template family s intrinsic parameters @xmath26 , which govern the shape of the template . correspondingly , we shall adopt the following quantity as our measure of the effectiveness with which a particular template shape  i.e . a particular vector @xmath53 of the intrinsic parameters  matches the incoming signal : @xmath56{c}{\textstyle\max}\\{\scriptstyle\mu}\end{array } \langle s | u(\bbox{\mu},\bbox{\lambda}_{(k ) } ) \rangle .\ ] ] here the maximization is over all continuously varying values of the extrinsic parameters . then the logical measure of the effectiveness of the entire discrete family of templates in searching for the signal shape is @xmath57{c}{\textstyle\max}\\{\scriptstyle k}\end{array } \bigl [ \begin{array}[t]{c}{\textstyle\max}\\{\scriptstyle\mu}\end{array } \langle s | u(\bbox{\mu},\bbox{\lambda}_{(k ) } ) \rangle \bigr ] , \ ] ] which is simply  ( [ sort of match ] ) maximized over all the discrete template shapes .    in order to focus on the issue of discretization of the template parameters rather than on the inadequacy of the continuous template family , let us assume that the signal shape @xmath42 is identical to some template . the discussion of the preceding paragraphs suggests that in discussing the discretization of the template parameters we will want to make use of the _ match _ between two templates @xmath58 and @xmath59 which we will define as @xmath60{c}{\textstyle\max}\\{\scriptstyle\mu,\delta\mu}\end{array } \langle u(\bbox{\mu},\bbox{\lambda } ) | u(\bbox{\mu}+\delta\bbox{\mu},\bbox{\lambda}+\delta\bbox{\lambda } ) \rangle .\ ] ] this quantity , which is known in the theory of hypothesis testing as the _ ambiguity function , _ is the fraction of the optimal signal - to - noise ratio obtained by using a template with intrinsic parameters @xmath26 to filter a signal identical in shape to a template with intrinsic parameters @xmath61 .    using the match  ( [ match definition ] ) it is possible to quantify our intuitive notion of how `` close '' two template shapes are to each other . since the match clearly has a maximum value of unity at @xmath62 , we can expand in a power series about @xmath62 to obtain @xmath63 this suggests the definition of a metric @xmath64 so that the _ mismatch _ @xmath65 between two nearby templates is equal to the square of the proper distance between them : @xmath66    having defined a metric on the intrinsic parameter space , we can now use it to calculate the spacing of the discrete template family required to retain a given fraction of the ideal event rate . schematically , we can think of the templates as forming a lattice in the @xmath67-dimensional intrinsic parameter space whose unit cell is an @xmath67-dimensional hypercube with sides of proper length @xmath68 . the worst possible case ( lowest @xmath69 $ ] ) occurs if the point @xmath70 describing the signal is exactly in the middle of one of the hypercubes . if the templates are closely spaced , i.e.  @xmath71 , such a signal has a squared proper distance @xmath72 from the templates at the corners of the hypercube . we define the _ minimal match _ @xmath73 to be the match between the signal and the nearest templates in this worst possible case , i.e.  the fraction of the optimal signal - to - noise ratio retained by a discrete template family when the signal falls exactly `` in between '' the nearest templates . this minimal match is the same quantity that dhurandhar and sathyaprakash in ref . denote as @xmath74 ; but since it is the central quantity governing template spacing it deserves some recognition in the form of its own name . our choice of name closely parallels the term `` fitting factor '' @xmath11 , which apostolatos introduced in ref . @xcite to measure the similarity between actual signals and a continuous template family . the minimal match , which is chosen by the experimenter based upon what he or she considers to be an acceptable loss of ideal event rate , will determine our choice of spacing of the discrete template parameters and therefore the number of discrete templates in the family . more specifically , the experimenter will choose some desired value of the minimal match @xmath73 ; and then will achieve this @xmath73 by selecting the templates to reside at the corners of hypercubes with edge @xmath68 given by @xmath75 the number of templates in the resulting discrete template family will be the proper volume of parameter space divided by the proper volume per template @xmath76 , i.e. @xmath77      the formalism above applies to the detection of any set of signals which have a functional form that depends on a set of parameters which varies continuously over some range . we now develop a more explicit formula for the metric , given an analytical approximation to the ligo noise curve and a particular class of inspiraling binary signals . we approximate the `` initial '' and `` advanced '' benchmark ligo noise curves by the following analytical fit to fig . 7 of ref . @xcite : @xmath78\},&f > f_s\\ \infty,&f < f_s , \end{array } \right.\ ] ] where @xmath79 is the `` knee frequency '' or frequency at which the interferometer is most sensitive ( which is determined by the reflectivities of the mirrors and is set by the experimenters to the frequency where photon shot noise begins to dominate the spectrum ) and @xmath80 is a constant whose value is not important for our purposes . this spectrum describes photon shot noise in the `` standard recycling '' configuration of the interferometer ( second term ) superposed on thermal noise in the suspension of the test masses ( first term ) , and it approximates seismic noise by setting @xmath81 infinite at frequencies below the `` seismic - cutoff frequency '' @xmath82 .    throughout the rest of this paper , the `` first ligo noise curve '' will refer to ( [ ligo noise curve ] ) with @xmath82 = 40 hz and @xmath79 = 200 hz , and the `` advanced ligo noise curve '' will refer to ( [ ligo noise curve ] ) with @xmath82 = 10 hz and @xmath79 = 70 hz . these numbers are chosen to closely fit fig . 7 of ref . @xcite for the first ligo interferometers and for the advanced ligo benchmark . in this paper , when various quantities ( such as the number of discrete templates ) are given including a scaling with @xmath79 , this indicates how the quantity changes while @xmath79 is varied but @xmath83 is held fixed .    at this point it is useful to define the moments of the noise curve  ( [ ligo noise curve ] ) , following poisson and will  , as    [ moment definition ] @xmath84 the upper limit of integration @xmath85 denotes the coalescence frequency or high - frequency cutoff of whatever template we are dealing with , which very roughly corresponds to the last stable circular orbit of a test particle in a non - spinning black hole s schwarzschild geometry . for both first and advanced ligo noise curves , the majority of inspiraling binary search templates will occupy regions of parameter space for which @xmath85 is many times @xmath79 . because we will always be dealing with @xmath86 for @xmath87 , and because the noise term in the denominator of the integrand in eq . ( [ moment definition ] ) rises as @xmath88 for @xmath89 , we can simplify later calculations by approximating @xmath90 in the definition of the moments .    to illustrate the metric formalism , we shall use templates based on a somewhat simplified version of the post - newtonian expansion . since the inner product ( [ inner product definition ] ) has negligible contributions from frequencies at which the integrand oscillates rapidly , it is far more important to get the phase of @xmath91 right than it is to get the amplitude dependence . therefore , we adopt templates based on the `` restricted '' post - newtonian approximation in which one discards all multipolar components except the quadrupole , but keeps fairly accurate track of the quadrupole component s phase ( for more details see secs .  ii.c . and iii.a . of ref applying the stationary phase approximation to that quadrupolar waveform , we obtain @xmath92,\ ] ] up to a multiplicative constant which is set by the condition @xmath93 @xcite . the function @xmath94 , describing the phase evolution in ( [ template definition ] ) , is currently known to post@xmath9-newtonian order for the case of two nonspinning point masses in a circular orbit about each other as @xmath95 \end{array}\ ] ] ( cf . ( 3.6 ) of ref .  ) . here the mass parameters have been chosen to be @xmath96 , the total mass of the system , and @xmath97 , the ratio of the reduced mass to the total mass . the actual amplitude @xmath22 of a waveform is proportional to @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is the distance to the source ; and this lets us find the relation between minimal match and event rate which we will need in order to wisely choose the minimal match . assuming that compact binaries are uniformly distributed throughout space on large distance scales , this means that the rate of events with a given set of intrinsic parameters and with an amplitude greater than @xmath22 is proportional to @xmath100 . setting a signal - to - noise threshold @xmath101 is equivalent to setting a maximum distance @xmath102 to which sources with a given set of intrinsic parameters can be detected . thus , if we could search for signals with the entire continuous template family , we would expect the observed event rate to scale as @xmath103 . this ideal event rate is an upper limit on what we can expect with a real , discrete template family . we can obtain a lower bound on the observed event rate by considering what happens if all signals conspire to have parameters lying exactly in between the nearest search templates . in this case , all events will have reduced signal - to - noise ratios of @xmath73 times the optimal signal - to - noise ratio @xmath22 . this is naively equivalent to optimally filtering with a threshold of @xmath104 , so a pessimistic guess is @xmath105 for a fixed rate of false alarms .    in real life , @xmath101 is affected by the total number of discrete templates and by the minimal match of the discrete template family . this can be seen by the fact that the signal - to - noise ratio , @xmath106{c}{\textstyle\max}\\{\scriptstyle k}\end{array } \bigl [ \begin{array}[t]{c}{\textstyle\max}\\{\scriptstyle\mu}\end{array } \langle o | u(\bbox{\mu},\bbox{\lambda}_{(k ) } ) \rangle \bigr ] , \ ] ] is the maximum of a number of random variables . the covariance matrix of these variables will be determined by the minimal match , and will itself determine the probability distribution of @xmath107 ( in the absence of a signal ) which is used to set the threshold @xmath101 in order to keep the false alarm rate below a certain level . however , since these effects are fairly small at high signal - to - noise ratios ( such as those to be used by ligo ) and the issue of choosing thresholds is a problem worthy of its own paper @xcite , we will use ( [ er vs mm ] ) for the rest of this paper . for this two - parameter template family , the formula for the match ( [ match definition ] ) can be simplified somewhat by explicitly performing the maximization over the extrinsic parameters @xmath27 and @xmath108 . since the integrand in the inner product  ( [ inner product definition ] ) depends on @xmath27 and @xmath108 as @xmath109 $ ] , there is no dependence on @xmath27 but only on @xmath108 . maximizing over @xmath110 is easy : instead of taking the real part of the integral in the inner product ( [ inner product definition ] ) , we take the absolute value .    to maximize over @xmath111 we go back a step . let us define @xmath112 , and consider the @xmath113-dimensional space formed by @xmath114 and @xmath115 . we expand the inner product between adjacent templates to quadratic order in @xmath116 to get a preliminary metric @xmath117 , where the greek indices range from @xmath118 to @xmath67 ( latin indices range from @xmath119 to @xmath67 ) : @xmath120\right| } { \int_0^{\infty}df\frac{\displaystyle f^{-7/3}}{\displaystyle s_h(f)}}\right\ } \right ] { \atop\delta\lambda^\alpha = 0}.\ ] ] here @xmath121 @xcite . we define the moment functional @xmath122 such that , for a function @xmath123 , @xmath124 = \frac{1}{i(7)}\int_{f_s / f_0}^{f_c / f_0 } dx\frac{x^{-7/3}}{s_h(x~f_0)}a(x),\ ] ] and thus @xmath125 = \sum_n a_n j(7 - 3n).\ ] ] we also define the quantities @xmath126 such that @xmath127 where the derivative is evaluated at @xmath128 and @xmath129 is the part of @xmath94 in eq . ( [ template definition ] ) that is frequency dependent ( any non - frequency - dependent , additive parts of @xmath94 are removed when we take the absolute value in the maximized inner product ) . evaluation of the derivative in eq . ( [ premetric - def ] ) then shows that , in the limit @xmath130 , @xmath131 - { \cal j}[\psi_\alpha]{\cal j}[\psi_\beta]\right).\ ] ]    finally , we minimize @xmath132 with respect to @xmath111 ( i.e. , we project @xmath117 onto the subspace orthogonal to @xmath30 ) and thereby obtain the following expression for the metric of our continuous template family : @xmath133 by taking the square root of the determinant of this metric and plugging it into eq . ( [ cal n definition ] ) , we can compute the number of templates @xmath0 that we need in our discrete family as a function of our desired minimal match @xmath73 , or equivalently of the loss of ideal event rate . although the phase of the inspiraling binary signal has recently been calculated to post@xmath9-newtonian order  @xcite , it is useful to calculate the number of templates that would be required in a universe where the waveforms evolve only to post@xmath1-newtonian order and all binaries are composed of nonspinning objects in circular orbits . there are several reasons for this exercise .    1 . apostolatos  @xcite has shown that amplitude modulation of the waveform due to spin effects is important in an inspiraling binary search only for a few extremal combinations of parameters , and also that ( at higher post - newtonian order ) templates without spin - related phase modulation can match phase modulated signals almost as well as can templates that include spin parameters . therefore the bulk of the final set of templates actually used when the detectors come on - line will not need to include the extra spin parameters , and we may ignore them in this preliminary work . we assume circular orbits because gravitational radiation reaction circularizes most eccentric orbits on a timescale much less than the lifetime of a compact binary  @xcite . the phase of the templates is truncated at post@xmath1-newtonian order for simplicity . although apostolatos has demonstrated in ref . @xcite that post@xmath1-newtonian templates will not have a large enough fitting factor to be useful , consideration of such a set is a first step toward obtaining an adequate set of templates  and it is a particularly important step since the metric coefficients will turn out to be constant over the template manifold .      having chosen as the continuous template family the set of post@xmath1-newtonian , circular , spinless binary waveforms , we must now choose the discrete templates from within this continuous family . the first step is to calculate the coefficients of the metric on the two - dimensional dynamical parameter space . it is convenient to change the mass parameterization from the variables @xmath134 to the sathyaprakash variables  @xcite @xmath135 note that @xmath136 and @xmath137 are simply the newtonian and post@xmath1-newtonian contributions to the time it takes for the carrier gravitational wave frequency to evolve from @xmath79 to infinity . the advantage of these variables is that the metric coefficients in @xmath138 coordinates are constant ( in the limit @xmath139 ) for all templates . this is because the phase of the waveform @xmath91 is linear in the sathyaprakash variables , and so the integral in the definition of the match ( [ match definition ] ) depends only on the displacement @xmath140 between the templates , not on the location @xmath138 of the templates in the dynamical parameter space . the dynamical parameter - dependent part of the templates phase is given by [ eq . ( [ 2pn psi ] ) truncated to first post - newtonian order and reexpressed in terms of @xmath138 using eqs . ( [ def : tau1 ] ) and ( [ def : tau2 ] ) ] @xmath141 and it is easy to read off @xmath142 and @xmath143 [ eq . ( [ psi - def ] ) ] as the coefficients of @xmath136 and @xmath137 @xcite . by inserting these @xmath144 into eq . ( [ series functional ] ) , the relevant moment functionals can be expressed in terms of the moments of the noise : @xmath145 & = & 2\pi f_0~j(4 ) , \\ { \cal j}[\psi_1 ] & = & 2\pi f_0~\frac{3}{5}j(12 ) , \\ { \cal j}[\psi_2 ] & = & 2\pi f_0~j(10 ) , \\ { \cal j}[\psi_0 ^ 2 ] & = & ( 2\pi f_0)^2~j(1 ) , \\ { \cal j}[\psi_0\psi_1 ] & = & ( 2\pi f_0)^2~\frac{3}{5}j(9 ) , \\ { \cal j}[\psi_0\psi_2 ] & = & ( 2\pi f_0)^2~j(7 ) , \\ { \cal j}[\psi_1 ^ 2 ] & = & ( 2\pi f_0)^2~\frac{9}{25}j(17 ) , \\ { \cal j}[\psi_1\psi_2 ] & = & ( 2\pi f_0)^2~\frac{3}{5}j(15 ) , \\ { \cal j}[\psi_2 ^ 2 ] & = & ( 2\pi f_0)^2~j(13 ) . \end{array}\ ] ]    we can compute the needed moments of the noise by numerically evaluating the integrals ( [ moment definition ] ) . by setting the upper limit of integration to infinity , i.e.  by approximating @xmath146 as infinite for all templates under consideration , we find that the moments have the constant values given in table  [ tab : j s ] ; and therefore the moment functionals ( [ 1pn functionals ] ) have the constant values given in table  [ tab : cal j s ] . inserting these values into eqs . ( [ premetric ] ) and ( [ metric conversion ] ) yields , for the coordinates @xmath147 , the 3-metric and 2-metric @xmath148 @xmath149 for the first ligo noise curve , and @xmath150 @xmath151 for the advanced ligo noise curve ( where the dots denote terms obtained by symmetry ) . we shall also estimate the errors in the metric coefficients due to the approximation @xmath152 : the moment integrals defined in eq . ( [ moment definition ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath153 where the first integral is the expression used in the above metric coefficients and the second is the correction due to finite @xmath146 . the second integral can be expanded to lowest order in @xmath154 as @xmath155 and from this the errors in the moments ( and therefore in the metric coefficients ) due to approximating @xmath85 as infinite are estimated to be less than or of order ten percent for the first ligo interferometers and one percent for the advanced ligo interferometers over most of the relevant volume of parameter space . since the two - parameter , post@xmath1-newtonian continuous template family is known to be inadequate for the task of searching for real binaries , these errors are small enough to justify our use of the @xmath156 approximation in this exploratory analysis . since the metric coefficients are constant in this analysis , the formula for the required number of templates [ eq .  ( [ cal n definition ] ) ] reduces to @xmath157 the square root of the determinant of the metric is given by @xmath158 for the advanced ligo noise curve and by @xmath159 for the initial ligo noise curve , so once we have decided on the range of parameters we deem astrophysically reasonable we will have a formula for @xmath0 as a function of @xmath73 . the most straightforward belief to cherish about neutron stars is that they all come with masses greater than a certain minimum @xmath3 , which might be set to @xmath160 ( based on the minimum mass that any neutron star can have  ) or @xmath161 ( based on the observed masses of neutron stars in binary pulsar systems  @xcite ) . in terms of the variables @xmath134 the constraint @xmath162 and @xmath163 is easily expressed as @xmath164 but in terms of the sathyaprakash variables [ eqs . ( [ def : tau1 ] ) and ( [ def : tau2 ] ) ] the expression becomes rather unwieldy to write down . however , see fig . [ fig : volume ] for a plot of the allowed region in @xmath138 coordinates .    for this reason we have found it convenient to use a monte carlo integration routine  @xcite to evaluate the coordinate volume integral @xmath165 . the monte carlo approach becomes especially attractive when evaluating the proper volume integral @xmath166 for cases where the integrand is allowed to vary  and in fact may itself have to be evaluated numerically , as will be the case for a post@xmath9-newtonian set of templates . the integral has numerical values of @xmath167 and @xmath168 seconds@xmath9 for initial and advanced ligo interferometer parameters , respectively , assuming a @xmath3 of @xmath160 and arbitrarily large @xmath169 . the integral can be shown ( numerically ) to scale roughly as @xmath170 ( independent of @xmath79 ) and as @xmath171 for @xmath3 ranging from 0.2 to 1.0 solar masses ( the dependence on @xmath169 is negligible for any value greater than a few solar masses ) .    inserting the above numbers into eq . ( [ flat cal n ] ) , we find that @xmath172 for the first ligo noise curve and @xmath173 for the advanced ligo noise curve . the fiducial value of @xmath73 has been chosen as 0.97 to correspond to an event rate of roughly 90 percent of the ideal event rate [ cf . ( [ er vs mm ] ) ] . in terms of the template - spacing - induced fractional loss @xmath2 of event rate , the number of templates required is @xmath174 for the first ligo noise curve and @xmath175 for the advanced ligo noise curve .      with the aid of the metric coefficients given in eqs . ( [ 1st 1pn metric ] ) and ( [ adv 1pn metric ] ) , it is a simple task to select the locations of the templates and the spacing between them . because the metric coefficients form a constant @xmath176 matrix , we can easily find the eigenvectors @xmath177 and @xmath178 of @xmath179 and use them as axes to lay out a grid of templates . the numerical values are @xmath180 for the first ligo noise curve and @xmath181 for the advanced ligo noise curve . the infinitesimal proper distance is given in terms of the eigen - coordinates as @xmath182 , where @xmath183 and @xmath184 are the eigenvalues of the metric . therefore we simply use eq . ( [ mm vs dl ] ) to obtain the template spacings @xmath185 we find that the eigenvalues of the metrics ( [ 1st 1pn metric ] ) and ( [ adv 1pn metric ] ) are @xmath186 times 0.721 and 0.00427 ( first ligo ) , and @xmath186 times 1.25 and 0.00984 ( advanced ligo ) . therefore the template spacings are given by @xmath187 for the first ligo noise curve and by @xmath188 for the advanced ligo noise curve . figure  [ fig : contours ] shows the locations of some possible templates superposed on a contour plot of the match with the template in the center of the graph . drawing on the previous work of schutz  @xcite concerning the mechanics of fast - fourier - transforming the data , we can estimate the cpu power required to process the interferometer output on - line through a single - pass ( non - hierarchical ) search involving @xmath0 templates . although the data will be sampled at a rather high rate ( tens of khz ) , frequencies above some upper limit @xmath189 can be thrown away ( in fourier transforming the data ) with only negligible effects on the signal - to - noise ratio . this lowers the effective frequency of sampling to @xmath190 ( the factor of two is needed so that the nyquist frequency is @xmath191 ) , and thereby considerably reduces the task of performing the inner - product integrals . if the length of the array of numbers required to store a template is @xmath192 and that required to store a given stretch of data is @xmath193 , the number of floating point operations required to process that data stretch through @xmath0 filters is @xmath194 [ cf . ( 16.37 ) of schutz  @xcite , with the fractional overlap between data segments @xmath195 chosen as roughly @xmath196 . actually , @xmath192 varies from filter to filter , but most of the search templates occupy regions of parameter space where the mass is very low  and thus the storage size of the template , @xmath197 is very large @xcite . the longest filter is the one computed for two stars of mass @xmath3 , so by inserting @xmath198 and @xmath199 into eq . ( [ def : tau1 ] ) and combining with eq . ( [ storage size ] ) , we find that we can make a somewhat pessimistic estimate of the computational cost by using @xmath200    the required cpu power @xmath6 for an on - line search is obtained by dividing eq . ( [ n operations ] ) by the total duration of the data set , @xmath201 to find that @xmath202 combining eq . ( [ cpu power ] ) with eqs . ( [ 1st cal n ] ) and ( [ adv cal n ] ) gives us @xmath203 for an on - line search by the first ligo interferometers and @xmath204 for the advanced ligo interferometers . although the estimates in the paragraph above are not to be believed beyond a factor of order unity , the magnitude of the numbers shows that a hierarchical search strategy may be desirable to keep the computing power requirements at a reasonable level for non - supercomputing facilities . that is , the data would first be filtered through a more widely spaced ( low minimal match ) set of templates with a relatively low signal - to - noise threshold , and only the segments which exceed this preliminary threshold would be analyzed with the finely spaced ( high minimal match ) templates . the metric - based formalism of this paper only holds for the finely spaced set of templates used in the final stage of the hierarchical search ; the template spacing used in the earlier stages of the search will have to be chosen using more complex methods such as those of sathyaprakash and dhurandhar  . the only previous analysis of the problem of choosing the discrete search templates from the two - parameter , restricted post@xmath1-newtonian continuous template family is that of sathyaprakash  @xcite , in which he found that the entire volume of parameter space corresponding to @xmath205 could be covered by a set of templates which vary only in @xmath206thereby reducing the effective dimensionality of the mass parameter space to one . this implied a value of @xmath0 similar to that obtained in the one - parameter ( newtonian template ) analysis of dhurandhar and sathyaprakash in ref .  . it is not possible to fairly compare my value for @xmath0 to the values given by dhurandhar and sathyaprakash in table ii of ref .   due to our differing assumptions concerning the sources and the desirable level of the minimal match therefore i will compare the assumptions . dhurandhar and sathyaprakash typically consider a minimal match of 0.8 or 0.9 rather than 0.97 , this would lead to a loss of thirty to fifty percent of the ideal event rate [ cf . ( [ er vs mm ] ) ] . if the current `` best estimates '' of inspiraling binary event rates @xcite are correct , the ideal event rate for ligo and virgo will not be more than about one hundred per year even when operating at the `` advanced interferometer '' noise levels , and the loss of up to half of these events would be unacceptable .    from eqs . ( [ 1st cal n ] ) and ( [ adv cal n ] ) it can be seen that the dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath3 is the most important factor influencing the number of templates . the two - parameter analysis of sathyaprakash @xcite uses a value for @xmath3 of @xmath207 , which is based on the statistics of ( electromagnetically- ) known binary pulsars . however , because there is no known , firm physical mechanism that prevents neutron stars from forming with masses between 0.2 and 1 @xmath208 , ligo and virgo should use a discrete template family with @xmath209 . after all , laser interferometer gravitational wave detectors are expected to bring us information about astronomical objects as yet unknown .    during the final stages of completion of this manuscript , a new preprint by balasubramanian , sathyaprakash , and dhurandhar appeared in the xxx.lanl.gov archive  @xcite , applying differential geometry to the problem of detecting compact binary inspiral events and extracting source parameters from them . the preprint applies the tools of differential geometry primarily to the problem of parameter measurement rather than that of signal detection , and so does not develop the geometrical formalism as far as is done in sec .  [ sec : formalism ] of this paper . the metric constructed in ref . @xcite is identical to the information matrix which was suggested for use in the construction of a closely - spaced discrete template family in the authors previous work . while this is quite useful for parameter measurement , it neglects maximization over kinematical parameters and thus is not very useful for the construction of search templates . also , the assumptions about @xmath73 and @xmath3 are no different from those made in previous work up to and including ref . @xcite , and so the result for @xmath0 is no different .    the main difference between the results of ref . @xcite and previous analyses by the same authors  and therefore the most important part of the preprint as far as the detection problem is concerned  is the introduction of the possibility of choosing search templates to lie outside the manifold of the continuous template family . using an _ ad hoc _ example , the authors show that such a placement of templates can result in a spacing roughly double that between discrete templates chosen from the manifold formed by the continuous template family . my analysis in this paper does not consider this possibility , but the formalism of sec . [ sec : formalism ] can easily be extended to investigate this problem in the future . this paper has presented a method for semi - analytically calculating the number of templates required to detect gravity waves from inspiraling binaries with ligo as a function of the fraction of event rate lost due to the discrete spacing of the templates in the binary parameter space . this method , based on differential geometry , emphasizes that ultimately a finer template spacing is required than has previously been taken as typical in the literature , in order to retain a reasonable fraction of the event rate . this paper details the first calculation of this kind that uses post - newtonian templates and a noise curve which takes into account the coloration of noise in the detector due to both standard recycling photon shot noise and thermal noise in the suspension of the test masses . the result is that it is possible to search the data for binaries containing objects more massive than @xmath160 thoroughly enough to lose only @xmath210 10 percent of the ideal event rate without requiring a quantum leap in computing technology . the computational cost of such a search , conducted on - line using a single pass through the data , is roughly 20 gflops for the first ligo interferometers ( ca . 2000 ) and 270 gflops for the advanced ligo interferometers ( some years later ) . this is feasible ( or very nearly feasible ) even for a present - day supercomputing facility , but a hierarchical search strategy ( using as its first stage a widely - spaced set of templates similar to that analyzed by sathyaprakash  @xcite ) may be desirable to reduce the cost . a thorough investigation of hierarchical search strategies is in order : how should the threshold and the minimal match of the first stage be set in order to minimize the cpu power required while keeping the false alarm and false dismissal rates at acceptable levels ? how would non - gaussian noise statistics affect the first stage threshold and minimal match ? would a hierarchical search benefit by using more than two stages ? how is the threshold affected by the minimal match when the approximation of high signal - to - noise ratio can no longer be made ? the formalism of this paper should be applied to choose discrete templates from a better continuous template family than the one considered here . the best two - parameter templates will be based on the highest post - newtonian order computations that have been performed for circularized , spinless binaries , augmented perhaps by terms of still higher order from the theory of perturbations of schwarzschild or kerr spacetime . i plan to soon apply my geometric formalism to the post@xmath211-newtonian templates which are currently the best available . the areas of parameter space where spins can not be neglected ( noted by apostolatos in ref . @xcite ) must also be investigated , and the inclusion of an orbital eccentricity parameter should be considered . there are several more issues which i plan to address using my formalism or some extension of it . an analysis needs to be made for the case when the signal is not identical to some member of the continuous template family ( i.e.  the fitting factor is not equal to one ) ; and the result of such an analysis should be used to set definite goals for both the fitting factor and the minimal match in terms of event rate . the effect of non - quadrupolar harmonics of the gravitational wave on the construction of search templates should be considered . these harmonics have been ignored in all previous analyses of detection and even of parameter measurement , but they may have a noticeable effect when a very high minimal match is desired . finally , a systematic investigation of the optimal choice of search templates outside the continuous template family is in order . this problem has been addressed in a preliminary way in ref . @xcite , but is deserving of further scrutiny .    my thanks to theocharis apostolatos and eanna flanagan for helping me get started . i am most indebted to kip thorne for his guidance and his patience in reviewing the manuscript . this work was supported in part by my nsf graduate fellowship and in part by nsf grant phy-9424337 . a. abramovici , w. e. althouse , r. w. p. drever , y. grsel , s. kawamura , f. j. raab , d. shoemaker , l. sievers , r. e. spero , k. s. thorne , r. e. vogt , r. weiss , s. e. whitcomb , and m. e. zucker , science * 256 * , 325 ( 1992 ) .    c. bradaschia , e. calloni , m. cobal , r. del fasbro , a. di virgilio , a. giazotto , l. e. holloway , h. kautzky , b. michelozzi , v. montelatici , d. pascuello , and w. velloso , in _ gravitation 1990 _ , proceedings of the banff summer institute , ed . r. mann and p. wesson ( world scientific , singapore , 1991 ) .          see , e.g. , n. wiener , _ the extrapolation , interpolation and smoothing of stationary time series with engineering applications _ ( wiley , new york , 1949 ) or l. a. wainstein and v. d. zubakov , _ extraction of signals from noise _ ( prentice - hall , london , 1962 ) . note that the @xmath31 used here is the coalescence phase of the _ waveform_. in the restricted post - newtonian approximation , this is twice the coalescence phase of the _ orbit _ @xmath212 , which is used by cutler and flanagan in ref .  . this @xmath113-dimensional metric @xmath117 is related to the fisher information matrix , which was used by dhurandhar and sathyaprakash in the appendix of ref .   to compute the template spacing analytically in the small - spacing limit . however , in taking the absolute value to maximize over @xmath110 , we have lost some dependence on the dynamical ( intrinsic ) template parameters , so our @xmath213-metric is not even the projection of the information matrix onto the subspace perpendicular to @xmath31 . this lets us tolerate a greater mismatch between the templates dynamical parameters than was possible before maximization , thereby reducing the total number of templates required . the @xmath144 given here are different from those given in eq .

The authors propose a method for choosing discrete templates from a continuous template family, which is based on a geometric formalism. The method is called ""matched filtering"" and is used to filter out background noise and detect the signal.

The authors start by defining the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the metric of the template family, which is a measure of how well a template matches the signal. They use","gravitational waves from inspiraling , compact binaries will be searched for in the output of the ligo / virgo interferometric network by the method of `` matched filtering''i.e . , by correlating the noisy output of each interferometer with a set of theoretical waveform templates . 
 these search templates will be a discrete subset of a continuous , multiparameter family , each of which approximates a possible signal . 
 the search might be performed _ hierarchically _ , with a first pass through the data using a low threshold and a coarsely - spaced , few - parameter template set , followed by a second pass on threshold - exceeding data segments , with a higher threshold and a more finely spaced template set that might have a larger number of parameters . 
 alternatively , the search might involve a single pass through the data using the larger threshold and finer template set . 
 this paper extends and generalizes the sathyaprakash - dhurandhar ( s - d ) formalism for choosing the discrete , finely - spaced template set used in the final ( or sole ) pass through the data , based on the analysis of a single interferometer . 
 the s - d formalism is rephrased in geometric language by introducing a metric on the continuous template space from which the discrete template set is drawn . 
 this template metric is used to compute the loss of signal - to - noise ratio and reduction of event rate which result from the coarseness of the template grid . 
 correspondingly , the template spacing and total number @xmath0 of templates are expressed , via the metric , as functions of the reduction in event rate . 
 the theory is developed for a template family of arbitrary dimensionality ( whereas the original s - d formalism was restricted to a single nontrivial dimension ) . 
 the theory is then applied to a simple post@xmath1-newtonian template family with two nontrivial dimensions . for this family 
 , the number of templates @xmath0 in the finely - spaced grid is related to the spacing - induced fractional loss @xmath2 of event rate and to the minimum mass @xmath3 of the least massive star in the binaries for which one searches by @xmath4 for the first ligo interferometers and by @xmath5 for advanced ligo interferometers . 
 this is several orders of magnitude greater than one might have expected based on sathyaprakash s discovery of a near degeneracy in the parameter space , the discrepancy being due to this paper s lower choice of @xmath3 and more stringent choice of @xmath2 . 
 the computational power @xmath6 required to process the steady stream of incoming data from a single interferometer through the closely - spaced set of templates is given in floating - point operations per second by @xmath7 for the first ligo interferometers and by @xmath8 for advanced ligo interferometers . 
 this will be within the capabilities of ligo - era computers , but a hierarchical search may still be desirable to reduce the required computing power .",52675,528,2982,46.41 seconds,11.20 MB,0.21611721611721613,0.07720588235294117,0.1391941391941392,0.8175089955329895,medium
"understanding charge transport in graphene nanoribbons ( gnrs ) has attracted significant interest in recent years @xcite , in particular due to their potential application as integrated circuits @xcite and field - effect transistors @xcite , as bio - sensing devices @xcite , and for dna sequencing @xcite . these unprecedented opportunities have been made possible by experimental advances in creating sub-10 nm wide gnrs @xcite , in engineering gnrs with specific electronic structures @xcite , in fabricating high purity samples @xcite , and in designing artificial molecular graphene @xcite . moreover , due to their long mean - free path , gnrs are also an ideal system to explore the fundamental properties of out - of - equilibrium charge transport in nanoscopic quantum systems . previous theoretical studies investigating the transport properties of gnrs have predominantly focused on the bias dependent conductance @xcite . spatial current patterns were investigated in the vicinity of the fermi energy of half - filled gnrs in the wide - lead limit both for zero - magnetic field @xcite and for non - zero magnetic fields and disorder @xcite . recently , however , it was argued @xcite that in nanoscopic networks with narrow constrictions and/or narrow leads , spatial current patterns emerge which are qualitatively different from those in the wide - lead limit . in particular , these spatial current patterns exhibit clear signatures of quantum behavior : they ( a ) possess coherent current riverbeds "" , i.e. , spatial regions of large current density , whose widths are of the order of the fermi wave - length , and ( b ) are strongly dependent on boundary conditions , such as the position of the leads , the geometry and size of the network , as well as the gate voltage . these results clearly suggest that understanding the quantum nature of local charge transport in gnrs , as reflected in the form of spatial current patterns , and its dependence on a gnr s geometry and size , or the presence of dephasing , and developing a method to visualize it , is of utmost importance for the further development of graphene based nanoelectronics and dna sequencing .    in this article , we address this open question by demonstrating how the spatial current patterns in gnrs are determined by the interplay between the gnrs geometry , aspect ratio and size , by the location and number of leads , and the presence of dephasing . by using the non - equilibrium keldysh green s function formalism @xcite we find that the gnr s unconventional electronic structure @xcite is reflected not only in the bias dependence of the conductance , but also in the form of the spatial current paths . in particular , we find that each of a gnr s discrete transmission resonances possesses a characteristic spatial current pattern ( hence we refer to these resonances also as _ current eigenmodes _ in analogy to the equilibrium eigenmodes in the local density of states of nanoscopic systems ) . we demonstrate that the spatial form of these current patterns is determined by the number of degenerate states participating in the charge transport , which in turn allows us to predict how these current patterns evolve with increasing size or aspect ratio of a gnr . we show that current patterns can include closed loops of circulating currents , as well as exhibit _ backflow _ , i.e. , the flow of charge through certain links opposite to the direction of the net charge flow @xcite . we demonstrate that the spatial current paths are qualitatively different between leads attached to the zig - zag or armchair edges of the gnr and explore the form of charge transport parallel and perpendicular to edge states . moreover , we show that while current patterns in certain 4-lead configurations can arise from the superposition of two 2-lead configurations , the conductance does not necessarily obey the superposition principle . furthermore , we demonstrate that the quantum behavior of local charge transport can be visualized using scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) @xcite : it represents an essentially non - intrusive method to image spatial current paths in gnr with atomic resolution , providing important insight into the form of local charge transport . finally , we investigate more realistic models including the effects of dephasing and next - nearest - neighbor hopping , and show that with decreasing dephasing time , the current patterns evolve smoothly from those of a ballistic quantum network to those of a classical resistor network . these results provide important insight into the fundamental aspects of charge transport in nanoscopic graphene lattices . to study electron transport in a graphene nanostructure , we consider two one - dimensional leads coupled to a finite @xmath0 honeycomb lattice with @xmath1 hexagonal cells in the armchair direction , and @xmath2 cells in the zig - zag direction , shown schematically in figure  [ fig : ngl ] . graphene nanoribbon ( gnr ) . the leads are connected to gnr sites @xmath3 and @xmath4.,width=377 ]    the graphene nanoribbon is described by the hamiltonian @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the electronic hopping matrix element between sites @xmath7 in the gnr , and @xmath8 creates an electron with spin @xmath9 at site @xmath10 . in what follows , we take only the nearest neighbor hopping element , @xmath11 , to be non - zero ; the effects of a next - nearest neighbor hopping @xmath12 will be discussed in sec . [ sec : nnn ] . in order to account for the effects of dephasing , we assume that the electrons interact locally ( with coupling constant @xmath13 ) with a phonon mode of energy @xmath14 , as described by the last two terms in equation ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) , where @xmath15 creates a phonon at site @xmath10 . the coupling between the gnr and the leads is described by the hamiltonian @xmath16 where the primed sum runs over all sites @xmath10 and @xmath17 in the gnr and leads , respectively , that are coupled by a hopping element @xmath18 , and @xmath19 creates an electron with spin @xmath9 at site * l * in the leads . below , we assume that each of the two leads is coupled to a single gnr site only , labeled @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( see figure  [ fig : ngl ] ) . therefore , the only relevant property of the leads entering our calculations is the local green s function at the lead sites that are coupled to the gnr . finally , for the purpose of imaging spatial current patterns in the gnr @xcite , we consider the tunneling of electrons from an stm tip to a single site * t * in the gnr , a process which is described by the hamiltonian @xmath20 where @xmath21 annihilates an electron with spin @xmath9 in the stm tip . the spatial current patterns in a gnr are obtained by computing the current , @xmath22 , between adjacent sites @xmath10,@xmath23 in the gnr . this current is induced by different chemical potentials , @xmath24 in the left and right leads , and given by @xcite @xmath25 \ , \label{eq : current}\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the full keldysh green s function between sites @xmath10 and @xmath23 which accounts for the electronic hopping within the gnr and between the gnr and the leads , as well as the electron - phonon interaction . we next introduce a matrix notation such that the keldysh green s function matrix is given by @xmath27 , and its @xmath28 element , @xmath29 , is the keldysh green s function between sites in the gnr denoted by @xmath30 and @xmath31 . in the absence of an electron - phonon interaction , one finds @xmath32 with @xmath33 { \rm i m } \left [ { \hat g}^r(\omega ) \right]$ ] . here , @xmath34 are the diagonal retarded , advanced and keldysh green s function matrices , respectively , containing the green s functions of the decoupled ( @xmath35 ) gnr sites and leads : for the gnr sites , we have @xmath36 with @xmath37 while for the leads , we assume the wide - band limit and take @xmath38 , yielding a constant density of states @xmath39 in the leads . finally , @xmath40 is a diagonal matrix containing the fermi - distribution functions and @xmath41 is the symmetric hopping matrix . moreover , the local density of states at site @xmath10 in the gnr is obtained via @xmath42 . for the results shown below , we have used for numerical convenience @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , unless otherwise specified . all spatial currents , @xmath46 , presented below are normalized to the largest current in the gnr .    to account for the effects of the electron - phonon interaction for general @xmath47 and @xmath48 is computationally demanding and beyond the scope of this article . however , since we are mainly interested in the effects of dephasing on the spatial current patterns , we can consider the high - temperature approximation introduced in ref . @xcite . in this limit with @xmath49 , implying a large thermal population of the phonon mode , the calculation of the electronic self - energy correction is greatly simplified and computationally possible even for larger gnr sizes . retaining in the dyson equation only those terms that contain a factor of @xmath50 , the electronic self - energy in the self - consistent born approximation is given by @xmath51 where @xmath30 denotes a site in the gnr and @xmath52 . moreover , @xmath53 \left [ \delta(\omega + \omega_{0 } ) - \delta(\omega - \omega_{0})\right]\ ] ] is the keldysh phonon green s function , which we assume to remain unchanged by the electron - phonon interaction , and @xmath54 is the phonon bose distribution function ( we assume that the phonons remain in thermal equilibrium ) . note that due to the coupling to local phonon modes , the electronic self - energy is entirely local . a further simplification is achieved by considering the limit @xmath55 such that the self - energy , to leading order in @xmath56 , is given by @xmath57 as shown before @xcite , the solution of the dyson equation for the retarded green s function is then given by @xmath58^{-1 } \hat{g}^{r } \label{eq : se2}\ ] ] where @xmath59 is a superoperator introduced in ref . @xcite which , when operating on a green s function matrix , returns the same matrix with all elements set to zero except for the diagonal elements in the matrix that correspond to sites in the gnr , e.g. , @xmath60_{ij } = \cases{g_{ij}^{\alpha}\delta_{ij } & if $ i$ is a site in the gnr\\ 0 & otherwise \ . \\}\ ] ]    after self - consistently solving equation ( [ eq : se2 ] ) for @xmath61 , @xmath62 can be obtained in a closed expression via @xmath63 where the diagonal matrix @xmath64 is defined via @xmath65 _ { l } .\ ] ] here , the vector @xmath66 has components @xmath67 with @xmath68 being a diagonal matrix whose only non - zero elements @xmath69 are those where @xmath30 denotes one of the two leads . the matrix @xmath70 contains the elements @xmath71 gnr , and ( b ) - ( h ) spatial current patterns for different @xmath73 . all spatial currents , @xmath46 , are normalized to the largest current in the gnr . yellow arrow in ( f ) indicates a circulating current loop . the leads are connected to gnr sites @xmath3 and @xmath4 . ] we begin by discussing charge transport , and in particular the relation between the conductance and spatial current patterns , in an @xmath74 gnr in the absence of the electron - phonon interaction . in figure [ fig : ngl11x5](a ) , we present the gnr s total conductance @xmath75 in the limit @xmath76 which is given by @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the bias midpoint with @xmath79 , @xmath80 is the leads local density of states , and @xmath81 is the non - local green s function between sites @xmath3 and @xmath4 where the current enters and exits the gnr ( see figure  [ fig : ngl ] ) , respectively @xcite . due to its finite size , the gnr possesses discrete energy levels @xcite which for @xmath82 are given by @xmath83 ^ 2 =   1 \pm 4\cos\frac{\pi j}{2 ( n_{z } + 1 ) } \cos \frac{\kappa_{j}^{\pm}}{2 } + 4 \cos^{2}\frac{\pi j}{2(n_{z}+1)}\ ] ] where the @xmath84 are solutions of @xmath85 as a result , the conductance exhibits discrete transmission resonances whenever @xmath86 equals the energy a state whose wavefunction does not vanish at the site that the leads are coupled to . for each of these resonances , the current flowing through the gnr exhibits a different spatial pattern ( the resonances are therefore also referred to as current eigenmodes @xcite , in analogy to eigenmodes in the density of states ) . the spatial current patterns [ as obtained from equation ( [ eq : current ] ) ] for a number of current eigenmodes are shown in figures  [ fig : ngl11x5](b ) - ( h ) [ due to the particle - hole symmetry of the gnr s electronic structure , the conductance is symmetric around @xmath87 and the eigenmodes at @xmath88 exhibit identical current patterns ; we therefore restrict our discussion below to the case @xmath89 . note that these eigenmodes can in general be accessed experimentally via gating of the gnr . similar to prior results @xcite , we find that there exists current eigemodes which exhibit circulating current loops [ as indicated by a yellow arrow in figure  [ fig : ngl11x5](f ) ] or which possess a net current through the gnr which is significantly smaller than some of the currents within the gnr [ see figure  [ fig : ngl11x5](b ) ] . of particular interest is the well - ordered current pattern that occurs for @xmath90 shown in figure  [ fig : ngl11x5](d ) . to understand the spatial form of this current pattern , we note that charge transport for @xmath90 with leads attached to the zig - zag edge involves a @xmath91fold degenerate @xmath92 state ( not including @xmath93 states with vanishing amplitude along the zig - zag edge @xcite ) , whose wave - vectors are shown in figure  [ fig : x5](a ) ( solid and open circles ) ; for comparison , we also present the @xmath92 equal energy contour for an infinitely large graphene sheet ( solid line ) . only three of these 5 states [ green circles in figure  [ fig : x5](a ) ] possess a non - zero wavefunction at the gnr sites @xmath3 and @xmath4 that the leads couple to in figure [ fig : ngl11x5 ] and thus contribute to the charge transport at @xmath90 . the fermi velocity at @xmath92 is given by @xmath94 [ see figure  [ fig : x5](a ) ] and thus parallel to the primitive lattice vectors of one of the triangular sublattices of graphene . as follows from figure [ fig : ngl11x5](d ) , the current propagates generally along the same direction . thus , the spatial current pattern is reminiscent of the motion of a ballistic particle that is specularly reflected off the walls of the gnr . we find that this relation between the spatial current pattern and @xmath95 holds whenever there are degenerate states with the same @xmath95 participating in the charge transport . the relation between the spatial current pattern for @xmath96 , the aspect ratio of the gnr , and the degeneracy of the @xmath92 state will be discussed in more detail in section  [ sec : aspect ] . it is noteworthy that , in the vicinity of @xmath96 , the spatial form of the current patterns evolves rapidly with increasing @xmath73 [ see figures  [ fig : ngl11x5](c ) - ( e ) ] while for larger values of @xmath73 , the spatial form evolves more slowly [ see figures  [ fig : ngl11x5](f ) - ( h ) ] . finally , we note that for finite - sized gnrs , there exist two states near zero energy at @xmath97 , that are delocalized along the zig - zag edge , but localized in the armchair direction @xcite . for @xmath98 , the gnr therefore exhibits strongly anisotropic transport properties in the armchair and zig - zag directions , as discussed in more detail in section  [ sec : edge ] . states ( closed and open circles ) in an @xmath74 gnr together with the @xmath92 equal energy contour in the brillouin zone of an infinite graphene sheet . the wave -

( g ) contour plot of the normalized density of states of the @xmath74 gnr at @xmath92.,width=604 ]    in the ballistic limit , spatial current patterns in nanoscale systems sensitively depend on boundary conditions such as the location of the leads or the geometry or aspect ratio of the system @xcite . to investigate this issue in gnrs , we next study the dependence of spatial current patterns on the aspect ratio , @xmath101 of the gnr , as well as the location of the leads . to exemplify this dependence , we consider the current eigenmode at @xmath96 , since it does not only exhibit a spatially highly ordered structure , but also occurs in all gnrs considered below . in figure [ fig : x5 ] , we present the evolution of the spatial current pattern with increasing @xmath100 in @xmath99 gnrs for @xmath96 . we note for the discussion below that in all of these gnrs , there exist @xmath100 states at @xmath92 whose wavefunction vanishes at the sites that the leads are attached to @xcite ; those states are therefore irrelevant for the purpose of the charge transport considered here and will not be discussed below . the spatial current patterns in the gnrs exhibit two types of characteristic forms . in particular , in gnrs that satisfy @xmath102 with integer @xmath103 , the current follows the direction of the fermi velocity , @xmath95 , being specularly reflected off the walls of the gnr , as shown in figures  [ fig : x5](b ) and ( e ) . in these gnrs , there are @xmath104 states at @xmath92 whose wavefunctions do not vanish at sites @xmath3 and @xmath4 ; their wave - vectors are shown in figure  [ fig : x5](a ) ( green circles ) , together with the @xmath92 equal - energy contour of an infinite graphene sheet . with increasing @xmath103 , certain elements of the spatial current pattern are repeated [ for example , the current pattern in figure  [ fig : x5](e ) with @xmath105 consists of two copies of the current pattern of figure  [ fig : x5](b ) plus an additional current loop connecting these two elements ] . in contrast , the gnrs shown in figure  [ fig : x5](c),(d ) , and ( f ) do not satisfy the above requirement , possessing only a single @xmath92 state [ whose wave - vector is shown as the open circle in figure  [ fig : x5](a ) ] . consequently , these structures exhibit current patterns that are significantly more complex and possess a series of traits characteristic of quantum mechanical charge transport in nanostructures @xcite . in particular , these current patterns exhibit circulating current loops that are isolated [ see red arrow in figure  [ fig : x5](c ) ] and thus do not contribute to the net current through the gnr . such current loops give rise to magnetic fields that could potentially be detected experimentally : we estimate that the magnetic field at the center of the current loop indicated by an arrow in figure [ fig : x5](c ) is approximately @xmath106 t . in addition , these current patterns exhibit backflow : while a net current flows from the left to the right ( @xmath107 ) , there exist certain bonds in the gnr where the current flows from right to left ( and thus opposite to the applied bias ) , such as the ones indicated by a yellow arrow in figure  [ fig : x5](d ) . we find that circulating current loops and backflow occurs in all gnrs in which the current pattern does not simply reflect the direction of the fermi velocity , @xmath95 , as is the case in figures  [ fig : x5](b ) and ( e ) . finally , in figure  [ fig : x5](g ) we present the local density of states for the @xmath74 gnr ( with leads attached ) at @xmath92 , which has no resemblance to the form of the spatial current pattern shown in figure  [ fig : x5](e ) , a conclusion that was previously also drawn for nanoscale systems with a square lattice geometry @xcite . this result stands in contrast to earlier findings relating either the spatial current pattern at @xmath73 directly to that of the modulus of the wave - function , @xmath108 @xcite ( which possesses the same spatial structure as the density of states , @xmath109 , since @xmath110 ) , or the spatial flow of electrons to the spatial form of @xmath111 @xcite . more generally , our results demonstrate that conductance variations measured in spm experiments can not simultaneously reflect the spatial flow of electrons @xcite and the spatial form of @xmath111 @xcite . different types of current patterns emerge when the size of the gnr is increased along the zig - zag direction , as shown in figures  [ fig:7x](a ) - ( d ) . here , we present the evolution of the current patterns with increasing @xmath112 in @xmath113 gnrs at @xmath96 . the current patterns for the @xmath114 gnr ( which possesses a 7-fold degenerate state at @xmath92 , with 4 of these states possessing a non - zero wavefunction at gnr sites @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) is similar to that of the @xmath115 or @xmath74 gnrs , with the current propagating predominantly along the direction of the fermi velocity . with increasing @xmath112 , the current patterns become more complex , exhibit circulating current loops of various sizes [ see yellow arrows in figures  [ fig:7x](d ) and ( h ) ] , and current backflow [ see yellow arrow in figure  [ fig:7x](c ) ] . we can identify an interesting relation between the number of degenerate states at @xmath92 , and the form of the current pattern : while the @xmath116 and @xmath117 gnrs possess only a single state at @xmath92 , and their spatial current patterns exhibit some similar subpatterns , the @xmath118 gnr possesses three degenerate states ( two of which possess a non - zero wavefunction at sites @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) , resulting in a current pattern that is qualitatively different from that of the @xmath116 and @xmath117 gnrs . all of these current eigenmodes exhibit a different response to ( symmetric ) changes in the location of the leads , as shown in figures  [ fig:7x](e)-(h ) . for the @xmath114 gnr , the current pattern simply deforms , but the current still propagates along the direction of the fermi velocity . in contrast , for the @xmath116 , @xmath118 and @xmath117 gnrs , the current pattern undergoes a qualitative change when the leads are symmetrically displaced . this reiterates the fact that charge transport through confined systems in the quantum regime is highly sensitive to boundary conditions , and the spatial form of the resulting coherent current eigenmode need not necessarily conform to expectations based on @xmath95 . gnr with leads attached at different locations along the armchair edges.,width=529 ]    the question naturally arises whether the same type of spatial current patterns emerge when the leads are attached to the armchair edges . to investigate this question , we consider a @xmath114 gnr [ the same gnr as shown in figure  [ fig:7x](a ) ] and present in figure  [ fig : arm ] the current patterns at @xmath96 for different locations of 4 leads attached to the armchair edges . when the leads are attached to the center sites , as shown in figure  [ fig : arm](a ) , the dominant contribution to the current flows along a line directly connecting the leads , rather than following the direction of the fermi velocity . however , when the leads are displaced symmetrically from these high symmetry sites as shown in figures  [ fig : arm](b ) and ( c ) , the current flows again primarily along the direction of the fermi velocity . it is interesting to note that in all three cases [ figures  [ fig : arm](a)-(c ) ] , the current exhibits two disjoint current paths , connecting either the left ( leads 1 and 3 ) or right ( leads 2 and 4 ) pair of leads . when one of these pairs of leads is removed ( and the spatial symmetry of the system is thus broken ) , as shown in figures  [ fig : arm](d ) where only leads 2 and 4 remain , the current pattern becomes rather diffuse ( a very similar current pattern is found when only leads 2 and 3 remain ) . this not only demonstrates that the symmetry of the armchair edges requires two leads to be attached to either armchair edge for a well - defined current pattern to emerge , but also that quantum interference effects between all four leads are crucial for creating the well - ordered current patterns shown in figures  [ fig : arm](b ) and ( c ) . gnrs possess two low energy states near the middle of the band at @xmath97 , i.e. , in close proximity to @xmath119 , that are delocalized along the zig - zag edge , and localized along the direction of the armchair edge @xcite . the form of charge transport through these localized states in the wide - lead limit has recently attracted some attention @xcite , in particular in view of its possible application for dna sequencing @xcite . in figure [ fig : edge](a ) , we present the local density of states for a @xmath120 gnr at @xmath121 , that clearly demonstrates the localized nature of these low energy states .     demonstrating the existence of an edge state that is delocalized along the zig - zag edges , and decays exponentially along the armchair direction . spatial current patterns for a voltage bias applied ( b ) between the armchair edges , and ( c ) between the zig - zag edges.,width=453 ]    as a result , we expect that the charge transport at @xmath122 is highly anisotropic . to investigate this anisotropy , we consider the @xmath120 gnr with four leads attached to sites along their zig - zag edges , as shown in figures  [ fig : edge](b ) and ( c ) . when a voltage bias is applied between the armchair edges with @xmath122 , ( with chemical potential @xmath123 for leads 3 and 4 , and @xmath124 for leads 1 and 2 ) , the current flow is highly localized along the zig - zag edges , as shown in figure  [ fig : edge](b ) , where the @xmath125 state is delocalized . in this case , the conductance of the @xmath125 state ( in the four - lead configuration ) is equal to the quantum of conductance ( similarly , the state at @xmath126 possesses a conductance given by the quantum of conductance ) . this result holds for all values of @xmath100 or @xmath112 that we have considered . moreover , for an infinitely large gnr in the armchair direction , i.e. , @xmath127 , one has a doubly degenerate state at @xmath128 ( one localized state at each of the zig - zag edges ) , and the conductance of the gnr at @xmath119 is as expected equal to twice the quantum of conductance . note that the spatial current pattern in figure  [ fig : edge](b ) is qualitatively different from that obtained when wide leads are attached to the armchair edges : in this case , the largest current density occurs in the center of the gnr @xcite and not along the zig - zag edges . on the other hand , when a voltage bias is applied between the zig - zag edges ( with chemical potential @xmath123 for leads 1 and 3 , and @xmath124 for leads 2 and 4 ) , the current is strongly suppressed [ see figure  [ fig : edge](c ) ] , and scales as @xmath129 . since @xmath130 decreases exponentially with increasing length @xmath1 @xcite , we find that the current along the armchair direction also decreases exponentially with increasing length of the gnr , as expected from the localized nature of the @xmath131-states .      do quantum mechanical currents obey the principle of superposition ? in particular , can spatial current patterns in gnrs that are attached to four leads , simply be obtained by superposing two - lead current patterns such as the ones discussed above ? to address this question we compare the spatial current patterns at @xmath96 in 4-lead and 2-lead configurations for two gnrs with different aspect ratios .    in figure  [ fig:4leads_1 ] , we present the current patterns for a @xmath132 gnr in 4-lead configurations with the leads attached symmetrically around the center of the gnr , as shown in figures  [ fig:4leads_1](a ) - ( c ) , or with two leads attached , as shown in figures  [ fig:4leads_1](d ) - ( f ) .     in a @xmath132 gnr for ( a)-(c ) 4-lead and ( d ) - ( f ) 2-lead configurations.,width=453 ]    since the gnr possesses 9 degenerate states at @xmath92 , we again find that the current follows predominantly the direction of the fermi velocity , thus propagating along the direction of the primitive lattice vector . moreover , changing the separation between the leads simply deforms the current pattern , but does not introduce any qualitatively new spatial elements . a comparison of the 4-lead current patterns in figures  [ fig:4leads_1](a ) and ( b ) with the current patterns in a symmetric 2-lead configuration shown in figures  [ fig:4leads_1](d ) and ( e ) , respectively , demonstrates that the 4-lead current pattern indeed represents a superposition ( i.e. , is the sum ) of two 2-lead current patterns . moreover , the current flowing in the 4-lead configuration is twice that of the 2-lead configurations . this implies that in the 4-lead configuration , there are no interference effects between the two superposing 2-lead current patterns , and that , in particular , no current flow occurs between the upper ( leads 1 and 3 ) or lower ( leads 2 and 4 ) pair of leads . we also note that the 4-lead current pattern in figure  [ fig:4leads_1](b ) is not the superposition of the 2-lead current pattern with just the upper two leads ( leads 1 and 3 ) in figure  [ fig:4leads_1](f ) , with its respective counterpart . in this case , the spatial current pattern is very diffuse , since the two leads can not be connected by a current path that propagates along @xmath133 , and the total current is only approximately 58.5% of that in the 2-lead configuration of figure  [ fig:4leads_1](e ) . gnr at @xmath96 for ( a)-(c ) 4-lead and ( d ) 2-lead configurations.,width=377 ]    in contrast , a @xmath117 gnr possesses only a single state at @xmath92 , and the spatial form and complexity of the current pattern at @xmath96 changes qualitatively when the separation between the leads on each side of the gnr is varied , as shown in figures  [ fig:4leads_2](a)-(c ) . when the leads are attached to the corners [ see figure  [ fig:4leads_2](a ) ] , the current flows along the edges and through the center of the gnr . at the same time , there are two large , circulating current loops in the upper and lower parts of the gnr , that do not contribute to the net current through the gnr . in contrast , when the separation between the leads is reduced [ see figure  [ fig:4leads_2](b ) ] , the current flows along the direction of @xmath133 , which directly connects the leads , while most of the gnr does not exhibit any charge flow at all . upon reducing the separation between leads even further , the current pattern again becomes more complex [ see figure  [ fig:4leads_2](c ) ] : the current now flows primarily along the outer perimeter , while connected to a larger circulating current loop in the center of the gnr . in figure [ fig:4leads_2](d ) , we present the corresponding 2-lead current pattern ; the superposition of this pattern with its counterpart yields a spatial current pattern that is identical to that of figure  [ fig:4leads_2](c ) . however , the total current through the 4-lead and 2-lead configurations is the same since [ in contrast to the @xmath132 gnr ] there is only a single state that contributes to the charge transport at @xmath96 , thus limiting the conductance for both configurations to a single quantum of conductance . in other words , the spatial current in the 4-lead configuration is half the sum of the currents of the two 2-lead configurations . the degeneracy of the @xmath92 state therefore does not only affect the spatial form of the current patterns in 2-lead configurations , but also whether the current patterns and total conductance in 4-lead configurations arises as a superposition of current patterns and conductances of 2-lead configurations . the observation that localized states exist near zig - zag edges in gnrs raises the interesting question of the form of localized state in other gnr geometries @xcite . to investigate this question , we consider the diamond - shaped gnr shown in figure  [ fig : diamond ] whose edges are only of the zig - zag type .     in a diamond - shaped gnr . ( b ) spatial current pattern for @xmath96 , and ( c ) local density of states at @xmath92.,width=302 ]    a plot of the local density of states at @xmath119 [ see figure  [ fig : diamond](a ) ] reveals that a localized state exists , but that it is not confined to the zig - zag edges of the gnr [ as was the case for the gnr shown in figure  [ fig : edge](a ) ] but to its two corners with acute angles . moreover , while the gnr possesses three degenerate states at @xmath92 , we find that the current does not follow the direction of the fermi velocity ( which would require it to flow along the edges of the gnr ) , but rather flows through the gnr s center , as shown in figure  [ fig : diamond](b ) . finally , a plot of the local density of states at @xmath92 in figure  [ fig : diamond](c ) , which is the largest in the gnr s center , again reveals no resemblance to the spatial current pattern , as previously discussed in the context of figure  [ fig : x5 ] . the ability to experimentally visualize spatial current patterns is crucial for understanding and manipulating transport at the nanoscopic or atomic scale . in mesoscopic systems , such as quantum point contacts @xcite , quantum rings @xcite and dna @xcite , imaging of spatial current paths was successfully achieved using scanning probe microscopy ( spm ) @xcite . the spatial resolution of spm , however , is insufficient to image spatial current patterns predicted to exist in nanoscopic systems @xcite which vary on the atomic scale . two of us therefore recently proposed a novel method for the imaging of spatial current paths in nanoscopic systems based on scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) @xcite , a method that can resolve spatial current patterns on the scale of a lattice constant . in addition , in the experimentally realized weak tunneling limit @xcite , this stm method only probes but essentially does not perturb the gnr s electronic structure , in contrast to spm .    to demonstrate that this method for the spatial imaging of currents can also successfully be applied to gnrs , we consider as an example the current patterns in figures  [ fig:7x](a ) and ( e ) for the @xmath114 gnr , and in figure  [ fig : x5](e ) for the @xmath74 gnr . to visualize these spatial current patterns , we plot the spatial dependence of the current , @xmath134 , that flows from an stm tip ( held above the gnr at potential @xmath135 ) through the gnr into the left ( l ) or right ( r ) lead as a function of tip position @xmath136 ( for a more detailed description , see ref . the tunneling of electrons from the stm tip into the gnr is described by the hamiltonian in equation ( [ eq : tunnel ] ) . here , we set the bias between the leads to zero , i.e. , @xmath137 , and require that the bias difference between the tip and the system , @xmath138 be equal to @xmath139 , and that the bias midpoint @xmath140 be equal to @xmath73 ( here , @xmath73 and @xmath139 were used to generate the actual current patterns ) . flowing from the stm tip into the left lead . ( d ) conductance @xmath141 as a function of bias midpoint @xmath73 for the @xmath114 gnr . here , we used @xmath142.,width=396 ]    in figures  [ fig : stm](a ) - ( c ) , we present the resulting stm image , i.e. , the spatial plots of @xmath143 , which correspond to the current patterns in figures  [ fig:7x](a ) and ( e ) and in figure  [ fig : x5](e ) , respectively . a comparison of the actual current patterns with the stm images shows that the latter provide an accurate and atomically resolved image of the spatial current patterns . this agreement holds even when the leads are not located at high symmetry positions , as shown in figures  [ fig:7x](e ) and [ fig : stm](b ) , or when the size of the system increases , and the current pattern becomes repetitive , as in figures  [ fig : x5](e ) and [ fig : stm](c ) . moreover , we demonstrated in ref . @xcite , that the form of the total conductance , @xmath141 , is an independent , experimentally verifiable , criterion for the success of the stm method in imaging spatial current patterns . in particular , we found that when @xmath141 is close to the maximal allowed conductance , and varies weakly around a given @xmath73 , the stm method successfully images the spatial current patterns at @xmath73 in the entire nanoscopic system . on the other hand , if @xmath141 is sharply peaked , the agreement breaks down in at least part of the network . the @xmath114 gnr considered here satisfies this criterion , as follows from figure  [ fig : stm](d ) , where we present its conductance @xmath141 : it is close to the quantum of conductance at @xmath144 ( see arrow ) where we image the current pattern and its width ( as a function of @xmath73 ) is larger than the distance between two peaks . note that the zeros in the conductance @xmath141 correspond to zeroes of the real part of the retarded green s function for @xmath145 which occur near , but never exactly on , conductance resonances . more generally , we find that the above criterion for @xmath141 is satisfied in nanoscopic networks which ( a ) possess a continuum of energy eigenstates through which transport can take place or ( b ) are strongly coupled to leads . finally , we note in passing that understanding the magnitude and spatial paths of currents injected from the stm tip into the gnr , will likely also have relevance for dna sequencing where currents are induced locally by pulling a dna through a hole in a gnr @xcite . for an @xmath74 gnr with a constriction ( shown in gray ) : ( a ) @xmath146 with mean free path @xmath147 ( b ) @xmath148 , @xmath149 , ( c ) @xmath150 , @xmath151 , ( d ) @xmath152 , @xmath153.,width=377 ]    to study the effects of dephasing on the form of spatial current patterns , we consider the coupling of electrons to a local phonon mode @xcite , as described by the hamiltonian in equation ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) . as discussed in section  [ sec : theory ] , we employ the high - temperature approximation , where the dephasing is controlled by a single parameter , @xmath154 [ see equation ( [ eq : sigma ] ) ] . in figure  [ fig : dephasing ] we present the evolution of the spatial current pattern with increasing @xmath154 for an @xmath74 gnr that contains a constriction shown in gray . in the absence of dephasing , i.e. , for @xmath155 , [ see figure  [ fig : dephasing](a ) ] , the current pattern is similar to that of the @xmath74 gnr without a constriction , as shown in figure  [ fig : x5](e ) . we note that while the constriction is located in a region of the gnr through which no current flows in figure  [ fig : x5](e ) , it nevertheless leads to a change in the actual current pattern . as @xmath154 increases , the current pattern becomes more diffuse , and evolves smoothly from the ballistic limit [ see figure  [ fig : dephasing](a ) ] , to that of a classical resistor network [ see figure[fig : dephasing](d ) ] . moreover , with increasing @xmath154 , the current pattern remains well defined in the vicinity of the leads , but becomes more diffuse as one moves further away from the leads [ see regions indicated by yellow arrows in figure  [ fig : dephasing](c ) ] . this is expected since the diffuse current pattern arises from multiple scattering of the electrons off phonons , and the resulting dephasing . while required by symmetry , it is nevertheless interesting to note that the effects of dephasing are reversed ( with the spatial current pattern again becoming more coherent ) as the current approaches the site where it exits the gnr . this phenomenon of current patterns exhibiting coherent ( well - defined ) and incoherent ( diffusive ) spatial regions occurs when the mean - free path is considerably shorter than the size of the gnr [ in figure  [ fig : dephasing](c ) , one has @xmath151 ] , but larger than a few lattice spacings . as the mean - free path becomes shorter , the region around the leads where the current forms a well defined , coherent pattern shrinks and eventually vanishes [ see figure  [ fig : dephasing](d ) ] .      in the preceding sections , we neglected the effects of a possible next - nearest neighbor hopping , @xmath12 , on the form of the electronic excitation spectrum and the resulting conductance and spatial currents patterns in gnrs . the question naturally arises to what extent a non - zero @xmath12 , with estimates ranging from @xmath157 to @xmath158 @xcite , qualitatively affects the results presented above .    in macroscopic graphene lattices , the existence of a non - zero @xmath12 is often neglected , not only because of the large uncertainty in its value , but also because its effects on the electronic excitation spectrum are rather trivial . in particular , the energy dispersion for a non - zero @xmath12 is given by @xcite @xmath159 where @xmath160 as a result , all momentum states located at an energy @xmath161 for @xmath162 are simply shifted to a new energy @xmath163\ ] ] for @xmath164 . this , in particular , implies that the degeneracy of states is not lifted by a non - zero @xmath12 .    for finite - size gnrs , however , the situation is different since a non - zero @xmath12 lifts the degeneracy of the states which for @xmath165 are located at @xmath92 states . the extent of the energy splitting between these states is non - universal and depends not only on the aspect ratio of the gnr , but also on its overall size , since , according to eq.([eq : ektp ] ) , the splitting vanishes in the limit of infinitely large graphene layers where degeneracy is restored .     when @xmath166 . if @xmath24 are chosen to bracket all three conductance resonances , well - ordered current patterns are produced for the ( b ) @xmath115 gnr at @xmath167 with @xmath168 , @xmath169 , and @xmath170 , and ( c ) @xmath171 gnr at @xmath172 with @xmath173 , @xmath174 , and @xmath175 . ( d ) the ldos for the edge states at energy @xmath176 . , width=566 ]    in figure [ fig : nnn](a ) , we present a conductance scan for a @xmath115 gnr with @xmath177 over an energy range that contains all three states ( and only those ) that are located at @xmath92 for @xmath166 , and possess a non - zero wavefunction at @xmath3 and @xmath4 . choosing a left and right chemical potential that brackets these three states [ see vertical red lines in figure [ fig : nnn](a ) ] , we find that the resulting spatial current pattern shown in figure [ fig : nnn](b ) still agrees very well with that obtained for the case @xmath166 , as follows from a comparison of figures [ fig : nnn](b ) and [ fig : x5](b ) . the same conclusion also holds for larger gnrs and different values of @xmath12 , as follows from a comparison of the current pattern for a @xmath74 gnr with @xmath178 shown in figure [ fig : nnn](c ) with that for @xmath165 shown in figure [ fig : x5](e ) . this implies that for both cases , @xmath166 and @xmath179 , the same ( well - ordered ) spatial current pattern occurs if the left and right chemical potentials are chosen such that they bracket all states which for @xmath166 occur at @xmath92 . finally , we found that a non - zero @xmath12 shifts the energy of the state localized along the zig - zag edge near @xmath180 for @xmath166 , but does not change its localized nature or spatial structure . in figure [ fig : nnn](d ) we present the local density of states for @xmath181 at @xmath182 , which demonstrates that this state remains localized along the zig - zag edge . in this article , we investigated the quantum nature of local charge transport in graphene nanoribbons , as reflected in the form of spatial current patterns . by using the non - equilibrium keldysh green s function formalism @xcite , we demonstrated that the form of spatial current patterns is determined by the interplay between the gnrs geometry , size and aspect ratio , by the location and number of leads , and the presence of dephasing . in particular , we identified a crucial relation between the spatial form of current patterns , and the number of degenerate states participating in the transport . this insight , in principle , provides us with the opportunity to predict and custom - design spatial current patterns in gnrs . furthermore , we showed that the number of degenerate states participating in charge transport also determines whether current patterns and conductances in gnrs with 4-lead configurations can be considered as arising from the superposition of current patterns and conductances in 2-lead configurations . in addition , we showed that spatial current patterns in gnr can be spatially imaged with atomic resolution using scanning tunneling microscopy , allowing us to gain unique insight into the nature of local charge transport . we also demonstrated how spatial current patterns evolve with increasing dephasing from the ballistic limit , where they are coherent and spatially well defined , to the classical limit , where they are incoherent and spatially diffuse . finally , we showed that our conclusions remain valid in the presence of a realistic next - nearest neighbor hooping element . these results represent an important first step towards understanding and manipulating charge transport at the atomic level in gnrs , which are a necessary requirement for the further development of graphene based nanoelectronics and dna sequencing . + * acknowledgements *    we would like to thank d. goldhaber - gordon and h. manoharan for stimulating discussions . this work is supported by the u.s . department of energy , office of basic energy sciences , division of materials sciences and engineering under award no . de - fg02 - 05er46225 ( d.k.m ) and by a u.s . department of education gaann fellowship and mrsec nsf dmr-0820054 ( t.c . ) . < num >    munoz - rojas f , jacob d , fernandez - rossier j and palacios j j 2006 _ phys . _ b * 74 * 195417 cresti a , grosso g and parravicini g p 2007 _ phys . _ b * 76 * 205433 zarbo l p and nikolic b k 2007 _ eur . lett . _ * 80 * 47001 li z , qian h , wu j , gu b - l and duan w 2008 _ phys . lett . _ * 100 * 206802 maiti s k 2009 _ solid state commun . _ * 149 * 973        gonzalez j w , santos h , pacheco m , chico l and brey l 2010 _ phys _ b * 81 * 195406 takaki h and kobayashi n 2010 _ japan j. appl . phys . _ * 49 * 08lb04 takaki h and kobayashi n 2011 _ physica _ e * 43 * 711 das sarma s , adam s , hwang e h and rossi e 2011 _ rev . mod . phys . _ * 83 * 407              lu c - h , yang h - h , zhu c - l , chen x and chen g - n 2009 _ angew . chem . _ * 48 * 4785 pumera m 2011 _ mater . today _ * 14 * 308 chowdhury r , adhikari s , rees p , wilks s p and scarpa f 2011 _ phys . _ b * 83 * 045401 ;

The authors investigate the spatial current patterns in GNRs, which are determined by the interplay between the GNR's geometry, size, and aspect ratio, as well as the presence of dephasing. They find that the spatial current patterns exhibit coherent and incoherent regions, and that the number of degenerate states participating in the transport affects the current patterns","using the non - equilibrium keldysh green s function formalism , we investigate the local , non - equilibrium charge transport in graphene nanoribbons ( gnrs ) . 
 in particular , we demonstrate that the spatial current patterns associated with discrete transmission resonances sensitively depend on the gnrs geometry , size , and aspect ratio , the location and number of leads , and the presence of dephasing . 
 we identify a relation between the spatial form of the current patterns , and the number of degenerate energy states participating in the charge transport . 
 furthermore , we demonstrate a principle of superposition for the conductance and spatial current patterns in multiple - lead configurations . 
 we demonstrate that scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) can be employed to image spatial current paths in gnr with atomic resolution , providing important insight into the form of local charge transport . 
 finally , we investigate the effects of dephasing on the spatial current patterns , and show that with decreasing dephasing time , the current patterns evolve smoothly from those of a ballistic quantum network to those of classical resistor network .",49220,524,1178,45.67 seconds,2.45 MB,0.4710743801652892,0.27499999999999997,0.32231404958677684,0.8702542185783386,medium
"there are three promising theoretical models to explain the formation of the massive stars : monolithic collapse , competitive accretion , and mergers of low mass stars ( see for a review , zinnecker & yorke 2007 ) . however , their relative large distances ( a few parsecs ) , the clustered formation environments , and their short timescales have made extremely difficult to discard any of these models ( zapata et al . 2015 ) . massive stars have a substantial impact on their surrounding environments , making important contributions to the chemistry enrichment of the interstellar medium ( e.  g. , hernndez - hernndez et al . thus , searching for complex molecules in massive star formation regions is a crucial building block to understand massive star formation , since these molecules can provide information on the physical conditions and evolutionary phases of massive star formation ( herbst & van dishoeck 2009 ) . the w51 north is one of well - studied massive star - forming regions within the luminous cluster w51-irs2 ( zapata , tang & leurini 2010 ) . the distance from w51 north to the sun is approximately 7 kpc ( imai et al . however , a more recent and accurate estimation from xu et al . ( 2009 ) obtained 5.1@xmath3 kpc . a large number of h@xmath1o and oh masers , bright dust emission , outflows , and infalling gas were observed toward w51 north region , indicating that this region is forming indeed massive stars ( downes et al . 1979 ; zhang , ho & ohashi 1998 ; zapata et al . 2008 , 2009 ; zapata , tang & leurini 2010 ) . absence of of centimeter emission suggests that w51 north may represent an extremely early stage of the massive star formation ( downes et al . 1979 ; zhang , ho & ohashi 1998 ) . as the submillimeter array ( sma ) has a broad bandwidth ( 4 ghz , at the time of these observations ) one can detect multiple complex molecules simultaneously , allowing to trace the physical and chemical properties of massive star formation environments close to the massive protostars .    in this paper , we present the results from the sma observations of w51 north region . we have identified 17 species and obtained their physical parameters by the use of xclass program . we describe the observations in  2 . in 3 we present observational results , followed by data analysis in  4 . 5 discusses individual molecules . we summarize the results in  6 . track - sharing observations toward w51 north and w51 main sources were carried out with the sma in 2005 august , using seven antennas in its compact array . the phase - tracking center of w51 north was placed at r.a.= @xmath4 , decl.=@xmath5 ( j2000.0 ) . the typical system temperature of 183 k indicates good weather during observations . the observations covered frequencies from 216.5 to 218.5 ghz ( lower sideband ) , and 226.5 to 228.5 ghz ( upper sideband ) with a frequency resolution of 0.8125 mhz .    the calibration and imaging were done in miriad . bandpass ripples were corrected with the qso 3c454.3 and uranus . we also corrected baseline - based bandpass errors using the qso 3c454.3 . qsos 1741 - 038 and 1749 + 096 were used for phase calibration . uranus was used for flux calibration , and the absolute flux scale is estimated to be accurate to within 20% . continuum subtraction was made in uv domain . self - calibration was performed to the continuum data , and the gain solutions from the continuum were applied to the line data . the synthesized beam sizes of the continuum and line images are approximately 3@xmath6.1@xmath7 2@xmath6.8 ( p.a.@xmath8 ) . 1 @xmath9 rms noises of the continuum and lines are approximately 0.01 jy beam@xmath10 and 0.1 jy beam@xmath10 , respectively . 1 jy beam@xmath10 corresponds to a main beam brightness temperature of 2.7 k. continuum image was constructed from line - free channels of lsb and usb uv data , as shown in figure 1 . the continuum image shows a compact and strong source at the position of w51 north , with an extension to the north , which embraces irs2d source . kjd3 and w51d2 are located east and west of w51 north , respectively ( zapata et al . 2008 ) . two dimension gaussian fits were made to the continuum obtaining the peak intensity and total integrated flux of @xmath11 jy  beam@xmath10 and @xmath12 jy , respectively .    under the assumptions that an average grain radius is 0.1 @xmath13 m , grain density is 3 gr @xmath14 and a gas to dust radio is 100 , the h@xmath1 column density and mass can be calculated by the formula ( lis , carlstrom & keene 1991 ) ,    @xmath15    and    @xmath16    where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are boltzmann constant and planck constant , respectively . t is the dust temperature , q(@xmath19 ) is the grain emissivity at frequency @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the total integrated flux of the continuum and @xmath21 is the solid angle subtended by the source , d is the distance from the source to sun .    the ch@xmath0oh is a grain surface molecule . here , this molecule peaks at the position of the continuum source associated with w51 north ( see figure 3 and discussion is section 5 ) . probably the dust and gas are well coupled through collisions in w51 north region . so we assumed that the dust temperature equals the rotation temperature of 138 k derived from the ch@xmath0oh lines . we adopt @xmath22 at 1.3 mm ( @xmath23 ) ( lis & goldsmith 1990 ; lis , carlstrom & keene 1991 ) . therefore , we obtained a source - averaged h@xmath1 column density of @xmath24 @xmath25 and an h@xmath1 mass of @xmath26 . as the continuum peaks at w51 north , then the mass estimated from peak intensity should correspond to gas mass of w51 north source . the h@xmath1 mass of @xmath27 610 @xmath28 61 @xmath29 is estimated from the continuum peak intensity . a similar result , @xmath27 400@xmath29 was reported by zhang , ho & ohashi ( 1998 ) , in which they calculated the mass of w51 north based on a dust temperature of 100 k , continuum peak intensity of @xmath27 2.0 jy  beam@xmath10 at @xmath30 ghz , d of 7 @xmath27 8 kpc and @xmath31 . if we take @xmath31 , then q(@xmath19 ) @xmath32 at 1.3 mm and then the h@xmath1 mass of @xmath27 535 @xmath28 54@xmath29 is obtained . a dust temperature larger than 100 k suggests that dust grains are not coagulated with ice mantles , and thus @xmath33 @xmath27 1.5 is a reasonable guess in w51 north ( ossenkopf & henning 1994 ) . therefore the difference of mass between ours and @xmath27 400@xmath29 by zhang , ho & ohashi ( 1998 ) may be caused by taking different value of distance , q(@xmath19 ) and uncertain of flux calibration . the lower sideband and upper sideband spectra extracted from the continuum peak position and related with w51 north , are shown as the black curves in figure 2 . a few cn transitions in the usb show absorption features indicating gas infalling onto continuum core ( zapata et al . the sio line in emission is tracing the outflow reported by zapata et al . ( 2009 ) . we identify all the molecular transitions using the xclass program . 84 molecular transitions from 17 species and their isotopologues are identified ( figure 2 ) . in this image the corresponding molecular names are labelled , including oxygen - bearing molecules of ch@xmath0oh , h@xmath1co , c@xmath1h@xmath2oh , ch@xmath0ocho , ch@xmath0och@xmath0 , ch@xmath0coch@xmath0 , nitrogen - bearing molecules of cn , ch@xmath0ch@xmath1cn , hc@xmath0n , ch@xmath1chcn , sulfur - bearing molecules of so@xmath1 , h@xmath1s , sis , and deuterated molecules of dcn and ch@xmath0ccd . the quantum numbers , frequency , @xmath34 and @xmath35 of each transition are summarized in table 1 . column ( 1 ) lists the species and column ( 2 ) lists quantum number , column ( 3 ) , ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) give frequency , s@xmath36@xmath37 and e@xmath38 . the source size @xmath39@xmath7@xmath40 , @xmath41v and @xmath42 are given in column ( 6 ) , ( 7 ) and ( 8) , respectively . figure 3 presents a sample of images from the oxygen- , nitrogen- , and sulfur - bearing molecules , which can provide spatial distribution of specific molecules . in general , all molecular images show a compact structure . the peak emission of the oxygen - bearing molecules of ch@xmath0oh , ch@xmath0coch@xmath0 and ch@xmath0ocho , and nitrogen - bearing molecules of ch@xmath1chcn , ch@xmath0ch@xmath1cn and dcn are coincident with the continuum peak position . the oxygen- and nitrogen - bearing molecules are probably well mixed in space , which imply that they may have same chemical origin ( remijan et al . 2004 ) . while the emission peak of the sulfur - bearing molecules of h@xmath1s , and so@xmath1 are located east of the continuum peak . probably the sulfur - bearing molecules have different chemical routes and form in different environments when compared with the oxygen- and nitrogen - bearing molecules . in addition to the compact source structure , there is an obvious gas extension to the west of the continuum traced by the dcn , h@xmath1s , and sis is observed . [ cols= "" > , < , < , > , > , > , > , > , < "" , ]     from table 2 , the rotation temperatures of oxygen - bearing molecules range from 110 to 140 k , while nitrogen - bearing molecules have rotation temperatures ranging from 105 to 140 k , which is consistent with that derived from the transitions of ch@xmath0cn ( zhang , ho & ohashi 1998 ) . the similar gas temperatures and distributions between oxygen- and nitrogen - bearing molecules ( see  3.3 ) suggest that oxygen - bearing and nitrogen - bearing molecules are well mixed and originate from the same physical environments . the scenario is inconsistent with the observations toward the massive star - forming regions of orion - kl and g19.61 - 0.23 , in which nitrogen - bearing molecules have higher temperatures than oxygen - bearing molecules and oxygen- and nitrogen - bearing molecules peak at different positions ( blake et al . 1987 ; qin et al . the sulfur - bearing molecules have gas temperatures ranging from 130 to 180 k. the sulfur - bearing molecules have been proved to be a probe of outflows or shocks . the outflow motions are identified in w51 north region ( zapata et al . the higher gas temperature of the sulfur - bearing molecules in w51 north may be caused by outflow heating . there are obvious difference in the column densities between the oxygen - bearing and nitrogen - bearing molecules ( see table 2 ) . the column densities of oxygen - bearing molecules range from @xmath43 to @xmath44 @xmath25 . while the column densities of the nitrogen - bearing molecules range from @xmath45 to @xmath46 @xmath25 . the fractional abundance of the observed molecules relative to h@xmath47 are estimated by use of the expression , @xmath48 , and summarized in column ( 4 ) of table 2 , where @xmath49 is column density of specific molecule and @xmath50 is the column density of h@xmath1 . the oxygen - bearing molecules have relatively higher abundances at a range of @xmath51 to @xmath52 , while the nitrogen - bearing molecules have abundances ranging from @xmath53 to @xmath54 . previous observations of massive star - forming regions also showed that the oxygen - bearing molecules have higher abundances but lower temperatures than the nitrogen - bearing molecules ( e.  g. , blake et al . 1987 ; wyrowski et al . 1999 ; qin et al . the chemical model proposed by rodgers & charnley ( 2001 ) suggested that hot - core composition ( o - rich or n - rich ) depends on core temperature and the ammonia / methanol ratio of the evaporated ices , and the timescale of the core formation , in which o - rich cores form first , then become n - rich as temperature rises and evolution . in our case , the oxygen- and nitrogen - bearing molecules peak at same position and have similar temperature , which may be caused by the fact that w51 north is at an early evolutionary stage and the hot core is not very developed , as suggested by dynamical analysis ( zhang , ho & ohashi 1998 ; zapata et al . 2008 , 2009 ; zapata , tang & leurini 2010 ) . the ch@xmath0oh , hc@xmath0n and their isotopologues @xmath55ch@xmath0oh , hcc@xmath55cn are detected in w51 north . @xmath56c/@xmath55c ratios of 21.0 and 23.3 are estimated from ch@xmath0oh/@xmath55ch@xmath0oh and hc@xmath0n / hcc@xmath55cn , respectively . based on the relationship of isotope ratios and distance from the galactic center by willson & rood ( 1994 ) , the @xmath56c/@xmath55c ratio of 22 is obtained if one takes the distance of 1.5 kpc to the galactic center . the consistent @xmath56c/@xmath55c ratio from the two methods suggest that the parameters derived from the xclass modeling are reasonable . methanol ( ch@xmath0oh ) is a key molecule in the chemical networks linked with the formation of more complex oxygen - bearing organic molecules ( bottinelli et al . 2007 ; whittet et al . 2011 ) . five rotational transitions of methanol have been identified in our observations spanning an upper level energies of @xmath57 k. in addition , we have detected two transitions of ch@xmath0oh from vibrational state at frequencies 217.29920 and 217.64286 ghz with upper level energies of 374 and 746 k , respectively . the ch@xmath0oh has highest fractional abundance of @xmath58 than other molecules . higher ch@xmath0oh abundance is also observed in other massive star - forming regions ( e.  g. , qin et al . 2010 , 2015 ; neill et al . 2014 ) . the higher ch@xmath0oh abundance of @xmath59 can not be explained by gas - phase chemical model ( lee , et al . the gas - phase chemical model suggested that ch@xmath0oh can be produced in gas phase via radiative association of ch@xmath60 and h@xmath1o at temperature @xmath61 100 k , giving ch@xmath0oh abundance of @xmath27 @xmath62 ( lee et al . in contrast , the grain chemical model suggested that ch@xmath0oh is formed on grain surface via hydrogenation of co , followed with evaporating from grain surface into gas phase due to temperature increasing , which can produce higher ch@xmath0oh abundances . the higher abundance of @xmath63 in our observations favor that this molecule originates from grain surface chemistry ( charnley et al . 2004 ; garrod & herbst 2006 ) . acetone ( ch@xmath0coch@xmath0 ) had been detected for the first time by combes et al . ( 1987 ) and later confirmed by snyder et al . so far acetone ( ch@xmath0coch@xmath0 ) was only detected in the hot molecular core sgr b2(n ) ( snyder et al . 2002 ) , the orion kl hot core ( friedel et al . 2005 ; peng et al . 2013 ) , and g24.78 + 0.08 ( codella et al . 2013 ) . we have identified 13 transitions of ch@xmath0coch@xmath0 in w51 north region , spanning a wide energy range of @xmath64 k. the column density of @xmath65@xmath25 and gas temperature of 140 k are estimated by use of the xclass , and the higher abundance of @xmath66 is obtained . combes et al . ( 1987 ) proposed that ch@xmath0coch@xmath0 is formed in gas - phase via the radiative association reaction . however herbst , giles & smith ( 1990 ) argued that this radiative association reaction is very inefficient to produce observed ch@xmath0coch@xmath0 abundance , and this process can only explain the lower abundance of @xmath67 . recently , the observations of ch@xmath0coch@xmath0 toward the orion - kl have shown that the distribution of ch@xmath0coch@xmath0 is similar to n - bearing molecules concentrated at the hot core rather than o - bearing molecules peaked at the compact ridge , therefore the formation of ch@xmath0coch@xmath0 may invoke n - bearing molecules , and grain surface chemistry or high temperature gas - phase chemistry may play important roles ( friedel et al . 2005 , 2008 ; peng et al . the well mixed nitrogen- and oxygen - bearing molecules based on gas distributions and temperatures in w51 north indicate that the hot core is not very developed in w51 north and grain surface chemistry and evaporating from grain surface into gas phase may be responsible for the high ch@xmath0coch@xmath0 abundance of @xmath66 , since the gas temperature is not so high in w51 north . compared to the sgr b2(n ) ( snyder et al . 2002 ) , the orion - kl ( peng et al . 2013 ) , and g24.78 + 0.08 ( codella et al . 2013 ) molecule line cores , w51 north region has higher ch@xmath0coch@xmath0 abundance . the ch@xmath0coch@xmath0 can be destructed in gas phase by efficient radiative association of h@xmath60 and ch@xmath0coch@xmath0 or the collisions of ch@xmath0coch@xmath0 and c@xmath68 ( combes et al . 1987 ; herbst , giles & smith 1990 ) . a possible interpretation of higher ch@xmath0coch@xmath0 abundance is that unlike the sgr b2(n ) , the orion - kl , and g24.78 + 0.08 , w51 north is at very early stage of massive star formation , and the ch@xmath0coch@xmath0 is destructed less and converted into the other molecules in a short time . we have identified 13 transitions of c@xmath1h@xmath2oh in w51 north region . these transitions have a wide spread of the upper level energies of @xmath69 k. the c@xmath1h@xmath2oh has higher abundance of @xmath70 in our observations . compared to other sources , the c@xmath1h@xmath2oh abundance of @xmath71 and @xmath72/@xmath73 @xmath74 0.32 are much higher than those in other massive star - forming regions ( ohishi et al . 1995 ; qin et al . 2010 ; bisschop et al . 2007 ) . hence w51 north is a very ethanol - rich source . the gas - phase chemical reaction via ion - molecule reaction predicted c@xmath1h@xmath2oh abundance of @xmath75 ( leung , herbst & huebenr 1984 ) . higher abundance of @xmath70 in our observations ca nt be explained by pure gas - phase chemical model . the grain chemistry suggested that c@xmath1h@xmath2oh can be formed on the grain surface via hydrogenation of ch@xmath0co ( charnley et al . 2004 ; ohishi et al . 1995 ) , and the model predicted high c@xmath1h@xmath2oh abundance of @xmath76 within @xmath27 @xmath77 yr after evaporated from the grain surface into gas phase . our result appears to support that the c@xmath1h@xmath2oh is synthesized on grain surface ( ohishi et al . 1995 ; charnley et al . 1995 ) . four transitions of ch@xmath0och@xmath0 are detected in w51 north . we estimated its rotation temperature of 140 k and column density of @xmath78 @xmath25 from the xclass calculation . the abundance ratio of @xmath79/@xmath72 is approximately 0.24 . the @xmath79/@xmath72 ratios have a great deal of changes from source to source ( fontani et al . 2007 ; qin et al . 2010 ; millar et al . 1988 ; schilke et al . 1997 ; bisschop et al . 2007 ) . although ch@xmath0och@xmath0 is isomer of c@xmath1h@xmath2oh , the abundances of c@xmath1h@xmath2oh and ch@xmath0och@xmath0 are not well correlation , suggesting that they have different chemical route , and do not have same parent molecules . as one of large oxygen - bearing molecules , ch@xmath0ocho has been reported in many hot molecular cores and corinos ( blake et al . 1987 ; hatchell et al . 1998 ; nummelin et al . 2000 ; cazaux et al . 2003 ; bottinelli et al . sixteen transitions of ch@xmath0ocho are identified in w51 north , spanning a upper energy level range of @xmath80 k. high fractional abundance of @xmath81 is obtained . gas temperature , column density and spatial distribution of ch@xmath0ocho are similar to those of ch@xmath0och@xmath0 ( see table 2 and figure 3 ) . similar case is also seen in orion - kl , in which the distributions of ch@xmath0ocho and ch@xmath0och@xmath0 present a striking similarity , and the two species have comparable gas temperature and column density ( brouillet et al . 2013 ) , suggesting that ch@xmath0ocho and ch@xmath0och@xmath0 may be chemically related and have similar formation mechanism ( brouillet et al . 2013 ) . charnley , tielens & millar ( 1992 ) proposed that ch@xmath0och@xmath0 and ch@xmath0ocho can be formed in gas phase chemistry via molecule - ion reaction of ch@xmath0oh@xmath82 with ch@xmath0oh and h@xmath1co , respectively . their model predicted high abundance of @xmath83 for ch@xmath0och@xmath0 and ch@xmath0ocho at age of @xmath84 yr . our results appear to favor the gas - phase formation routes of ch@xmath0och@xmath0 and ch@xmath0ocho by charnley , tielens & millar ( 1992 ) . we have identified 9 ch@xmath1chcn transitions with upper level energies e@xmath38 of @xmath85 k. the column density of @xmath86@xmath25 and the rotation temperature of 140 k are obtained . three ch@xmath0ch@xmath1cn transitions with upper level energies e@xmath38 of @xmath87 k are identified . the column density of @xmath88 @xmath25 and rotation temperature of 140 k are estimated by use of the xclass . ch@xmath1chcn and ch@xmath0ch@xmath1cn have same temperature of 140 k , while ch@xmath0ch@xmath1cn has higher column density than ch@xmath1chcn . previous observations suggested that the abundances of two molecules are strongly correlated ( fontani et al . @xmath89/@xmath90 in w51 north is approximate 0.35 which agrees well with abundance correlation of ch@xmath0ch@xmath1cn and ch@xmath1chcn in other star - forming regions ( fontani et al . 2007 ) and ch@xmath1chcn may be formed through gas phase reactions involving ch@xmath0ch@xmath1cn ( caselli , hasegawa & herbst 1993 ) . while ch@xmath0ch@xmath1cn can be formed by successive hydrogenation of hc@xmath0n on dust grains and released into the gas phase as temperature rises ( blake et al . 1987 ; caselli , hasegawa & herbst 1993 ) . the ratio of @xmath91/@xmath92 @xmath74 10 in our observations is consistent with the model prediction of grain surface chemistry ( blake et al . 1987 ) . we have detected one transition of the deuterated species of hydrogen cyanide ( dcn ) , in w51 north . the column density of @xmath93 @xmath25 is estimated , which is much larger than those in other sources associated with uc hii regions ( hatchell , millar & rodgers 1998 ) . the deuterated species are thought to be synthesized at the early evolutionary stage of star formation ( miettinen , hennemann & linz 2011 ) . previous studies suggested that dcn can be formed via d - h substitution of the hcn or the reaction of chd with n on the grain mantles and then be released into the gas - phase , while dcn can be destroyed with temperature increasing ( schilke et al . 1992 ; hatchell , millar & rodgers 1998 ) . hence the larger abundance observed in w51 north is not a surprise and suggests that it may be synthesized at the early evolutionary stages of star formation . as isotopomer of methyl acetylene ch@xmath1dcch has been reported in the dark cloud tmc-1 cp by gerin et al . ( 1992 ) , and ch@xmath0ccd had been successfully detected in same region by markwick et al . so far the ch@xmath0ccd has been less reported in other massive star formation regions . therefore ch@xmath0ccd is an important molecule for investigating the difference of physical and chemical environments between the dark clouds and hot molecular cores . we have successfully identified 3 transitions of ch@xmath0ccd with e@xmath38 ranging from 78 to 143 k. higher ch@xmath0ccd abundance of @xmath94 and temperature of 130 k compared to dark clouds ( markwick et al . 2005 ) are estimated , which may indicate that ch@xmath0ccd is synthesized on grain surface and release to gas phase as temperature increases . one transition of sis ( j=1211 ) at 217.81766 ghz is identified , and the estimated column density and abundance are @xmath95 @xmath25 and @xmath96 , respectively . so far this species is only detected in carbon star irc+10216 , sgr b2(n ) , sgr b2(m ) and sgr b2(oh ) ( bieging & nguyen 1989 ; turner 1991 ; belloche et al . the column density of @xmath97 @xmath25 is higher than @xmath98@xmath25 in sgr b2 . while the factional abundance of @xmath99 in w51 north is lower than @xmath100 in the carbon star , the abundance difference of four order of magnitude may be caused by the different physical and chemical environments in massive star formation regions and the asymptotic giant branch star . sulfur - bearing molecules of h@xmath1s and so@xmath1 are observed in w51 north , with higher gas temperature than other molecules . the fractional abundances of so@xmath1 and h@xmath1s are @xmath101 and @xmath102 , respectively . the ratio of @xmath103/@xmath104 is appropriately 0.05 , which is same order of magnitude as those in massive protostar cores ( herpin et al . 2009 ) , which is consistent with chemical model that h@xmath1s can be formed on the grain surface and h@xmath1s is converted to so first , then the so is converted to so@xmath1 as temperature rises ( charnley 1997 ; wakelam et al . 2004 ; woods et al . we present the submillimeter array ( sma ) observations of molecular lines in two 2 ghz - wide bands centered at 217.5 and 227.5 ghz , toward massive star forming region w51 north . we identified 84 transitions from 17 species , including oxygen- , nitrogen- and sulfur - bearing molecules . our main conclusions are as follows : + 1 . the gas distributions of both oxygen - bearing and nitrogen - bearing molecules show a compact core concentrated on the strongest continuum source , which indicates that nitrogen- and oxygen - bearing molecules are well - mixed in space in w51 north region . + 2 . under the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium , the molecular rotation temperatures and column densities are estimated by use of the xclass program . the oxygen - bearing molecules have higher fractional abundance than the nitrogen - bearing molecules . the rotation temperatures range from 100 to 200 k , suggesting that the molecular emissions originate from warm environments . thirteen transitions of ch@xmath0coch@xmath0 are identified . higher fractional abundance of ch@xmath0coch@xmath0 are obtained in w51 north when compared to the other massive star - forming regions , _ e.g. _ sgr b2(n ) , orion kl , g24.78 + 0.08 . these results seem to indicate that ch@xmath0coch@xmath0 is synthesized on grain surface at the early evolutionary stage of massive star formation . higher fractional abundance of ch@xmath0oh and c@xmath1h@xmath2oh are obtained , which can not explained by gas phase reactions and the two molecules may be synthesized on grain surface . @xmath105/@xmath106 @xmath74 0.32 are much higher than those in other massive star - forming regions , and w51 north is a very ethanol - rich source . similar gas distribution , rotation temperature and abundance between ch@xmath0ocho and ch@xmath0och@xmath0 suggest that they may be chemically related and have similar formation mechanism . the two molecules may originate from gas phase chemistry . @xmath89/@xmath90 in w51 north agrees well with abundance correlation of ch@xmath107ch@xmath47cn and ch@xmath47chcn in other star - forming regions . ch@xmath107ch@xmath47cn can be formed by successive hydrogenation of hc@xmath107n on dust grains while ch@xmath47chcn may be formed through gas phase reactions involving ch@xmath107ch@xmath47cn . ch@xmath0ccd and sis have been less reported in other star - forming regions . higher fractional abundances of ch@xmath0ccd and sis are estimated in w51 north region . we thank the anonymous referee , and editor morgan hollis for their constructive comments on the paper . this work has been supported by the national natural science foundation of china under grant nos . 11373026 , 11373009 , 11433004 , 11433008 , u1331116 , and the national basic research program of china ( 973 program ) under grant no . 2012cb821800 , by top talents program of yunnan province and midwest universities comprehensive strength promotion project ( xt412001 , yunnan university ) . millar t. j. , brown p. d. , olofsson h. , hjalmarson a. , 1988 , a&a , 205 , l5 mller , t. , endres , c. , & schilke , p. 2015 , accepted by a&a mller h. s. p. , schlder f. , stutzki j. , winnewisser g. , 2005 , jmost , 742 , 215","**Summary of the Text:**

The text discusses the formation of massive stars and their surrounding environments. The authors present three theoretical models for the formation of massive stars: monolithic collapse, competitive accretion, and mergers of low-mass stars. However, these models have limitations, such as their large distances, clustered formation environments, and short timescales. The authors also note that massive stars have a significant impact on their surrounding environments, contributing to the chemistry enrichment of the interstellar medium.

","we present submillimeter array ( sma ) molecular line observations in two 2 ghz - wide bands centered at 217.5 and 227.5 ghz , toward the massive star forming region w51 north . 
 we identified 84 molecular line transitions from 17 species and their isotopologues . 
 the molecular gas distribution of these lines mainly peaks in the continuum position of w51 north , and has a small tail extending to the west , probably associated with w51 d2 . 
 in addition to the commonly detected nitrogen and oxygen - bearing species , we detected a large amount of transitions of the acetone ( ch@xmath0coch@xmath0 ) and methyl formate ( ch@xmath0ocho ) , which may suggest that these molecules are present in an early evolutionary stage of the massive stars . 
 we also found that w51 north is an ethanol - rich source . 
 there is no obvious difference in the molecular gas distributions between the oxygen - bearing and nitrogen - bearing molecules . under the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) , with the xclass tool , the molecular column densities , and rotation temperatures are estimated . 
 we found that the oxygen - bearing molecules have considerable higher column densities and fractional abundances than the nitrogen - bearing molecules . 
 the rotation temperatures range from 100 to 200 k , suggesting that the molecular emission could be originated from a warm environment . finally , based on the gas distributions , fractional abundances and the rotation temperatures , 
 we conclude that ch@xmath0oh , c@xmath1h@xmath2oh , ch@xmath0coch@xmath0 and ch@xmath0ch@xmath1cn might be synthesized on the grain surface , while gas phase chemistry is responsible for the production of ch@xmath0och@xmath0 , ch@xmath0ocho and ch@xmath1chcn .

"since the first results of the _ kepler _ mission were published , the number of known planet candidates has enlarged tremendously . most _ hot jupiters _ have been found in single planetary systems and it was believed that those kind of giant , close - in planets are not accompanied by other planets ( see e.g. * ? ? ? this result has been obtained analysing 63 _ kepler _ hot jupiter candidates and is in good agreement with inward migration theories of massive outer planets , and planet  planet scattering that could explain the lack of additional close planets in hot jupiter systems . nonetheless , wide companions to hot jupiters have been found , as shown e.g. in @xcite for the hat - p-13 system . one has to state , though , that the formation of hot jupiters is not yet fully understood ( see @xcite and references therein for some formation scenarios , and e.g. @xcite for possible tests ) . recently @xcite reanalysed a larger sample of 159 _ kepler _ candidates and in some cases found dynamically induced _ transit timing variations ( ttvs)_. if the existence of additional planets in hot jupiter systems can be confirmed , planet formation and migration theories can be constrained . since , according to @xcite , there is only a small fraction of hot jupiters believed to be part of a multiplanetary system , it is important to analyse those systems where an additional body is expected . in contrast to e.g. the kepler mission , where a fixed field on the sky is monitored over a long time span , our ongoing study of ttvs in exoplanetary systems only performs follow - up observations of specific promising transiting planets where additional bodies are suspected . the targets are selected by the following criteria :    * the orbital solution of the known transiting planet shows non - zero eccentricity ( though the circularization time - scale is much shorter than the system age ) and/or deviant radial velocity ( rv ) data points  both indicating a perturber . * the brightness of the host star is @xmath6mag to ensure sufficient photometric and timing precision at 1 - 2 m telescopes . * the target location on the sky is visible from the northern hemisphere . * the transit depth is at least 10 mmag to ensure a significant detection at medium - sized , ground - based telescopes . * the target has not been studied intensively for ttv signals before . our observations make use of the yeti network ( young exoplanet transit initiative ; * ? ? ? * ) , a worldwide network of small to medium sized telescopes mostly on the northern hemisphere dedicated to explore transiting planets in young open clusters . this way , we can observe consecutive transits , which are needed to enhance the possibility to model ttvs as described in @xcite , and @xcite . furthermore , we are able to obtain simultaneous transits observations to expose hidden systematics in the transit light curves , like time synchronization errors , or flat fielding errors .    in the past , the transiting exoplanets wasp-12b @xcite , wasp-3b @xcite , wasp-10b @xcite , wasp-14b @xcite and tres-2 ( raetz et al . 2014 , submitted ) have been studied by our group in detail . in most cases , except for wasp-12b , no ttvs could be confirmed . recently , also @xcite claimed to have found possible ttv signals around qatar-1 . however , all possible variations should be treated with reasonable care .    in this project we monitor the transiting exoplanet hat - p-32b . the g0v type @xcite host star hat - p-32 was found to harbour a transiting exoplanet with a period of @xmath7d by @xcite . having a host star brightness of @xmath8mag and a planetary transit depth of @xmath4mmag the sensitivity of medium - sized telescopes is sufficient to achieve high timing precision , therefore it is an optimal target for the yeti telescopes . the rv signal of hat - p-32 is dominated by high jitter of @xmath9ms@xmath10 . @xcite claim that a possible cause of the jitter is the presence of one or more additional planets. @xcite also analysed the rv signature of hat - p-32 and found a long term trend indicating a companion with a minimum mass of @xmath11m@xmath12 at separations of @xmath13au . however , such a companion could not yet explain the short time - scale jitter as seen in the hartman data . besides the circular orbit fit , an eccentric solution with @xmath14 also fits the observed data . though @xcite mention that the probability of a real non - zero eccentricity is only @xmath15 , it could be mimicked or triggered by a second body in the system . thus , hat - p-32b is an ideal candidate for further monitoring to look for transit timing variations induced by a planetary companion . between 2011 october and 2013 january we performed 30 complete and 15 partial transit observations ( see tables  [ tab : h32completeobservations ] and [ tab : h32partialobservations ] ) from 10 different observatories : our own one in jena , as well as from telescopes at torun ( poland ) , trebur ( germany ) , gettysburg and swarthmore ( usa ) , tenerife and sierra nevada ( spain ) , antalya and ankara ( turkey ) , and rozhen ( bulgaria ) mostly throughout the yeti network @xcite . in addition , three literature data points from @xcite , and two observations from @xcite are available . the telescopes and abbreviations used hereafter are summarized in table  [ tab : h32telescopes ] , a short description of each observing site can be found below , sorted by the number of observations .    [ cols=""<,<,<,<,^"",options=""header "" , ]     we presented our observations of hat - p-32b planetary transits obtained during a timespan of 24 months ( 2011 october until 2013 october ) . the data were collected using telescopes all over the world , mainly throughout the yeti network . out of 44 started observations we obtained 24 light curves that could be used for further analysis . 21 light curves have been obtained that could not be used due to different reasons , mostly bad weather . in addition to our data , literature data from @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite were also taken into account ( see fig . [ fig : h32oc ] , [ fig : h32ar ] , [ fig : h32k ] , and [ fig : h32i ] and table  [ tab : fitresults ] ) .    the published system parameters @xmath3 , @xmath2 and @xmath1 from the circular orbit fit of @xcite were confirmed . in case of the semimajor axis over the stellar radius and the inclination , we were able to improve the results due to the number of observations . as for the planet - to - star radius ratio , we did not achieve a better solution for there is a spread in the data making constant fits difficult . in addition , @xcite found an m - dwarf @xmath16 away from hat - p-32 and hence a possible cause for this spread . regarding the transit timing , a redetermination of the planetary ephemeris by @xmath4ms can explain the obtained mid - transit times , although there are still some outliers . of course , having 1@xmath17 error bars , one would expect some of the data points to be off the fit . nevertheless , due to the spread of data seen in the o  c diagram , observations are planned to further monitor hat - p-32b transits using the yeti network . this spread in the order of @xmath5min does not exclude certain system configurations . assuming circular orbits even an earth mass perturber in a mean motion resonance could still produce such a signal . ms would like to thank the referee for the helpful comments on the paper draft . all the participating observatories appreciate the logistic and financial support of their institutions and in particular their technical workshops . ms would also like to thank all participating yeti telescopes for their observations . mmh , jgs , ap , and rn would like to thank the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft ( dfg ) for support in the collaborative research center sonderforschungsbereich sfb  tr  7 `` gravitationswellenastronomie '' . re , mk , and rn would like to thank the dfg for support in the priority programme spp 1385 on the _ first ten million years of the solar system _ in projects ne 515/34 -

The number of known hot Jupiters has increased significantly since the first results were published. Most hot Jupiters have been found in single planetary systems, and it is believed that those systems are not accompanied by other planets. However, wide companions to hot Jupiters have been found, such as in the Hat-P-13 system.

The authors of the study, using the Yeti","we present the results of 45 transit observations obtained for the transiting exoplanet hat - p-32b . 
 the transits have been observed using several telescopes mainly throughout the yeti network . in 25 cases , complete 
 transit light curves with a timing precision better than @xmath0min have been obtained . 
 these light curves have been used to refine the system properties , namely inclination @xmath1 , planet - to - star radius ratio @xmath2 , and the ratio between the semimajor axis and the stellar radius @xmath3 . 
 first analyses by @xcite suggest the existence of a second planet in the system , thus we tried to find an additional body using the transit timing variation ( ttv ) technique . 
 taking also literature data points into account , we can explain all mid - transit times by refining the linear ephemeris by @xmath4ms . 
 thus we can exclude ttv amplitudes of more than @xmath5min .

The hybrid dressed states are used to simulate the behavior of systems with decoherence, which is the loss of quantum coherence due to interactions with the environment.

The text explains that decoherence is the main source of noise in quantum systems, and that it can be suppressed by introducing","a fundamental goal of quantum technologies concerns the exploitation of quantum coherent dynamics for the realisation of novel quantum applications such as quantum computing , quantum simulation , and quantum metrology . 
 a key challenge on the way towards these goals remains the protection of quantum coherent dynamics from environmental noise . 
 here , we propose a concept of hybrid dressed state from a pair of continuously driven systems . 
 it allows sufficiently strong driving fields to suppress the effect of environmental noise , while at the same time being insusceptible to both the amplitude and phase noise in the continuous driving fields . 
 this combination of robust features significantly enhances coherence times under realistic conditions , and at the same time provides new flexibility in hamiltonian engineering that otherwise is not achievable . 
 we demonstrate theoretically applications of our scheme for noise resistant analog quantum simulation in the well studied physical systems of nitrogen - vacancy centers in diamond and of trapped ions . 
 the scheme may also be exploited for quantum computation and quantum metrology .    _ 
 introduction. _ quantum technologies hold the promise for the realisation of a wide variety of applications including quantum computing @xcite , quantum simulation @xcite , quantum metrology @xcite and precision measurements @xcite as well as quantum sensing @xcite to name just a few . 
 this motivates the considerable effort that is being invested in the creation of the technological basis for these devices with the ultimate goal of constructing quantum devices that can outperform their classical counterparts . 
 one of the main obstacles on this path is the effect of noise and decoherence due to interaction with an uncontrolled environment , the effect of which becomes increasingly severe as the number of system components grows . 
 this poses a considerable challenge for achieving the quantum control of such systems while maintaining the quantum coherence of the system . 
 hence noise control is central for the future development of scalable quantum technologies . 
 various theoretical concepts and proposals , e.g. quantum error correction @xcite , decoherence free subspace @xcite , and dynamical decoupling @xcite , have been developed for the suppression or avoidance of quantum decoherence . 
 each of these methods are best suited for specific scenarios . for example 
 , the decoherence free subspace approach is mainly useful in those cases in which noise exhibits a symmetry @xcite , which however is not always the case . 
 one important example among others that suffer from non - collective noise is the nitrogen - vacancy ( nv ) center in diamond @xcite as a promising physical system for quantum information processing and quantum sensing , the noise of which is dominated by the local nuclear and paramagnetic environment . 
 these noise sources exhibit relatively long memory times and thus can be suppressed using continuous driving . 
 this approach however suffers drawbacks for strong driving where intensity and phase fluctuations may become significant @xcite . 
 it is an important observation , that for decoupling fields that are derived from the same source , these fluctuations will be strongly correlated . 
 hence , we propose to exploit this feature by pairing two driven systems into hybrid dressed states . 
 the energy gap arising from continuous driving protects quantum coherence in non - markovian environments and makes it insusceptible to inhomogeneous local environment noise , while the pairing approach makes it robust against the driving fluctuation . in comparison with dynamical decoupling in decoherence free subspace , see e.g. @xcite , the present idea of hybrid dressed state provides new flexibility in the engineering of effective hamiltonian . with detailed numerical studies , 
 we demonstrate that the present scheme can prolong coherence times by more than two orders of magnitude under realistic conditions . 
 we exploit hybrid dressed states to implement quantum gates and quantum simulation with significantly improved fidelity , e.g. using nv centers in diamond , which thus provides a route towards a large - scale reliable quantum simulation . 
 it is also feasible to verify the idea with other physical systems such as trapped ions as will be demonstrated here by detailed simulations .    _ 
 the proposal. _ we start from single two - level systems with the basic hamiltonian @xmath0 where @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) represent pauli operators . 
 the coherence of a two - level system , e.g. nv center in diamond , would inevitably be affected by local environmental noise , such as magnetic field and/or charge fluctuation , which can be described by @xmath3}\sigma_{\alpha}^k$ ] . 
 generally , @xmath4 are independent for different two - level systems . the dressed states induced by a continuous driving field @xmath5 are protected from noise by an energy penalty @xcite , where @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the amplitude and frequency of the resonant driving field respectively . in the interaction picture with respect to @xmath9 , 
 the effective system hamiltonian becomes @xmath10 whose eigenstates @xmath11 can be used to represent a ( simple ) dressed spin-@xmath12 that is protected by the continuous driving as long as the power spectrum of the noise @xmath13 at the frequency @xmath7 is negligible . 
 the phase fluctuations in the continuous driving field have two effects , one to flip the dressed states , which would be suppressed by the energy penalty as well , while the other leads to effective amplitude fluctuations @xcite . 
 the main decoherence source is therefore due to the amplitude fluctuations of continuous driving fields and the residual effect of environment noise due to a finite continuous driving field strength , which causes dephasing of dressed states . 
 it is important to note that if , as is often the case , the decoupling fields are derived from the same source , their fluctuations will be correlated - a feature that we will exploit now . 
 system is carried by a pair of two - level systems ( with ising - like coupling strength @xmath14 ) under continuous driving ( with a rabi frequency @xmath7 ) . * 
 ( b ) * the corresponding energy structure of hybrid dressed states . 
 , width=302 ]    to overcome these challenges and making use of the correlated nature of the driving fluctuations , we propose to use a pair of dressed states to carry one effective spin-@xmath12 , see fig.[fig : model ] , represented by two of the eigenstates of @xmath15 as @xmath16 the states @xmath17 and @xmath18 that represent the hybrid dressed spin-@xmath12 are separated from the other two eigenstates @xmath19 and @xmath20 by an energy gap @xmath21 . 
 the dephasing noise would induce the spin flip as @xmath22 and vice versa , the effect of which on the hybrid dressed spin-@xmath12 can be suppressed by tuning the amplitude of the driving field @xmath7 to sufficiently high values so that the relevant noise power spectra become insignificant . 
 the amplitude fluctuations in the driving field , which are described as @xmath23}\sigma_x^{k}$ ] , would however cause dephasing of the simple dressed spin-@xmath12 as @xmath24}{\left\vert { \uparrow_x } \right\rangle}$ ] and @xmath25}{\left\vert { \downarrow_x } \right\rangle}$ ] . 
 thanks to the correlations in the amplitude fluctuations , the choice of hybrid dressed spin-@xmath12 states , renders the effective spin-@xmath12 instead insusceptible to such fluctuations , because @xmath26}{\left\vert \tilde{\uparrow } \right\rangle}({\left\vert \tilde{\downarrow } \right\rangle})=0 $ ] . 
 this allows us to apply strong driving while being immune to their fluctuations . 
 for the cases of no dynamical decoupling and for simple dressed spin ( simple ds ) with driving fluctuation of @xmath27 . 
 ( b ) the coherence time of hybrid dressed spin ( hybrid ds ) as a function of the driving fluctuation as compared with a simple dressed spin . 
 the other parameters are : the noise amplitude @xmath28 , and the correlation time is @xmath29 , the driving amplitude @xmath30 , and the phase fluctuates in @xmath31$].,width=332 ]    in fig.[fig : lifetime ] , we plot the decay of quantum coherence of hybrid dressed states under environment noise and driving fluctuations . 
 the noise ( fluctuation ) @xmath32 is modeled as an ornstein - uhlenbeck process @xcite with the correlation function @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the noise amplitude and @xmath35 is the noise correlation time . 
 we initially prepare a coherent superposition of two basis states , namely @xmath36 for hybrid dressed spin , and @xmath37 for a simple dressed spin . 
 we characterize quantum coherence by @xmath38 , and define coherence time as @xmath39 when @xmath40 . 
 it can be seen from fig.[fig : lifetime](a ) that the fluctuation of the continuous driving field indeed would severely limit its efficiency . 
 we demonstrate in fig.[fig : lifetime](b ) that hybrid dressed states are very robust against the driving fluctuation and can prolong the coherence time by more than two orders of magnitude even for relatively large amplitude and phase fluctuations . 
 we illustrate the application of this basic principle by considering two spins , such as nv centers in nanodiamonds as well as shallowly implanted nv - centers for sensing applications . 
 we stress that the same principle is applicable for other physical systems where noise is local and strong driving fields are necessary for decoupling the systems from high level noise . with the ability to address individual spins 
 @xcite , we first prepare the initial dressed states @xmath41 with microwave-@xmath42 pulses , where @xmath43 and @xmath44 . 
 we drive both spins with the same rabi frequency and consider the interaction between spins given by @xmath45 , where @xmath46 represent the spin-@xmath12 operator in the subspace spanned by @xmath47 @xcite . the interaction for time 
 @xmath48 evolves the system into @xmath49 . 
 the robustness of hybrid dressed states allows us to measure inter - spin interactions and thus the distance between ( adjacent ) spins with a high precision . 
 this is similar in spirit to the experiment with trapped ions @xcite . 
 there , however , correlated noise dominated while local noise suffered by individual system is always non - collective and needs to be preliminarily addressed by dynamical decoupling . 
 we are thus able to prepare a maximally entangled hybrid dressed state with a very high fidelity , even when the required interaction time significantly exceeds the spin coherence times @xcite . 
 such a robust hybrid dressed state can also be exploited to construct a sensitive gradient magnetometer based on a pair of dressed spins , e.g. a pair of linked nanodiamonds @xcite .    _ 
 tunable coherent coupling and quantum simulation. _ for the purpose of quantum simulation , it is necessary to engineer _ tunable _ coherent interaction between hybrid dressed states . 
 we consider two pairs of spins under continuous driving , that interact with each other via @xmath50 @xcite . with appropriately tuning the amplitude @xmath7 and frequency ( @xmath51 ) of the continuous dressing field , one can obtain the following general form of dressed states 
 @xmath52 and @xmath53 , where @xmath54 . 
 to make the hybrid dressed states robust against noise and driving fluctuation , we introduce continuous decoupling fields with rabi frequencies @xmath55 acting on the simple dressed states @xmath56 , so that the protection part hamiltonian is @xmath57 . assuming @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) 
 , we obtain from the original spin - spin interaction the following effective interaction hamiltonian between two hybrid dressed spin-@xmath12 , which are carried by ( @xmath60 ) and ( @xmath61 ) respectively @xcite , @xmath62 where the pauli operators are written in the basis @xmath63 , and the coupling strength @xmath64 , @xmath65 . 
 this leads to the flexibility in tuning effective spin - spin interactions by controlling the driving parameters . 
 the system hamiltonian written in the basis of hybrid dressed states is @xcite @xmath66 where the effective spin-@xmath12 operators are defined as @xmath67 . 
 the local energy is given by @xmath68 , and the coupling strength is @xmath69 . in the particular case @xmath70 , namely @xmath71 
 , the dressing field also acts the role of dynamical decoupling , thus we have @xmath72 @xcite , which allows to efficiently realize high - fidelity entangling gates between hybrid dressed spins . assuming equal ( intra- and inter- pair ) nearest - neighbor interactions @xmath14 and non - nearest - neighbor couplings as @xmath73 , the effective nearest - neighbor coupling is @xmath74 , while @xmath75 . in fig.[fig : ising - coupling ] , it can be seen that the fidelity of maximal entanglement generation at time @xmath76 is high ( above @xmath77 ) even in the case where the noise / fluctuation is stronger than the coupling strength .    ) under realistic noise and driving fluctuation , with respect to the ideal entangling evolution , remains high for the time while the coherence of individual simple dressed spin ( simple ds ) decays rapidly . * 
 ( b ) * the coherent oscillation of state population during the entangling evolution . the maximally entangled hybrid dressed state is generated at time @xmath76 ( green star ) . 
 the relevant parameters are : the noise amplitude @xmath78 , the driving amplitudes @xmath79 , @xmath80 with a relative fluctuation @xmath81 ; and the nearest - neighbor coupling is @xmath82 ( corresponding to a distance of @xmath83 nm ) . 
 the noise and fluctuation correlation time is @xmath29.,width=321 ]    the generalization of coupling in eq.([eq : effective_coupling ] ) to more two - level systems on a regular lattice , see fig.[fig : ising - model](a ) , e.g. self - assembled nanodiamond lattice @xcite and trapped ion lattice @xcite , thus leads to hybrid dressed states protected robust simulation of quantum ising model @xmath84 . 
 the coherence protection provided by @xmath85 is independent of the parameters of the simulating hamiltonian in @xmath86 . 
 long - range dipolar interaction , namely the interaction @xmath87 for @xmath88 in eq.([eq : hdd_coupling ] ) , should be effectively eliminated , as it would cause the leakage out of the protected subspace . with @xmath89 periodically spatial alternating driving amplitudes ( @xmath90^n$ ] ) for a one - dimensional chain so that @xmath91 , see the inset of fig.[fig : ising - coupling](a ) for the case of @xmath92 , the unwanted interactions can be suppressed up to the @xmath93-neighbor coupling . 
 for example , the residual interaction is @xmath94 with @xmath95 for @xmath96 ( @xmath97 ) scaling long range interactions . 
 analogous techniques can be employed for the general case of two - dimensional lattice . for one - dimensional chain , the effective coupling strength scales as @xmath98 where @xmath99 , see fig.[fig : ising - model](b ) , where @xmath100 is the original interaction range . 
 this enables us to achieve a shorter interaction length that otherwise is not possible @xcite . 
 furthermore , as we mentioned , the dependence of the interaction on the driving basis , see eq.([eq : hdd_coupling ] ) , provide additional flexibility in engineering the simulating hamiltonian parameters . 
 in contrast to the digital fashion of quantum simulation in decoherence free subspace @xcite , the present analog quantum simulation will save precious time in case of simulating a large spin system .     of the index @xmath101 
 is represented by driven two - level systems @xmath102 and @xmath103 . * 
 ( b ) * the effective spin - spin interaction range @xmath104 as a function of the original interaction range @xmath100 . * 
 ( c ) * the spin structure factor @xmath105 with @xmath106 achieved via adiabatic preparation for a one - dimensional eight - site ising chain using hybrid dressed spins ( hybrid ds ) and simple two - level systems ( simple tls ) . 
 the parameters are @xmath107 , @xmath108 with @xmath109 and @xmath110 . , width=325 ]    to show the performance of hybrid dressed states in adiabatic quantum simulation , we calculate the spin structure factor @xmath105 with @xmath106 for a one - dimensional ising chain . in fig.[fig : ising - model ] ( c ) , it can be seen that the transition of the order parameter @xmath111 across the critical point becomes much smoother due to the decoherence effect of noise . 
 one would expect that it will be difficult to observe quantum phase transition as the noise level and/or the system size increases . 
 in contrast , we show in fig.[fig : ising - model](c ) that , the effect of noise and driving fluctuation is much suppressed in a quantum simulator with the same number of hybrid dressed spins . 
 we remark that the present scheme is also feasible for the study of quantum quench dynamics , which has attracted intensive interest recently , as it is related to the fundamental problem of thermalization in closed many - body quantum systems @xcite . 
 in particular , high - fidelity quantum simulation may help to distinguish local thermalization from environment induced equilibrium @xcite . 
 _ experiment implementation. _ the present proposal can be implemented in various physical systems , e.g. nv centers in diamond and trapped ions . for nv centers in diamond , 
 the tunable coherent interactions between hybrid dressed states can be engineered from the natural magnetic dipole - dipole interaction using appropriate microwave drivings @xcite . the proof - of - principle verification of the ideas 
 can also be achieved with trapped ions , in which we can induce the interaction term @xmath112 in the dressed state basis by applying counter - propagating raman beams for generating the detuned red sideband transition , additionally we drive the carrier dressing transition for shielding the magnetic noise @xcite . in order to induce the transverse field for the simulated hamiltonian @xmath113 
 , we can introduce an additional rotated term which transforms the ising coupling to the xxz hamiltonian @xcite . for that purpose 
 , we use the single addressing ability of the focused co - propagating raman beams , to drive the dressed states off resonantly @xcite . the feasibility of this approach is carefully verified by our numerical simulation with realistic experiment parameters @xcite .    _ 
 conclusion. _ in summary , we propose to implement high - fidelity quantum simulation using hybrid dressed state . 
 its key advantage is the possibility for applying strong driving to suppress non - collective environment noise while at the same time the inevitable driving fluctuations are suppressed . 
 additionally , it provides new flexibility in the engineering of tunable coherent coupling . 
 we demonstrate theoretically the applicability of our scheme for noise resistant quantum simulation with nv centers in diamond , but would like to stress that it is sufficiently versatile to apply to a wide variety of physical systems . 
 our simulations show that a proof - of - principle verification is readily achievable with trapped ions under state - of - the - art experiment capability . 
 the method can be naturally combined with a wide range of applications such as quantum metrology / sensing and quantum computing . 
 our work thus contributes a new path towards the development of quantum technologies , in which the effect of decoherence is currently a severe obstacle .    _

"according to a nomenclature that has emerged in various physical and mathematical contexts , one refers to the so - called ter - martirosyan  skornyakov ( henceforth tms ) operators as a distinguished class of quantum hamiltonians for systems of non - relativistic particles with two - body `` _ _ zero - range _ _ '' ( or `` _ _ contact _ _ '' , or `` _ _ point _ _ '' ) interaction . this terminology stems from early works in nuclear physics , where it was the nucleon - nucleon coupling to be initially modelled as a `` contact '' interaction . nowadays the typical experimental realisation is that of ultra - cold atom systems where , by feshbach resonance methods , the two - body scattering length is tuned to a magnitude that exceeds by many orders its nominal value , and the effective range of the interaction shrinks correspondingly to a very small scale , so that to an extremely good approximation the interaction can be considered to be of infinite scattering length and/or zero range . in section [ sec : history_tms ] we will provide a more diffuse context and references . informally speaking , tms hamiltonians are qualified by the two characteristics of acting as the @xmath0-body @xmath1-dimensional _ free _ hamiltonian on functions that are supported _ away _ from the `` coincidence hyperplanes '' @xmath2 , and of having a domain that consists of square - integrable functions @xmath3 , possibly with fermionic or bosonic exchange symmetry , which satisfy specific asymptotics when @xmath4 for some or for all particle couples @xmath5 . this models an interaction supported only on the hyperplanes @xmath2 . it is customary to refer to this ultra - violet asymptotics as the `` _ _ tms condition _ _ '' . the explicit form for the tms condition has various versions ( see , e.g. , , , , , , or below ) , all essentially equivalent to each other . noticeably , such asymptotics emerge from different contexts and languages : on the one side the physical heuristics for an `` effective '' low - energy two - body scattering due to an interaction of very short range , on the other side the mathematical theory of self - adjoint extensions of symmetric operators on hilbert space . this is a fascinating history of reciprocal influence and mutual inspiration between `` early days '' nuclear physics , modern condensed matter physics , and mathematical operator theory and self - adjoint extension theory . section [ sec : history_tms ] below will partially survey it . tms hamiltonians represent the modern operator - theoretic approach to multi - particle quantum systems with two - body point interaction , and have an intimate connection to the alternative approach based on energy quadratic forms . they arise as natural effective models , based on stringent physical heuristics on the behaviour of the many - body wave - function when _ two _ particles come on top of each other . in many circumstances , however , which depend essentially on the mass of the particles and on possible additional symmetries of the system , a formal tms hamiltonian fails to be self - adjoint and each of its self - adjoint extensions accounts for a different behaviour of the system when _ three _ particles get closer and closer to the same point . the question is then to identify these extensions ( if more than one ) and to study their stability and spectral properties . this is even more so since quantum systems with zero - range interactions may exhibit two somewhat exotic phenomena , as compared with the case of ordinary finite range potentials : the so - called `` _ _ thomas effect _ _ '' , namely the emergence of an infinite discrete sequence of bound states with negative energy diverging to @xmath6 and eigenfunction collapsing onto the barycentre , and the `` _ _ efimov effect _ _ '' , that consists of an infinite sequence of bound states with negative energy arbitrarily close to zero and eigenfunctions extending on a larger and larger spatial scale , with a non - square - integrable limit . the tms hamiltonians account for such phenomena as well .    in this work we put the emphasis on the mathematical scheme within which a two - body interaction modelled by means of a tms condition ( a _ physical _ requirement ) does correspond to a self - adjoint hamiltonian ( a _ mathematical _ constraint that ensures the well - posedness and the correct interpretation of the quantum model ) .    here is how the general problem is posed , as we shall elaborate further in the historical review of section [ sec : history_tms ] and then in the concrete settings of sections [ sec:2body - point ] and [ sec:2 + 1 ]    * one starts ( mostly in @xmath7 dimensions ) with the operator @xmath8 obtained by _ restricting _ the @xmath0-body free hamiltonian to the regular wave - functions that are supported away from the coincidence hyperplanes @xmath9 . additional partial or global symmetries for @xmath8 are possible , such as rotational symmetries , or exchange bosonic or fermionic symmetries for some or all of the @xmath0 particles . @xmath8 is clearly densely defined , symmetric , and positive , and any its self - adjoint extension is naturally interpreted as a model for an interaction supported at @xmath10 . * the self - adjoint extensions of @xmath8 are restrictions of @xmath11 . thus , one first characterises the domain and the action of @xmath11 and then one selects a special class of restrictions of @xmath11 , which are obtained by reducing the domain of @xmath11 to only those functions @xmath12 satisfying , for some or all couples of variables @xmath13 , the condition that , if @xmath14 and @xmath15 is a regular change of variables , then @xmath16 in @xmath17 are the conjugate fourier variables to @xmath18 , the function @xmath19 depends on @xmath12 and on the considered couple @xmath5 , but not on @xmath20 , and the constant @xmath21 is prescribed and is @xmath20-independent too . equation above is one version of the so - called ter - martirosyan  skornyakov condition . it is based on stringent physical heuristics ( see the discussion in section [ sec : history_tms ] and - below ) that allow one to interpret it as an interaction in the @xmath22-channel with _ zero range _ and @xmath23-wave scattering length equal to @xmath24 . * the tms condition selects a `` physical '' extension @xmath25 of @xmath8 labelled by the conventional parametrisation @xmath26 . the mathematical problem is then to recognise @xmath25 as a self - adjoint extension of @xmath8 , or to identify and classify its self - adjoint extensions , and then to investigate its spectral and stability properties . the scheme above , which was made explicit for the first time by minlos @xcite in 1987 ( based on an old seminal but very concise work of minlos and faddeev @xcite in 1961 ) , has been since then the object of numerous investigations that we will quote in section [ sec : history_tms ] the general question of the self - adjoint realisation of @xmath25 and of its stability and spectral properties is still open . an amount of partial information is available for special cases of @xmath0-body systems .    in this work , beyond placing the problem into a historical perspective ( see section [ sec : history_tms ] ) , we discuss how the tms condition can be proved to be a _ self - adjointness condition _ , based on the extension theory specifically tailored for semi - bounded symmetric operators , as developed by kren , viik , and birman . ( we review the main results of this theory in appendix [ app : kvb ] and we refer to @xcite for a comprehensive discussion . )    the use of the kren - viik - birman theory is in fact at the basis of all recent studies on the self - adjoint realisation of the operator @xmath25 selected by the tms condition : in this context , it allows one to reduce the problem of the self - adjointness of @xmath25 on the hilbert space @xmath27 ( with possible symmetries ) to the problem of the self - adjointness of a suitable integral operator on the space of the functions @xmath19 s appearing in the asymptotics . what we do here is on the first place to elaborate in full detail the precise application of the kren - viik - birman theory to the tms condition , with a discussion and through intermediate results that to our knowledge are not present in the literature . further , we put for the first time the emphasis on the crucial difference between the tms condition as a _ point - wise _ identity , and the same condition interpreted as a suitable _ functional _ identity , as we now explain .    in section [ sec:2body - point ] , which contains the first group of our results , we discuss the tms condition for the simplest composite system possible , consisting of two particles with point interaction . this is a well - studied quantum system that is completely understood within the standard self - adjoint extension theory a la von neumann . first we re - obtain the well - known hamiltonian of the system solely by means of the kren - viik - birman theory , a procedure that we did not manage to find elsewhere in the literature . this yields an alternative equivalent characterisation of the whole class of self - adjoint extensions of the `` away - from - hyperplanes '' free hamiltonian @xmath8 that represented the starting point of the analysis  see step 1 of the general scheme above . we then show that imposing the tms condition to functions in the domain of @xmath11 reproduces , for all possible values of the scattering length @xmath28 , _ all _ the self - adjoint extensions of @xmath8 . in particular this shows that the tms condition is a self - adjointness condition .    in section [ sec:2 + 1 ] , where the second group of our results is presented , we follow the same approach for a more complicated system consisting of three particles with point interaction  we develop our explicit discussion for the so - called `` 2 + 1''-fermionic system , two identical fermions coupled with a third particle of different nature . exploiting again the general results of the kren - viik - birman theory , we find that the tms condition is a self - adjointness condition , which selects a sub - class of extensions of @xmath11 , only if it is given as a suitable functional identity . as a generic point - wise identity , instead , the tms condition is in general not even a condition for a symmetric extension of @xmath8 . furthermore , we show that the issue of the self - adjoint realisation of the tms condition does indeed boil down to the self - adjointness problem of a simpler integral operator ( that acts on the so - called `` space of charges '' ) as normally given for granted in the literature , _ but _ on different ( more regular ) functional spaces than those considered so far . this brings us to the natural follow - up of the present analysis , which was in fact our original motivation and that we intend now to develop in a future work . there are indeed not completely understood discrepancies in the literature between the ranges of the particle masses in which the tms condition for three - body systems is shown to be a self - adjointness condition , or instead to give rise to a symmetric extension of @xmath8 with its own family of self - adjoint extensions . such discrepancies emerge between the operator - theoretic approach sketched above and an alternative approach through quadratic forms ( i.e. , the construction of a closed and semi - bounded quadratic form such that the function in the domain of self - adjoint operator that realises it display the tms asymptotics ) . re - visiting the operator - theoretic approach in view of our present findings is likely to account for an explanation . we briefly elaborate on this point in the final section [ sec : developments ] in this section we present the historical emergence of tms operators in the physics and mathematics of point interactions . it therefore should _ not _ be regarded as a complete review on the history of point interactions !    in the 1930 s quantum mechanics began to be applied to the newly observed nuclear phenomena . at first , the decrease by a factor @xmath29 from the atomic to the nuclear scale made it plausible to model the interaction among nucleons as a delta - like interaction .    in 1932 wigner @xcite calculated that the nuclear forces interaction must be of very short range and very strong magnitude . this led three years later first bethe and peierls @xcite and then thomas @xcite to describe the neutron - proton scattering by means of the two - body schrdinger equation in the approximation of a potential of very short range , an approach subsequently developed by fermi @xcite and breit @xcite with the introduction of the so - called `` delta pseudo - potential '' . formulated in modern terms , the celebrated `` _ _ bethe - peierls contact condition _ _ '' , which is still today ubiquitous in many formal physical treatments , prescribes on the basis of physical heuristics that the wave - function @xmath3 of @xmath0 three - dimensional particles subject to a two - body zero - range interaction of scattering length @xmath30 among particles @xmath31 and @xmath32 behaves asymptotically as @xmath33 where the point - wise limit is meant as @xmath34 for some function @xmath35 of the variable @xmath36 in the hyperplane @xmath2 . clearly , what makes this approximation appealing , and computationally advantageous , is its dependence on few parameters only ( the @xmath30 s ) , instead of the complete knowledge of the interaction . while bethe and peierls had studied the problem of _ two _ low - energy nucleons with contact interaction and obtained for the two - body problem , thomas had considered the _ three - body _ problem showing that as the range of the two - body forces tends to zero the ground state of the three - body system can approach @xmath6 , even when the ground state energies of all two - body subsystems remain constant . this effect , referred to since then as the `` _ _ thomas effect _ _ '' , was the first evidence that the deceptively simple three - body problem with zero - range interaction has a much richer ( and potentially much more complicated ) phenomenology than the analogous two - body problem . the next extensive study of a system of _ three _ low - energy nucleons appeared some 20 years later , in 1955 , due to ter - martirosyan and skornyakov @xcite , two nuclear physicists who credited landau for the ideas they exploited . they assumed that the bethe - peierls condition remains valid in _ each _ two - body channel and they used it as boundary condition for solving the eigenvalue problem for the three - body schrdinger equation with formal delta - like two - body potentials . for brevity let us revisit their conclusion in the simplest case of spinless identical particles , for which they made use of standard centre - of - mass jacobi coordinates @xmath37 , @xmath38 and introduced a formal delta - like potential @xmath39 for wave - functions @xmath40 . by suitably expressing @xmath41 in terms of an auxiliary function @xmath42 ( here @xmath43 and @xmath44 are fourier conjugate variables ) , they found that ( in units @xmath45 and particle mass @xmath46 ) @xmath12 is a bound state of energy @xmath47 whenever @xmath48 is a solution to the integral equation @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath28 is the @xmath23-wave scattering length in each two - body channel . analogues to equation were later found for other systems with point interactions , among which , to mention those that have received the largest attention , three - body systems with different symmetries ( three distinguishable particles , two identical fermions plus a third particle of different nature , etc . ) , four - body systems with two distinct couples of identical fermions , and more generally @xmath51 systems with @xmath0 identical fermions of one type plus @xmath52 identical fermions of another type . each equation of this class is today referred to as a `` _ _ ter - martirosyan  skornyakov equation _ _ '' . the subject proved soon to be worth a deeper understanding , despite the effectiveness of the description . on the one hand the manipulations of ter - martirosyan and skornyakov ( as well as the previous ones by bethe , peierls , thomas , fermi , and breit ) were rather formal for mathematical standards and called for a more rigorous justification . on the other hand , an evidence of some sort of indeterminate physical description emerged when danilov @xcite in 1961 observed that the tms equation has a solution @xmath53 for arbitrary values of @xmath54 , with large momentum asymptotics @xmath55 where @xmath56 is an explicit universal constant and @xmath57 are two further constants that depend on @xmath54 . inspired by ideas ( mainly of gribov ) by which some additional `` experimental '' parameter that can not be computed using only two - body experimental data was needed for the full description of the three - body system , danilov proposed an ad hoc removal of this non - physical continuum of eigenvalues on @xmath58 by constraining the solutions to to have the form with @xmath59 for some additionally prescribed parameter @xmath60 . @xmath61 was in some vague sense given the meaning of a three - body parameter , as opposite to @xmath62 in which is a parameter of the two - body problem for each couple of bosons . under the restriction , equation has a discrete and infinite set of solutions @xmath63 , with energies @xmath64 as @xmath65 according to the asymptotics @xmath66 a quantitative manifestation of the thomas effect .    in modern mathematical terms , the phenomenon noted by danilov is understood as follows : the three - body point - interaction hamiltonian implicitly identified by ter - martirosyan and skornyakov by means of the condition for its eigenstates at given two - body scattering length @xmath67 , is _ not _ a self - adjoint operator and it admits a one - parameter family of self - adjoint extensions , labelled by @xmath60 ; for each @xmath61 , the corresponding self - adjoint hamiltonian has a countable discrete spectrum accumulating exponentially to @xmath6 with corresponding eigenfunctions that collapse onto the barycentre ; the union of the negative spectra of all such self - adjoint extensions is the whole negative real line .    motivated by the scheme of ter - martirosyan and skornyakov for the three - body problem with point interaction and by danilov s observation , minlos and faddeev @xcite in the same year 1961 provided essentially the whole explanation above , including the asymptotics and , in the form of two beautiful short announcements , albeit with no proofs or further elaborations . theirs can be considered as the beginning of the mathematics of quantum systems with zero - range interactions . this is even more so because for the first time the problem was placed within a general mathematical framework , the theory of self - adjoint extensions of semi - bounded symmetric operator , that kren , viik , and birman had developed between the mid 1940 s and the mid 1950 s ( see appendix [ app : kvb ] ) . a somewhat different approach characterised the start of the mathematical study of the _ two - body _ problem . in 1960 - 1961 , a few months before the works of minlos and faddeev on the three - body problem , berezin and faddeev @xcite published the first rigorous analysis of a three - dimensional model with two particles coupled by a delta - like interaction . the emphasis was put in realising the formal hamiltonian @xmath68 as a self - adjoint extension of the restriction @xmath69 ( in the relative variable @xmath70 between the two particles ) . working in fourier transform , they recognised that the latter operator has deficiency indices @xmath71 and they characterised the whole family @xmath72 of its self - adjoint extensions as the operators @xmath73 defined on the domain of @xmath74-functions @xmath75 such that , as @xmath76 , @xmath77 ( for a more direct comparison  see in the following  we have replaced here the parameter @xmath62 of the notation of @xcite with @xmath78 . )    as - were only announced with no derivation , with a sole reference to the monograph @xcite of akhiezer and glazman on linear operators in hilbert space , we are to understand that berezin and faddeev came to their conclusion by methods of von neumann s self - adjoint extension theory , as presented in ( * ? ? ? * chapter vii ) , combined with explicit calculations in fourier transform . this leaves the question open on why they did not approach the extension problem within the same language of kren , viik , and birman , as used by minlos and faddeev for the three - body case . in this language , as we work out in section [ sec:2body - point ] , - would have emerged as a very clean application of the general theory and , most importantly , the asymptotics in would have arisen with a natural and intimate connection with the tms equation . berezin and faddeev rather focused on re - interpreting the action of the hamiltonian @xmath25 as a renormalised rank - one perturbation of the free laplacian , re - writing in position coordinates as @xmath79 we conjecture that they did not know the old work of bethe and peierls for two nucleons , or they did not consider it relevant in their context , for no word is spent in @xcite to derive the singularity @xmath80 as @xmath81 from their asymptotics .    with the subsequent theoretical and experimental advances in nuclear physics  the initial playground for models of point interactions it became clear that the assumption of zero range was only a crude simplification of no fundamental level . the lack of a physically stringent character for the idealisation of zero range in experimentally observed quantum - mechanical systems , and the somewhat obscure emergence of the unboundedness from below for the self - adjoint realisations of the three - body hamiltonian , decreased the physical interest towards point interactions and left their rigorous study in a relatively marginal position , and the approach of ter - martirosyan and skornyakov quiescent . moreover , after faddeev published in 1963 his fundamental work @xcite on the three - body problem with regular two - body forces , the concern of the physicists switched over to the numerical solutions of the corresponding faddeev equations . in the russian physical literature , mainly under the input of faddeev , methods and models of point interactions , albeit not fully rigorous , moved their applicability to atomic and molecular physics , a mainstream that ideally culminates with the late 1970 s monograph of demkov and ostrovskii @xcite on the `` zero - range potentials '' and their application to atomic physics . the use of formal delta - like potentials remained for some decades as a tool for a formal first - order perturbation theory ; in addition , the kren - viik - birman self - adjoint extension theory lost ground to von neumann s theory in the literature in english language on the mathematics for quantum mechanics it rather evolved in more modern forms in application to boundary value problems for partial differential equations , mainly in the modern theory of boundary triplets . it is the merit of albeverio , gesztesy , and hegh - krohn , and their collaborators ( among whom , streit and wu ) , in the end of the 1970 s and throughout the 1980 s , to have unified an amount of previous investigations by establishing a proper mathematical branch on rigorous models of point interactions , with a systematic study of _ two - body _ hamiltonians and of _ one - body _ hamiltonians with finite or infinitely many _ fixed centers _ of point interaction . we refer to the monograph @xcite for a comprehensive overview on this production , and especially to the end - of - chapter notes in @xcite for a detailed account of the previous contributions . the main tools in this new mainstream were : von neumann s extension theory on the first place ( hence with no reference any longer to the methods of kren - viik - birman ) , by which point interaction hamiltonians were constructed as self - adjoint extensions of the restriction of the free laplacian to functions that vanish in a neighbourhood of the point where the interaction is supported ; resolvent identities ( of kren and of konno - kuroda type , see ( * ? ? ? * appendices a and b ) ) by which these self - adjoint extensions were recognised to be finite - rank perturbations of the free laplacian , in the resolvent sense , and were also re - obtained by resolvent limits of schrdinger hamiltonians with shrinking potentials ; plus an amount of additional methods ( dirichlet quadratic forms , non - standard analysis methods , renormalisation methods ) for specific problems . let us emphasize , in particular , that the original heuristic arguments of bethe and peierls and their two - body contact condition find a rigorous ground based on the fact , which can be proved within von neumann s extension theory ( see , e.g. , ( * ? ? ? * theorems i.1.1.1 and i.1.1.3 ) ) , that any self - adjoint extension of @xmath82 on @xmath74 has a domain whose elements behave as @xmath83 as @xmath81 , as an @xmath23-wave ( hence a `` low - energy '' ) boundary conditions , for some @xmath84 $ ] .    as for the initial three - body problem with two - body point interaction , it finally re - gained centrality from the mathematical point of view ( while physically a stringent experimental counterpart was still lacking ) around the end of the 1980 s and throughout the 1990 s . this was first due to minlos and his school @xcite ( among which melnikov , mogilner , and shermatov ) , by means of the operator - theoretic approach used for three identical bosons by minlos and faddeev , and slightly later due to dellantonio and his school @xcite ( among which figari and teta ) , with an approach based on quadratic forms , where the `` physical '' energy form is first regularised by means of an ultra - violet cut - off and a suitable renormalisation procedure , and then is shown to be realised by a self - adjoint hamiltonian . an alternative direction was started further later by pavlov and a school that included kuperin , makarov , melezhik , merkuriev , and motovilov , @xcite , by indroducing internal degrees of freedom , i.e. , a spin - spin contact interaction , so as to realise semi - bounded below three - body hamiltonians .    after a further period of relative quiescence , the subject has been experiencing a new boost , due to the last decade s rapid progress in the manipulation techniques for ultra - cold atoms and , in particular , for tuning the effective @xmath23-wave scattering length by means of a magnetically induced feshbach resonance ( * ? ? ? * section 5.4.2 ) . this has made it possible , among others , to prepare and study ultra - cold gases in the so - called `` _ _ unitary regime _ @xcite , i.e. , the case of negligible two - body interaction range and huge , virtually infinite , two - body scattering length ( both lengths being compared to a standard reference length such as the bohr radius ) . in such a regime , unitary gases show properties , including superfluidity , that have the remarkable feature of being universal in several respects @xcite , and are under active experimental and theoretical investigation . as we do not have space here for an outlook on such an active field , we refer to the overview given in the introductory sections of the works @xcite and to the references therein . let us only underline that from the experimental point of view , zero - range interactions in ultra - cold atom physics are today far from being just an idealisation of real - world two - body potentials with small support and in many realisations the zero - range , delta - like character of the interaction turns out to be an extremely realistic and in fact an unavoidable description .    in turn , all this has brought new impulse and motivations to the already developing mathematical research on the subject , with a series of fundamental contributions in the last few years @xcite , many of which provide rigorous ground to experimental or numerical evidence on the physical side . the hamiltonian of point interaction between two particles in three dimension is well known since the first rigorous attempt @xcite by berezin and faddeev in 1961 , which we have already mentioned in section [ sec : history_tms ] , and the seminal work @xcite by albeverio and hegh - krohn in 1981 . in ( * ? ? ? * chapter i.1 ) one can find the complete discussion of the self - adjoint realisation of this operator , its explicit domain and action , its resolvent , its spectral properties , its approximation by short - range potentials , and its scattering theory . in the first part of this section we shall re - obtain this hamiltonian and its main properties within the self - adjoint extension scheme of kren - viik - birman , as opposite to von neumann s scheme used in the above works . we follow this line both for general reference , because to our knowledge this approach has never been worked out in the literature , and above all because we need to establish the grounds for the second part of this section , where we shall realise the point interaction  la ter - martirosyan  skornyakov . for the tools from the kren - viik - birman theory we shall make use of , we refer to the appendix [ app : kvb ] and , more diffusely , to the work @xcite . the starting point is the operator @xmath85 which is clearly a densely defined , symmetric , closed , and positive operator on the hilbert space @xmath74 . the variable @xmath86 has the meaning of relative variable between the two particles : after removing the centre of mass of the two - body system , the only relevant problem is in the relative variable . @xmath8 is the closure of the negative laplacian restricted to the smooth functions compactly supported away from the origin , and @xmath87 the space above is clearly a closed subspace of @xmath88 , and it is also proper , as shown in and below . the free hamiltonian on @xmath89 is the natural starting point when one aims at constructing a singular interaction supported only at @xmath90 , and any self - adjoint extension of this operator has the natural interpretation of a `` candidate '' hamiltonian for the point interaction .    throughout this discussion it will be convenient to work in fourier transform . we therefore re - write by means of the following simple lemma :    lemma[lemma : dom_hdot_ftransform ] for the operator @xmath8 defined in one has    * the domain and the action of @xmath8 are given by @xmath91 * the friedrichs extension of @xmath8 is given by @xmath92    by suitable approximation arguments ( see appendix [ app : approx ] ) , we have @xmath93 moreover , since @xmath94 and @xmath95 are in @xmath74 , then @xmath96 . hence @xmath97 which , together with @xmath98 , proves part ( i ) . as for part ( ii ) , we first observe that the form domain of @xmath8 , which is the completion of @xmath99 in the @xmath100-norm , is precisely @xmath101\;=\overline{\,h^2_0(\mathbb{r}^3\!\setminus\!\{0\})\;}^{\,\|\,\|_{h^2}}=\;\;h^1_0({\mathbb{r}}^3\!\setminus\!\{0\})\,.\ ] ] since @xmath102 ( see appendix [ app : inclusions ] ) and @xmath103 is the domain of a self - adjoint extension of @xmath8 , namely the self - adjoint @xmath104 on @xmath105 , we conclude that @xmath104 must be the friedrichs extension @xmath106 of @xmath8 , owing to the characterisation of @xmath106 as the unique self - adjoint extension of @xmath8 whose operator domain is contained in @xmath107 $ ] . as every semi - bounded and densely defined symmetric operator , @xmath8 admits self - adjoint extensions . we are after the family of such extensions . the first step is to determine the adjoint of @xmath8 . proposition[prop : d_hdostar ] let @xmath108 . * one has @xmath109 * the domain and the action of the adjoint of @xmath8 are given by @xmath110    remark the decomposition of the generic element @xmath111 depends on the chosen @xmath112 , but of course @xmath113 does not , nor does the outcome of @xmath11 applied to @xmath114 , as one sees from .    in order to apply the general decomposition formulas of lemma [ lemma : krein_decomp_formula ] we need to deal with an operator with positive bottom . to this aim we introduce the auxiliary operator @xmath115 which is by construction densely defined , symmetric , and closed , and with bottom @xmath116 . clearly , @xmath117 and @xmath118 . since @xmath119 , then @xmath120 if and only if @xmath121 which by and a standard localisation argument yields . because of @xmath122 and , we have that @xmath123 this , together with the decomposition formula discussed in appendix [ app : kvb ] ( lemma [ lemma : krein_decomp_formula ] ) , and the characterisation of @xmath124 yield immediately . the decomposition also implies that the action of @xmath125 on a generic element @xmath126 is the same as the action of @xmath127 on the component @xmath128 , while @xmath129 : this is precisely . as for , it follows directly from and . remark the decomposition formula , together with above , gives @xmath130 therefore , expression shows that a generic @xmath111 is in general less regular than @xmath103 , for only the component @xmath131 is in @xmath132 , whereas the component @xmath133 is not . related to that , shows that whereas @xmath134 , none of the two _ distributions _ @xmath135 and @xmath136 whose difference gives precisely @xmath137 is realised as a square - integrable function ( thus , in the difference the two non - square - integrable singularities cancel out ) .    with the above knowledge of @xmath138 and @xmath139 the kren - viik - birman theory provides an explicit prescription to restrict @xmath125 so as to find the whole family of self - adjoint extensions of @xmath140 , and hence of @xmath8 . theorem[thm:1p1_extensions_birman ]     * the self - adjoint extensions of the operator @xmath8 on @xmath74 constitute the one - parameter family @xmath141 where @xmath142 is the friedrichs extension @xmath106 , that is , @xmath143 whereas , for @xmath144 , @xmath145 where @xmath108 is arbitrary . * each extension @xmath146 is semi -

square - integrable ) part @xmath202 which is _ cancelled _ in the difference in the r.h.s .  of . this is consistent with above , where formally ( as @xmath192 ) one obtains a distributional contribution in @xmath135 given by @xmath203 , which is precisely a @xmath200-distribution . the cancellation occurring in the r.h.s . of can be regarded as the _ renormalisation _ of @xmath135 needed to give meaning to @xmath204 when @xmath161 . in remark [ rem : renormalis2 ] below we shall complete this comment by showing that expresses the very same normalisation announced by berezin and faddeev .      the functions in @xmath113 have the following asymptotic behaviour . lemma[lemma : asymptotic_integral ] let @xmath114 be an arbitrary function in @xmath113 . for a fixed @xmath108 let @xmath205 be the decomposition of @xmath114 obtained in proposition [ prop : d_hdostar ] for some @xmath163 and some @xmath206 . then @xmath207    owing to lemma [ lemma : dom_hdot_ftransform ] , equation , @xmath208 as @xmath76 , so this integral is a @xmath209 contribution in . as for the two other summands in the decomposition of @xmath179 , we have @xmath210 and @xmath211 which complete the computation of the r.h.s .  of . one _ defines _ the tms extension @xmath212 of @xmath8 , @xmath213 , to be the restriction of @xmath11 to those @xmath114 s of @xmath113 for which in the asymptotics the coefficients of the @xmath214 term and of the @xmath215 term are proportional by a factor @xmath62 , more precisely @xmath216 thus , @xmath217 consists of all @xmath114 s of @xmath113 for which @xmath218 both and express a _ tms condition _ ; it is a constraint on the singular part of the @xmath114 s of @xmath113 that restricts the choice of @xmath219 to those such that @xmath220    condition above is precisely of the form @xmath221 with @xmath222 owing to of theorem [ thm:1p1_extensions_birman ] , this implies at once that the operator @xmath212 selected by the tms condition -- above is precisely the self - adjoint extension @xmath146 of @xmath8 qualified by the parameter @xmath184 given by in terms of @xmath62 . we also observe that is the inverse of : therefore , by what recalled in remark [ rem : htau_halpha ] , the tms extension @xmath212 models a two - body point interaction with @xmath23-wave scattering length equal to @xmath187 . thus ,    * imposing the tms condition on @xmath11 with parameter @xmath62 produces the self - adjoint extension of @xmath8 that gives the point interaction with scattering length @xmath187 ; * the collection of all the tms extensions obtained this way cover the whole family of self - adjoint extensions of @xmath8 : _ all self - adjoint extensions of @xmath8 are of tms type_.    remark[rem : renormalis2 ] with the analysis of this subsection we can supplement remark [ rem : renormalis1 ] above with the following observation . first , one recognises that the condition identified by berezin and faddeev for each self - adjoint extension of @xmath8 is precisely of the tms form . furthermore , the asymptotics shows that for each @xmath223 the corresponding charge @xmath35 is given by @xmath224 which plugged into yields @xmath225 this is exactly the property announced by berezin and faddeev , and it is the fourier - transformed version of the identity that expresses @xmath226 by means of a suitable renormalisation of @xmath135 . as discussed in section [ sec : history_tms ] , the problem of a three - particle quantum system with two - body point interaction has been studied since long . however , one still has a relatively limited knowledge of the corresponding hamiltonians , primarily their self - adjoint realisation ( whereas the information on their stability and spectral properties is only partial ) . the novel difficulty , as opposed to the two - body case , is due to the fact that the ter - martirosyan  skornyakov condition does not select in general a domain of self - adjointness , and one has to further study the self - adjoint extension of the resulting tms operator . we restrict our discussion to the most studied case , that of two identical fermions in interaction with a third particle of different nature ( the so called `` _ _ 2 + 1 fermionic system _ _ '' ) .      after removing the centre of mass , the free hamiltonian of a three - dimensional system of two identical fermions of unit mass in relative positions @xmath227 with respect to a third particle of different species and with mass @xmath228 is the operator @xmath229 acting on the hilbert space @xmath230 the subscript ` f ' standing for the fermionic sector of the @xmath201-space , i.e , the square - integrable functions that are anti - symmetric under exchange @xmath231 . following the same path as in subsection [ subsec:2delta ] , one therefore starts with the operator @xmath232 where @xmath233 and @xmath234    @xmath8 is a densely defined , closed , positive , and symmetric operator on @xmath235 . as such , @xmath8 has equal deficiency indices , and in proposition [ prop : d_hdostar_2 + 1 ] below we shall see that they are infinite . any self - adjoint extension of @xmath8 has a natural interpretation of hamiltonian of point interaction between each fermion and the third particle . it is convenient first to characterise @xmath99 in fourier transform . lemma[lemma : dom_hdot_ftransform_2 + 1 ]     * the domain of @xmath8 is given by @xmath236 where @xmath237 and the duality product is meant between the spaces @xmath238 and @xmath239 . the action of @xmath8 is given by @xmath240 where @xmath241 in other words , @xmath99 consists of the @xmath242-functions @xmath243 such that @xmath244 in @xmath245 , where @xmath246 , and @xmath8 acts on such @xmath243 s as the free two - body ( negative ) laplacian . * the friedrichs extension of @xmath8 is given by @xmath247    clearly , for @xmath246 one has @xmath248 , where @xmath249 and @xmath250 is the hyperplane @xmath251 . for a generic @xmath252 a standard trace theorem ( * ? ? ? * lemma 16.1 ) asserts that @xmath253 , and if in addition @xmath254 , then @xmath255 . thus , by repeated application of the trace theorem to a function @xmath256 , one finds @xmath257 in @xmath258 . summarising , @xmath259 one therefore has that @xmath163 is equivalent to @xmath260 let now @xmath163 . the fourier transforms that follow are all of @xmath201-functions , therefore the corresponding integral expressions are meant as @xmath201-norm limits . from @xmath261 for a.e . @xmath262 , and from the distributional identity @xmath263 , one finds @xmath264 from this and from one deduces that the function @xmath265 vanishes in @xmath245 . plugging the last identity into yields @xmath266 which proves the first line in . this result , together with the anti - symmetry of @xmath243 , implies that @xmath267 we now observe that @xmath268 because @xmath269 , and that the map @xmath270 belongs to @xmath239 , because @xmath271 where we used @xmath272 thus , one can regard as the vanishing of a duality product between the spaces @xmath238 and @xmath239 , and since @xmath163 was arbitrary , one concludes the second line in . equations - are the fourier - transformed version of , and this concludes the proof of part ( i ) . concerning part ( ii ) , we first observe that the form domain of @xmath273 , namely the completion of @xmath274 , is the space @xmath275\;=\;h^1_0((\mathbb{r}^3\times\mathbb{r}^3)\!\setminus\!(\gamma_1\cup\gamma_2))\cap{\mathcal{h}}\,.\ ] ] by a standard approximation with smooth and compactly supported functions ( see appendix [ app : inclusions ] ) , @xmath276 and @xmath277 is the domain of the self - adjoint extension of @xmath273 given by the free negative laplacian on @xmath235 . therefore , owing to the characterisation of the friedrichs extension @xmath106 as the unique self - adjoint extension of @xmath8 whose operator domain is contained in @xmath107 $ ] , one deduces immediately .    in the next proposition we characterise the adjoint of @xmath8 , which is the preliminary step in order to identify the self - adjoint extensions of @xmath8 within the general scheme of the kren - viik - birman theory . proposition[prop : d_hdostar_2 + 1 ] let @xmath108 . * one has @xmath278 * there exist constants @xmath279 such that for a generic @xmath280 one has @xmath281 * the domain and the action of the adjoint of @xmath8 are given by @xmath282 and @xmath283 where @xmath284 and @xmath133 are defined as in above , and @xmath285    in order to prove part ( i ) we use the fact that @xmath286 if and only if for every @xmath287 @xmath288 where we applied in the last step . since @xmath289 ( owing to with @xmath290 ) and @xmath108 , then @xmath291 ( in the sense that each quantity controls the other from above and from below ) , and hence the fact that @xmath292 is equivalent to @xmath293 therefore , the last identity above implies , owing to the second line of , that @xmath294 for some @xmath295 , and hence each @xmath296 is of the form @xmath297 given by . part ( ii ) is taken directly from ( * ? ? ? * lemma b.2 ) . concerning part ( iii ) , because of @xmath160 and , we have that @xmath298 this , together with the decomposition formula of lemma [ lemma : krein_decomp_formula ] and the characterisation of @xmath139 yield immediately . the decomposition also implies that the action of @xmath138 on a generic element @xmath299 is the same as the action of @xmath300 on the component @xmath301 , while @xmath302 : this is precisely . as for , it is an immediate consequence of and . the space @xmath139 determined in is the kren space of the model ( the `` boundary value space '' , in modern terminology ) . it is known by the kren - viik - birman theory that the self - adjoint extensions of @xmath8 defined in are parametrised by self - adjoint operators acting on hilbert subspaces of @xmath139 , according to the classification given by theorem [ thm : vb - representaton - theorem_tversion ] in appendix [ app : kvb ] .    unlike the two - body model discussed in the previous section , where @xmath139 was one - dimensional , in the three - body model this space is _ infinite - dimensional _ ( compare with ) , which makes the variety of the self - adjoint extensions of @xmath8 much more complicated . in this respect , the extensions of ter - martirosyan  skornyakov type form a proper sub - family ( in the two - body case , all self - adjoint extensions were of tms type ) . eventually one introduces the tms extensions of @xmath8 , analogously to section [ subsec : tms-1 + 1 ] for the two - body model , as restrictions of @xmath11 to domains characterised by special asymptotics of their wave - functions in the vicinity of the coincidence hyperplanes . prior to that , in this subsection we shall develop a general scheme for the identification of a generic self - adjoint extension of @xmath8 , within which we will later select those of tms type . to this aim , it is convenient first to define the expressions @xmath303 and @xmath304 for fixed @xmath108 , where @xmath305 is given by and @xmath306    since , for arbitrary @xmath307 and @xmath308 , @xmath309 ( owing to a schwartz inequality in the first step and in the second one ) , we see that the integral in is finite for any @xmath308 , @xmath307 , while in general it diverges when @xmath310 , as the example @xmath311 shows . a similar argument shows that the integral in is finite too at least for @xmath310 . summarising , @xmath312 is well - defined point - wise for almost every @xmath313 for @xmath308 , @xmath307 , whereas @xmath314 is so ( at least ) for @xmath295 . the relevance of functions of the form @xmath315 and @xmath316 is due to the fact that they arise in the asymptotic behaviour of the elements of @xmath113 . lemma[lemma : asymptotic_integral_2 + 1 ] let @xmath114 be an arbitrary function in @xmath113 . for a fixed @xmath108 consider the decomposition of @xmath179 in terms of @xmath317 , @xmath318 , @xmath319 given by . then , as @xmath320 , @xmath321 as a point - wise identity for almost every @xmath322 . remark for a generic @xmath323 , and correspondingly for a generic charge @xmath310 , the quantity in the l.h.s . of is _ infinite _ for every finite @xmath20 because , as remarked after the definitions - , the quantity @xmath312 is in general infinite when @xmath310 . instead , when additionally @xmath308 , with @xmath307 , the r.h.s .  of is finite ( for almost every @xmath324 ) : this case corresponds to a dense set of @xmath114 s in @xmath113 , and for such @xmath114 s the quantity in the l.h.s . of is _ finite _ for finite @xmath20 and only diverges , linearly in @xmath20 , as @xmath320 . splitting @xmath325 according to yields @xmath326 the first summand in the r.h.s . of is a @xmath209-contribution , owing to lemma [ lemma : dom_hdot_ftransform_2 + 1](i ) . for the second summand , which is re - written as @xmath327 one finds @xmath328 whence @xmath329 analogously , for the third summand in the r.h.s . of one has @xmath330 and @xmath331 whence @xmath332 these findings , re - written with the definitions and , show that the r.h.s . of is precisely given by formula . thus , functions in @xmath113 display completely analogous asymptotics to the two - body model . it is important to observe , however , that whereas was an identity between _ scalars _ , here is a _ point - wise _ almost everywhere identity between _ functions_. this is a crucial difference to keep into account when one imposes the ter - martirosyan  skornyakov condition in such asymptotics .    to elaborate on this point further at a later stage , let us also interpret @xmath333 and @xmath334 as maps between suitable functional spaces . proposition[prop : t - w ] let @xmath108 . * for each @xmath335 the expression defines a densely defined and symmetric operator @xmath336 with domain @xmath337 . moreover , @xmath338 maps continuously @xmath339 into @xmath340 for each @xmath341 . instead , @xmath342 . * the expression defines a bounded , positive , and invertible linear operator @xmath343 , and for generic @xmath344 one has @xmath345    remark the choice of @xmath74 as the hilbert space where to study @xmath338 is made here for consistency with the previous literature @xcite , but it has no fundamental reason . as we shall discuss in subsection [ subsec : tms_2p1 ] below , what is intrinsically fundamental for the self - adjoint extension theory of @xmath8 is the operator @xmath346 on the hilbert space @xmath347 . \(i ) we re - write as @xmath348 , where @xmath349 the symmetry of @xmath338 on @xmath74 is obvious , since @xmath350 is the multiplication by a real function and @xmath351 is an integral operator with real and symmetric kernel , and so too is the fact that @xmath352 is dense in @xmath74 . it is also clear that @xmath353 , thus it only remains to prove that @xmath354 , i.e. , @xmath355 . in turn , setting @xmath356 , the last inequality is equivalent to @xmath357 , where @xmath358 it is easily verified ( using to introduce the @xmath359-factors ) that for the _ positive _ function @xmath360 one has @xmath361 and @xmath362 a standard schur test based on ( * ) and ( * * ) implies @xmath357 and hence @xmath354 for @xmath341 and arbitrary @xmath363 . the function @xmath364 is a counter - example showing that the same bound can not hold for @xmath365 : indeed , clearly @xmath366 for arbitrary @xmath367 , but @xmath368 and hence @xmath369 . \(ii ) for arbitrary @xmath370 we compute @xmath371 where we used the symmetry under exchange @xmath372 in the second step , in the third step , and in the last step . therefore , @xmath373 where we used in the last step , which shows that @xmath374 , that the map @xmath343 is bounded , and that holds true . owing to , one has @xmath375 , thus @xmath376 is positive . furthermore , the following chain of implications holds : @xmath377 @xmath378 @xmath379 @xmath380 @xmath378 @xmath381 @xmath378 @xmath382 , where we used in the first implication and in the last one ; this proves that @xmath376 is injective and hence invertible on its range . for a generic @xmath295 one has this chain of implications : @xmath383 @xmath384 @xmath378 @xmath379 @xmath385 @xmath378 @xmath386 @xmath378 @xmath387 ( again using in the first implication and in the last one ) , hence by duality @xmath388 must be dense in @xmath245 . since @xmath376 is bounded , then @xmath388 is also closed in @xmath245 , thus @xmath376 is an invertible bijection @xmath389 .    as an immediate consequence of proposition [ prop : t - w ] , @xmath390 defines a scalar product in @xmath391 . it is _ equivalent _ to the standard scalar product of @xmath391 , as follows by combining with . we shall denote by @xmath392 the hilbert space consisting of the @xmath391-functions and equipped with the scalar product @xmath393 . then the map @xmath394{\;\;\;\cong\;\;\;}\;h^{-1/2}_{w_\lambda}(\mathbb{r}^3)\,,\qquad u_\xi \longmapsto \,\xi \end{split}\ ] ] is an isomorphism between hilbert spaces , with @xmath139 equipped with the standard scalar product inherited from @xmath235 . one can therefore equivalently parametrise the self - adjoint extensions of @xmath8 in terms of self - adjoint operators acting on hilbert subspaces of @xmath139 or of @xmath392 . the whole family of such extensions is given by the kren - viik - birman theory through the classification of theorem [ thm : vb - representaton - theorem_tversion ] . the previous analysis brings us now to the class of operators on @xmath392 ( or , also , operators on @xmath139 ) which identify those self - adjoint extensions of @xmath8 of ter - martirosyan  skornyakov type .    as it will emerge in the following , the crucial point is the possibility of reducing @xmath338 to a @xmath201-closed invariant subspace with values into @xmath245 and to define on the orthogonal complement another @xmath396-valued symmetric operator @xmath397 . given the resulting @xmath398 one has then to investigate the self - adjointness of @xmath399 on @xmath392 . we observe that this is related to , but it is _ not _ the same question of the self - adjointness of @xmath338 on @xmath74 . the study of the self - adjoint extensions of @xmath338 , as a densely defined and symmetric operator on @xmath74 , has been carried on systematically in a series of works by minlos and shermatov @xcite , melnikov and minlos @xcite , shermatov @xcite , and minlos @xcite . in the additional work @xcite by one of us and co - workers , the friedrichs extension of @xmath338 was studied ( in those regime of masses @xmath228 in which @xmath338 itself is semi - bounded below ) . it is relevant to remark that in all those works @xmath352 was fixed in spaces of various regularity , at least @xmath400 . we recall from proposition [ prop : t - w](i ) that @xmath401 because both its multiplicative part @xmath350 and its integral part @xmath351 map separately @xmath400 into @xmath74 : as discussed in @xcite , in the domain of a self - adjoint extension @xmath402 of @xmath338 there are elements @xmath35 for which neither @xmath403 nor @xmath404 is square - integrable , but their difference is , due to a cancellation of singularities in @xmath405 . more precisely , @xmath338 commutes with the rotations in @xmath105 and , with respect to the canonical decomposition @xmath406 ( where the @xmath407 s are the spherical harmonics on @xmath408 ) , @xmath338 leaves each @xmath409 invariant and is densely defined and symmetric on @xmath409 , thus @xmath410 and @xmath411 therefore , the study of the self - adjointness or of the self - adjoint extensions of @xmath338 boils down to the same study for each @xmath412 . it is today well - known from the works cited above that for _ even _ @xmath413 s @xmath412 is self - adjoint on @xmath409 , while for _ odd _ @xmath413 s there exist masses @xmath414 such that @xmath412 is self - adjoint on @xmath409 for @xmath415 and it has instead a one - parameter family of self - adjoint extensions for @xmath416 $ ] . as seen in the proof of proposition [ prop : t - w](i ) , @xmath338 fails to map @xmath417 into @xmath245 and the counter - example considered therein was a function in @xmath418 . in fact , that failure is exceptional and it does not occur for @xmath419-functions with a sufficient amount of oscillations , as the following proposition shows . proposition[prop : t - ell ] for each @xmath420 , and in terms of the notation of - , @xmath421 whence , in particular , @xmath422    as discussed already in the proof of proposition [ prop : t - w](i ) , we only need to prove the statement for @xmath351 , the integral part of @xmath338  see . analogously to - , @xmath423 where @xmath424 acts symmetrically on @xmath425 . it is standard to derive from and that @xmath426 where @xmath427 is the @xmath413-th legendre polynomial . thus , proving is equivalent to proving @xmath428 which is in turn equivalent to the boundedness in @xmath429 of the integral operator @xmath430 defined by @xmath431 using and integrating by parts @xmath420 times in @xmath432 yields @xmath433 since @xmath434 , analogously to @xmath435 then @xmath436 where we used in the first and last step , and the formula @xmath437 ( @xmath438 ) in the third step . from @xmath439 we deduce @xmath440 and from @xmath441 we deduce @xmath442 a standard schur test based on ( * ) and ( * * ) implies @xmath443 , thus concluding the proof . an immediate consequence of propositions [ prop : t - w](i ) and [ prop : t - ell ] is the following . corollary let @xmath444 be the operator acting as @xmath338 on the hilbert space @xmath445 with domain @xmath446 . then @xmath444 is densely defined and symmetric , and it maps continuously @xmath447 ( with the @xmath448-norm ) into @xmath449 ( with the @xmath450-norm ) .    in turn , the corollary above , together with proposition , show that although in general @xmath451 nevertheless the map @xmath346 can be defined on parts of @xmath347 with values in itself . elaborating further , we obtain the following result . proposition[lem : selfadj_hierarchy ] the following be given :    * two constants @xmath108 and @xmath452 , * the densely defined and symmetric operator @xmath453 on the hilbert space @xmath445 which acts as @xmath338 with domain @xmath446 , * and a densely defined and symmetric operator @xmath397 on the hilbert space @xmath454 with @xmath455 .    with respect to the decomposition @xmath456 , let @xmath457 then @xmath458 is a densely defined and symmetric operator on @xmath74 and @xmath459 is a densely defined and symmetric operator on @xmath392 . moreover , if @xmath460 is a self - adjoint extension of @xmath461 on @xmath392 , then @xmath462 ( where @xmath463 is the isomorphism ) is a self - adjoint operator on @xmath139 . the statements for @xmath458 and @xmath464 are obvious , and so too is the density of @xmath465 in @xmath392 . the symmetry of @xmath461 follows from the identity , valid for @xmath466 , @xmath467 where we used the symmetry of @xmath458 in @xmath74 , the fact that @xmath62 is real , and the properties of @xmath376 discussed in proposition [ prop : t - w](ii ) . remark[rem : selfadj_of_t_not_enough ] if , in addition to the assumptions of proposition [ lem : selfadj_hierarchy ] above , one assumes also that @xmath444 and @xmath397 are self - adjoint on their respective hilbert spaces and hence @xmath458 is _ self - adjoint _ on @xmath74 , then @xmath468 to see this , we use the fact that for generic @xmath469 there exists @xmath470 such that @xmath471 owing to , , and , @xmath472 whereas , for @xmath473 , @xmath474 therefore , ( * ) reads @xmath475 or also ( using @xmath476 ) @xmath477 since @xmath458 is self - adjoint on @xmath74 , the last bound implies @xmath478 , whence the conclusion . we observe , however , that this argument and the conclusion are not enough to claim that the self - adjointness of @xmath458 implies the self - adjointness of @xmath461 : the latter could still have a larger adjoint and admit self - adjoint extensions . we thus see that each self - adjoint extension @xmath460 of @xmath461 on @xmath392 identifies one self - adjoint extension of @xmath8 by means of its unitarily equivalent version @xmath479 . this extension , call it @xmath212 , as prescribed by theorem [ thm : vb - representaton - theorem_tversion ] ( namely the kren - viik - birman extension theory ) is the restriction of @xmath11 to the domain @xmath480 indeed , in comparison with the general formula , @xmath481 has a trivial orthogonal complement in @xmath139 . for each @xmath223 one deduces from that @xmath482    a comparison between and shows that @xmath217 is obtained as a restriction @xmath113 by imposing the condition @xmath483 as an identity in @xmath139 which , by the unitary equivalence , is equivalent to @xmath484 as an identity in @xmath392 . the self - adjoint extension @xmath212 is given by the restriction of @xmath11 to those elements of @xmath113 whose charges , in terms of the decomposition , instead of belonging generically to @xmath347 are such that @xmath35 belongs to the domain of @xmath460 and @xmath485 is of the form @xmath486 . we now see that @xmath212 is an operator of tms type . indeed , owing to the definition , condition implies @xmath487 as an identity in @xmath74 . in turn , owing to the definition , reads @xmath488 plugging - into yields the following asymptotics for elements in @xmath217 as @xmath76 : @xmath489 @xmath490 the asymptotics is completely analogous to for the two - body system , except for the fact that it only holds for non - spherically symmetric charges . if the charge @xmath35 is spherically symmetric , then is modified with an additional @xmath215-term in @xmath20 as done in . in fact , both and express the same kind of ultra - violet asymptotics at the coincidence hyperplanes , for their formal inverse fourier transformed version reads @xmath491 where @xmath492 is identically zero if the charge @xmath35 associated to @xmath223 belongs to @xmath447 , whereas @xmath493 if @xmath494 . in either case the leading singularity in @xmath495 as @xmath496 is precisely of the form @xmath497 . we summarise the above analysis by saying that    * the operator @xmath212 , defined by - in terms of a self - adjoint extension @xmath460 of @xmath498 on @xmath392 , where @xmath499 , @xmath397 is a densely defined and symmetric operator @xmath397 on @xmath454 with @xmath455 , and @xmath500 is the component of @xmath338 on @xmath501 with domain @xmath502 , is a self - adjoint extension of @xmath8 because it satisfies the condition , which is a special case of the conditions of self - adjoint extension of the kren - viik - birman theory ; * and moreover @xmath212 is a hamiltonian of ter - martirosyan  skornyakov type because , through - , _ implies _ the tms asymptotics - . we observe , however , two fundamental differences with respect to the construction of the point interaction hamiltonian for the two - body system . in the two - body case , the tms condition , imposed in the asymptotics of the elements of @xmath113 , turns out to be a _ condition of self - adjoint extension_. in the 2 + 1 fermionic system , instead ,    * the tms condition is found to hold only for a class of self - adjoint extensions of @xmath8 , those identified a la kren - viik - birman by the _ constraint , * and if one imposes as a point - wise identity valid for a generic class of @xmath35 s , one is _ not _ guaranteed yet to have identified a domain of self - adjointness for an extension of @xmath8 , because in general such an ansatz is not implemented by a self - adjoint operator on @xmath183 . remark a clarification in retrospective on the emergence and the meaning of the operators @xmath397 and @xmath458 introduced in proposition [ lem : selfadj_hierarchy ] above is surely beneficial at this point . the key issue that arises evidently in our discussion is that defines a densely defined , symmetric operator @xmath338 on @xmath74 which fails to map a linear space of certain spherically symmetric @xmath448-functions into @xmath503 , whereas it does map into the latter space all the @xmath448-functions that are @xmath201-orthogonal to the spherically symmetric ones . as a consequence , unlike what is customarily given for granted at this point in the literature , there arises the issue to make the symmetric operator @xmath346 _ densely defined _ on the space of charges @xmath392 and to realise it self - adjointly . however , one would like to have a self - adjoint operator on @xmath392 precisely of the form @xmath346 : indeed on the one hand by general facts ( krein - vishik - birman ) a self - adjoint operator on @xmath392 identifies a self - adjoint hamiltonian of point interaction for the three - body system , and on the other hand the structure @xmath346 results in a ter - martirosyan  skornyakov condition for the elements in the domain of such an hamiltonian . the way to retrieve a tms - like hamiltonian was then to cure @xmath346 on the sector of spherical symmetry , by replacing @xmath338 with a modified operator @xmath504 , where @xmath444 is the restriction of @xmath338 to the subspace @xmath505 and @xmath397 is an arbitrary self - adjoint operator in @xmath454 _ with values in _ @xmath503 . the corresponding @xmath399 is now symmetric and densely defined on @xmath392 and any its self - adjoint extension identifies a tms hamiltonian for the three - body systems . for such a hamiltonian , the tms condition emerges only when the charge @xmath35 has symmetry @xmath420 ; on the sector @xmath506 what holds instead is the weaker condition . the latter still prescribes that the generic element @xmath495 of the domain of the tms hamiltonian has a leading singularity @xmath507 as @xmath508 when the charge @xmath35 associated to @xmath114 is spherically symmetric , however no @xmath62-constraint is prescribed between singular and regular part of @xmath114 . this larger freedom in the unconstrained regular part reflects precisely the arbitrariness of @xmath397 . for the two - body system with point interaction , imposing the tms asymptotics at scattering length @xmath509 selects the whole one - parameter family of self - adjoint extensions of @xmath8 , the formal free hamiltonian defined away from the coincidence configurations . for larger systems , @xmath8 has infinite deficiency indices and the tms asymptotics emerge for a proper subclass of extensions of @xmath8 , provided that the charges are taken in a domain of suitable regularity and symmetry . indeed , except for the two - body case , the tms condition expresses _ point - wise _ asymptotics , which per se is not enough to be a condition of self - adjointness : the latter has to be a suitable _ functional _ condition , such as in the preceding discussion . recognising a tms condition as a self - adjointness condition , by means of the general classification of self - adjoint extensions given by the kren - viik - birman theory , is an idea that dates back to the original announcements @xcite by minlos and faddeev in 1961 and it has been exploited in a series of works by minlos and collaborators @xcite .    to our understanding , however , the issue of making the operator that in our notation reads @xmath346 a well - defined map on the space of charges @xmath347 , more precisely the issue on whether @xmath510 , was never addressed , nor was it noted that @xmath338 fails to map spherically symmetric functions of @xmath417 into @xmath245 ( see proposition [ prop : t - w](i ) and its proof ) . in fact , in all recent works @xcite the initial domain of @xmath338 is taken to be @xmath400 and hence , owing to proposition [ prop : t - w](i ) , in general @xmath511 consists of @xmath201-functions that can not be pulled back to @xmath512-functions by the inverse of @xmath376 . also , the ubiquitous statement in the above - mentioned literature , according to which each self - adjoint realisation in @xmath74 of the operator @xmath338 defined formally by identifies ( by general facts of the kren - viik - birman theory ) a self - adjoint extension of @xmath8 that displays the tms asymptotics for the functions of its domain , need be made more precise in two crucial respects . first , one has to factor out the part of @xmath338 that acts on @xmath454 , the spherically symmetric functions , as we argued in proposition [ lem : selfadj_hierarchy ] and in the discussion that followed from it . second , even when @xmath338 is self - adjoint on the subspace of higher momentum charges , the corresponding densely defined and symmetric operator @xmath498 on @xmath392 is not necessarily self - adjoint and may in turn admit a multiplicity of self - adjoint extensions , as we observed in remark [ rem : selfadj_of_t_not_enough ] : only a self - adjoint extension @xmath460 of @xmath461 identifies , a la kren - viik - birman , the self - adjoint extension @xmath212 of @xmath8 . it remains therefore unclear how to relate the range of masses @xmath228 ( identified in @xcite ) in which @xmath338 , initially defined on @xmath513 , is self - adjoint or has a family of self - adjoint extensions on @xmath74 with the actual range of masses in which @xmath8 admits one or more self - adjoint extensions displaying the tms asymptotics . the fact that @xmath498 may be only symmetric on @xmath392 even when @xmath458 is self - adjoint on @xmath74 should account for a _ larger _ range of masses in which @xmath8 has a multiplicity of tms - like self - adjoint extensions than the range in which @xmath338 has a multiplicity of self - adjoint extensions . it becomes of great interest now to re - read and understand , in terms of the general classification of self - adjoint extensions of @xmath8 provided by the kren - viik - birman theory , those results that produced tms self - adjoint extensions of @xmath8 through an approach based on quadratic forms on hilbert space ( see @xcite and above all the recent work @xcite ) . indeed , the quadratic form approach produces a single self - adjoint tms hamiltonian , or alternatively a family of self - adjoint tms hamiltonians , all extensions of @xmath8 , in a regime of masses that differs from what is known from the operator - theoretic approach and that coincides instead to what is found in the physical literature  see ( * ? ? ? * remark 2.4 and proposition 2.2 ) , as well as the discussion around ( * ? ? ? * eq .  ( 1.17 ) ) . owing to the general picture of the self - adjoint extension theory , each such hamiltonian _ must _ be selected by a condition on the charges realised by a self - adjoint map on @xmath183 as in or , more generally , in . one should identify such a map and to compare it to its analog in the operator - theoretic approach . armed with the analysis and the discussion developed here , we plan to address these issues in a follow - up work . in this appendix we collect the main results of the kren - viik - birman theory of self - adjoint extensions of semi - bounded symmetric operators . this theory was developed by kren @xcite , viik @xcite , and birman @xcite ) between the mid 1940 s and the mid 1950 s . for the present formulation and the proof of all the statements that follow we refer to the comprehensive discussion @xcite , as well as to the expository works @xcite .    for any given symmetric operator @xmath514 with domain @xmath515 , let @xmath516 be the `` bottom '' of @xmath514 , i.e. , its greatest lower bound . hereafter @xmath514 shall be semi - bounded below , meaning therefore @xmath517 . it is not restrictive to assume henceforth @xmath518 for in the general case one applies the discussion that follows to the strictly positive operator @xmath519 , @xmath520 , and then re - express trivially the final results in terms of the original @xmath514 . when @xmath514 is densely defined , _ the choice @xmath521 implies that the friedrichs extension @xmath522 of @xmath514 is invertible with bounded inverse defined everywhere on @xmath235 _ : this will allow @xmath523 to enter directly the discussion . in the general case in which @xmath522 is not necessarily invertible , the role of @xmath523 is naturally replaced by the inverse @xmath524 of any a priori known self - adjoint extension @xmath525 of @xmath514 , which thus takes the role of given `` datum '' of the theory . moreover , with the choice @xmath521 , the level @xmath526 becomes naturally the reference value with respect to which to express the other distinguished ( canonically given ) extension of @xmath514 , the kren - von neumann extension @xmath527 . lemma[lemma : krein_decomp_formula ] _ ( decomposition formulas ) _ for a densely defined symmetric operator @xmath514 with positive bottom , one has @xmath528 theorem[thm : vb - representaton - theorem_tversion ] _ ( classification of self - adjoint extensions  operator version . ) _ let @xmath514 be a densely defined symmetric operator on a hilbert space @xmath235 with positive bottom ( @xmath521 ) . there is a one - to - one correspondence between the family of all self - adjoint extensions of @xmath514 on @xmath235 and the family of the self - adjoint operators on hilbert subspaces of @xmath529 . if @xmath530 is any such operator , in the correspondence @xmath531 each self - adjoint extension @xmath532 of @xmath514 is given by @xmath533    theorem[thm : semibdd_exts_operator_formulation_tversion]_(characterisation of semi - bounded extensions . ) _ let @xmath514 be a densely defined symmetric operator on a hilbert space @xmath235 with positive bottom . if , with respect to the notation of , @xmath532 is a self - adjoint extension of @xmath514 , and if @xmath534 , then @xmath535 as an immediate consequence , @xmath536 for any semi - bounded @xmath532 . in particular , positivity or strict positivity of the bottom of @xmath532 is equivalent to the same property for @xmath530 , that is , @xmath537 moreover , if @xmath538 , then @xmath539    theorem[thm : semibdd_exts_form_formulation_tversion]_(characterisation of semi - bounded extensions  form version . ) _ let @xmath514 be a densely defined symmetric operator on a hilbert space @xmath235 with positive bottom and , with respect to the notation of , let @xmath532 be a _ semi - bounded _ ( not necessarily positive ) self - adjoint extension of @xmath514 . then @xmath540_tversion } \mathcal{d}[t]\;=\ ;

"in the minimal standard model of electroweak interactions , the lepton number conservation is assumed and neutrinos are exactly massless weyl particles . however , today s super - kamiokande @xcite , sno @xcite , kamland @xcite and k2k @xcite neutrino oscillation experiments have provided us with very strong evidence that neutrinos are actually massive and lepton flavor mixing does exist . the most economical modification of the minimal standard model , which can both accommodate neutrino masses and allow lepton number violation to explain the cosmological baryon asymmetry via leptogenesis @xcite , is to introduce two heavy right - handed neutrinos @xmath2 and keep the lagrangian of electroweak interactions invariant under the @xmath3 gauge transformation @xcite . after the spontaneous electroweak symmetry breaking , this simple but interesting model yields the following neutrino mass term : @xmath4 where @xmath5 with @xmath6 being the charge - conjugation operator ; and @xmath7 denote the left - handed neutrinos . the dirac neutrino mass matrix @xmath8 is a @xmath9 rectangular matrix , and the majorana neutrino mass matrix @xmath10 is a @xmath11 symmetric matrix . the scale of @xmath8 is characterized by the electroweak scale @xmath12 gev . in contrast , the scale of @xmath10 can be much higher than @xmath13 , because @xmath14 and @xmath15 are @xmath16 singlets and their corresponding mass term is not subject to the scale of gauge symmetry breaking . then one may obtain the effective ( light and left - handed ) neutrino mass matrix @xmath17 via the well - known seesaw mechanism @xcite : @xmath18 without loss of generality , both @xmath10 and the charged lepton mass matrix @xmath19 can be taken to be diagonal , real and positive ; i.e. , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , where @xmath22 denote the masses of two heavy majorana neutrinos . in such a specific flavor basis , the low - energy neutrino phenomenology is governed by @xmath17 , while the cosmological baryon number asymmetry is associated with @xmath8 via the leptogenesis mechanism . unfortunately , the model itself has no restriction on the structure of @xmath8 . in ref . @xcite , frampton , glashow and yanagida ( fgy ) have conjectured that @xmath8 may take the form @xmath23 or @xmath24 the texture zeros in @xmath8 could stem from an underlying horizontal flavor symmetry . with the help of eq .

( 3 ) or ( 4 ) . in other words , the minimal seesaw model itself guarantees that @xmath27 holds automatically . ] note also that @xmath28 holds in the chosen flavor basis , where @xmath29 ( for @xmath30 ) denote the masses of three light neutrinos . thus one of three neutrino masses must vanish . as the solar neutrino oscillation data have set @xmath31 @xcite , we are left with either @xmath32 ( normal hierarchy ) or @xmath33 ( inverted hierarchy ) . in ref . @xcite , the majorana neutrino mass matrix with one texture zero and one vanishing eigenvalue has been classified and discussed in some detail .    the main purpose of this paper is to reveal a very striking feature of the minimal seesaw model in which the fgy ansatz is incorporated : all nontrivial cp - violating phases can be calculated in terms of the lepton flavor mixing angles @xmath34 and the ratio of @xmath0 to @xmath1 , where @xmath0 and @xmath1 stand respectively for the typical mass - sqaured differences of solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillations . this important point , which was not observed in the previous analyses of the minimal seesaw model @xcite , implies that a stringent test of the fgy ansatz can simply be realized once the smallest mixing angle @xmath35 is measured or constrained to a better degree of accuracy . considering both normal and inverted mass hierarchies of three light neutrinos , we obtain very specific predictions for the cosmological baryon number asymmetry , the effective mass of neutrinoless double beta decay and cp violation in neutrino oscillations . without loss of generality , one may always redefine the phases of charged lepton fields to make @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 of @xmath8 real and positive @xcite . in other words , only @xmath39 is complex and its phase @xmath40 is the sole source of cp violation in the model under discussion . because both @xmath19 and @xmath10 have been taken to be diagonal , real and positive , @xmath17 can in general be parametrized as follows : @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are two phase matrices , and @xmath44 is given by @xmath45 with @xmath46 , @xmath47 and so on . the phase parameter of @xmath44 ( dirac phase ) governs the strength of cp violation in neutrino oscillations , while two independent phase parameters of @xmath48 ( majorana phases ) are relevant to the neutrinoless double beta decay @xcite . the phases of @xmath49 can not be neglected in the parametrization of @xmath17  their essential role is to fulfil a complete match between the phases of @xmath17 in eq . ( 5 ) or ( 6 ) and those defined in eqs . ( 7 ) and ( 8) . it is then obvious that the nontrivial phases of @xmath49 , @xmath44 and @xmath48 should have definite relations with @xmath50 . note that three mixing angles of @xmath44 can directly be given in terms of the mixing angles of solar , atmospheric and reactor @xcite neutrino oscillations . namely , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 hold as a good approximation . in view of current experimental data , we have @xmath54 and @xmath55 ( best - fit values @xcite ) as well as @xmath56 . the mass - squared differences of solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillations are defined respectively as @xmath57 and @xmath58 . their best - fit values read @xmath59 and @xmath60 @xcite . these typical numbers will be used in our numerical calculations .    to be more specific , we shall concentrate on the fgy ansatz for @xmath8 in eq . ( 3 ) or equivalently @xmath17 in eq . ( 5 ) . some brief comments will be given on the consequences of @xmath8 in eq . ( 4 ) or equivalently @xmath17 in eq . ( 6 ) . indeed , both possibilities lead to very similar phenomenological results . if @xmath61 holds , we obtain @xmath62 ev and @xmath63 ev . in this case , only a single majorana phase of cp violation is physically nontrivial . hence the phase matrix @xmath48 can be simplied to @xmath64 and six independent matrix elements of @xmath17 can be written as @xmath65 \ ; , \nonumber   \\ ( m_\nu)_{22 } & = & e^{2i\beta } \left [ m_2 \left ( -s_x s_y s_z + c_x c_y e^{-i\delta } \right ) ^2 e^{2i\sigma } + m_3 s^2_y c^2_z \right ] \ ; , \nonumber \\ ( m_\nu)_{33 } & = & e^{2i\gamma } \left [ m_2 \left ( s_x c_y s_z + c_x s_y e^{-i\delta } \right ) ^2 e^{2i\sigma } + m_3 c^2_y c^2_z \right ] \ ; ; %        ( 9)\end{aligned}\ ] ] and @xmath66 \ ; , \nonumber   \\ ( m_\nu)_{13 } & = & e^{i(\alpha+\gamma ) } \left [ -m_2 s_x c_z \left ( s_x c_y s_z + c_x s_y e^{-i\delta } \right ) e^{2i\sigma } + m_3 c_y s_z c_z \right ] \ ; , \nonumber \\ ( m_\nu)_{23 } & = & e^{i(\beta+\gamma ) } \left [ -m_2 \left ( s_x c_y s_z + c_x s_y e^{-i\delta } \right ) \left ( -s_x s_y s_z + c_x c_y e^{-i\delta } \right ) e^{2i\sigma } + m_3 s_y c_y c^2_z \right ] \ ; . %        ( 10)\end{aligned}\ ] ] because of @xmath67 as shown in eq . ( 5 ) , we straightforwardly obtain @xmath68 \ ; , \nonumber \\ \sigma & = & \frac{1}{2 } \arctan \left [ \frac{c_x s_y \sin\delta } { s_x c_y s_z + c_x s_y \cos\delta } \right ] \ ; , %        ( 11)\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath69 . this result implies that both @xmath70 and @xmath71 can definitely be determined , if and only if the smallest mixing angle @xmath35 is measured .    to establish the relationship between @xmath50 and @xmath70 , we need to figure out @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 . because @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are real and positive , @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 must be real and positive . then @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 can be derived from eqs . ( 10 ) and ( 11 ) : @xmath78 \ ; , \nonumber \\ \beta & = & -\gamma - \arctan \left [ \frac{c_x c_y s_z \sin\delta } { s_x s_y - c_x c_y s_z \cos\delta } \right ] \ ; , \nonumber \\ \gamma & = & + \frac{1}{2 } \arctan \left [ \frac{s^2_z \sin 2\sigma}{\xi s^2_x c^2_z + s^2_z \cos 2\sigma } \right ] \ ; . %        ( 12)\end{aligned}\ ] ] then the overall phase of @xmath79 , which is equal to the phase of @xmath39 , is given by @xmath80 \ ; . %        ( 13)\ ] ] now that all six phase parameters ( @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath50 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 ) have been determined in terms of @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath35 , a measurement of the unknown angle @xmath35 becomes crucial to test the model . the phase parameters @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 can be fixed by taking account of the positiveness of @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 . with the help of eqs . ( 14 ) and ( 15 ) , we obtain @xmath91 \ ; , \nonumber \\ \beta & = & \gamma + \pi \ ; , \nonumber \\ \gamma & = & \frac{\delta}{2 } + \frac{1}{2 } \arctan \left [ \frac{s_x s_y \sin \delta}{s_x s_y \cos \delta - c_x c_y s_z } \right ] - \pi \ ; . %        ( 17)\end{aligned}\ ] ] then the overall phase of @xmath79 , which is equal to the phase of @xmath39 , is given by @xmath92 - \pi \ ; . %        ( 18)\ ] ] again , a measurement of the unknown mixing angle @xmath35 will allow us to determine all six phase parameters ( @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath50 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 ) .      using the best - fit values of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 , we illustrate the numerical dependence of six phase parameters @xmath94 on the smallest mixing angle @xmath35 in fig . 1(a ) and fig . 1(b ) for the @xmath61 case and in fig . 2(a ) and fig . 2(b ) for the @xmath33 case . some discussions are in order . \(1 ) in the @xmath32 case , @xmath35 is restricted to a very narrow range @xmath95 ( namely , @xmath96 ) . this result implies that the fgy ansatz with @xmath32 is highly sensitive to @xmath35 and can easily be ruled out if the experimental value of @xmath35 does not really lie in the predicted region . to a good degree of accuracy , we obtain @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 . these instructive relations can essentially be observed from eqs . ( 11 ) , ( 12 ) and ( 13 ) , because of @xmath101 . note that we have only shown the dependence of @xmath70 on @xmath35 in the range @xmath102 . the reason is simply that only this range can lead to @xmath103 ( i.e. , the positive cosmological baryon number asymmetry ) , as one can see later on . \(2 ) in the @xmath104 case , there is no strong constraint on @xmath35 except that @xmath105 ( or equivalently @xmath106 ) must hold . we see that @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 hold to a good degree of accuracy . these results can also be observed from eqs . ( 16 ) , ( 17 ) and ( 18 ) by taking account of @xmath101 . again , we have used the positive sign of @xmath111 to constrain the allowed range of @xmath70 . the other phase parameters are required to take possible values between @xmath112 and @xmath113 .    as useful by - products , the jarlskog parameter of cp violation ( @xmath114 @xcite ) and the effective mass of neutrinoless double beta decay ( @xmath115 @xcite ) can be calculated . we show the numerical results of @xmath114 versus @xmath115 in fig . 1(c ) for @xmath32 and in fig . 2(c ) for @xmath33 , respectively . it is clear that @xmath116 and @xmath117 mev in the @xmath32 case , while @xmath118 and @xmath119 ev in the @xmath104 case . the present experimental upper bound of @xmath120 is @xmath121 ev at the @xmath122 confidence level @xcite . because of lepton number violation , two heavy majorana neutrinos @xmath123 ( for @xmath124 and 2 ) may decay into @xmath125 and its cp - conjugate state , where @xmath126 denotes the left - handed lepton doublet and @xmath127 stands for the higgs - boson weak isodoublet . the decay occurs at both the tree level and the one - loop level ( via self - energy and vertex corrections ) , and their interference leads to a cp - violating asymmetry @xmath128 between the @xmath129-conjugated @xmath130 and @xmath131 processes @xcite . if the masses of @xmath14 and @xmath15 are hierarchical ( i.e. , @xmath132 ) , the interactions of @xmath14 can be in thermal equilibrium when @xmath15 decays . the asymmetry @xmath133 is therefore erased before @xmath14 decays , and only the asymmetry @xmath134 produced by the out - of - equilibrium decay of @xmath14 survives . in the flavor basis chosen above , we have @xmath135 ^ 2 } { ( m^\dagger_{\rm d } m_{\rm d})_{11 } } \nonumber \\ & = & \frac{3}{16\pi v^2 } \cdot \frac{\displaystyle m_1 |(m_\nu)_{12}|^2 |(m_\nu)_{23}|^2 \sin 2\phi } { \displaystyle \left [ |(m_\nu)_{11}|^2 + |(m_\nu)_{12}|^2 \right ]      it is clear that @xmath134 and @xmath111 only involve two free parameters : @xmath155 and @xmath50 . because @xmath50 is associated with the unknown flavor mixing angle @xmath35 , one may analyze the dependence of @xmath111 on @xmath35 for given values of @xmath155 . for @xmath32 and @xmath104 cases , we plot the numerical results of @xmath111 in fig . 1(d ) and fig . 2(d ) respectively . some comments are in order . \(1 ) in the @xmath32 case , current observational data of @xmath111 require @xmath156 gev for the allowed ranges of @xmath157 . once @xmath157 is precisely measured , it is possible to fix the value of @xmath155 in most cases ( e.g. , @xmath158 gev will be ruled out , if @xmath159 holds ) . \(2 ) in the @xmath33 case , @xmath160 gev is required by current observational data of @xmath111 . although @xmath35 is less restricted in this scenario , it remains possible to determine the value of @xmath155 once @xmath35 is measured ( e.g. , @xmath161 gev is expected , if @xmath162 holds ) . \(3 ) one can carry out a similar analysis of @xmath111 in the framework of supersymmetric seesaw and leptogenesis models . however , the fgy ansatz does not favor @xmath163 gev , which crucially affects the maximum reheating temperature of the universe after inflation in the generic supergravity models @xcite . we remark that the cosmological baryon number asymmetry is closely correlated with the jarlskog parameter of cp violation in the fgy ansatz . for illustration , we plot the numerical correlation between @xmath111 and @xmath114 in fig . 3 , where @xmath164 gev for the @xmath61 case and @xmath165 gev for the @xmath33 case have typically been taken . one can see that the observationally - allowed range of @xmath111 corresponds to @xmath166 in the @xmath61 case and @xmath167 in the @xmath33 case . the correlation between @xmath111 and @xmath114 is so strong that a measurement of the latter in the long - baseline neutrino oscillation experiments could shed some light on the ball - park magnitude of @xmath155 . it is worth mentioning that we have neglected possible renormalization - group running effects of neutrino masses and lepton flavor mixing parameters between the scales of @xmath13 and @xmath155 @xcite . such an approximation is expected to be safe in the @xmath32 case , in which three light neutrinos have a clear mass hierarchy . in the @xmath104 case , in which @xmath168 holds , a careful analysis of possible running effects on the fgy ansatz is needed @xcite but it is beyond the scope of this paper . finally let us comment on possible phenomenological consequences of the fgy ansatz for @xmath8 in eq . ( 4 ) or equivalently @xmath17 in eq . ( 6 ) . in the @xmath61 case , one can make use of eqs . ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) to calculate relevant phase parameters by setting @xmath169 . a similar analysis can be done for the @xmath33 case by using eqs . ( 14 ) and ( 15 ) and taking @xmath169 . we find that the simple replacements @xmath170 and @xmath171 may allow us to write out the expressions of @xmath71 , @xmath50 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 in the @xmath169 case directly from eqs . ( 11)(13 ) and ( 16)(18 ) . it turns out that the numerical results of @xmath71 , @xmath50 and @xmath72 are essentially unchanged , but those of @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath114 require the replacements @xmath172 and @xmath173 . the results for @xmath111 are essentially identical in @xmath169 and @xmath174 cases . we have analyzed the minimal seesaw model for leptogenesis and neutrino mixing , in which the fgy ansatz is incorporated . we point out a very striking feature of this model : all nontrivial cp - violating phases can be determined in terms of the lepton flavor mixing angles and the ratio of @xmath0 to @xmath1 . this important observation allows us to make very specific and testable predictions for the cosmological baryon number asymmetry , the effective mass of neutrinoless double beta decay and cp violation in neutrino oscillations . a precise measurement of the smallest mixing angle in reactor- and accelerator - based neutrino oscillation experiments will be extremely helpful to examine the fgy ansatz and other presently viable ans@xmath175tze of lepton mass matrices . t. yanagida , in _ proceedings of the workshop on unified theory and the baryon number of the universe _ , edited by o. sawada and a. sugamoto ( kek , 1979 ) ; m. gell - mann , p. ramond , and r. slansky , in _ supergravity _ , edited by f. van nieuwenhuizen and d. freedman ( north holland , amsterdam , 1979 ) .                    for recent reviews of leptogenesis with extensive references , see : w. buchm@xmath177ller and m. pl@xmath177macher , int a * 15 * , 5047 ( 2000 ) ; g.f . giudice , a. notari , m. raidal , a. riotto , and a. strumia , hep - ph/0310123 . e.w . kolb and m.s . turner , _ the early universe _ , addison - wesley ( 1990 ) ; h.b . nielsen and y. takanishi , phys . b * 507 * , 241 ( 2001 ) ; e.kh . akhmedov , m. frigerio , and a.yu . smirnov , jhep * 0309 * , 021 ( 2003 ) .","The text discusses the minimal seesaw model of neutrino mass and lepton number conservation, which is a theoretical framework that attempts to explain the observed properties of neutrinos.

"the @xmath6 interaction near threshold is strongly attractive , in agreement with the existence of the unstable bound state @xmath7 below the @xmath8 threshold . the @xmath0-nucleus interaction is also strongly attractive , as derived from the strong - interaction shifts and widths in kaonic - atom levels across the periodic table @xcite . it is not established yet how strong the @xmath0-nucleus potential is : ` deep ' ( 150 - 200 mev @xcite ) or relatively ` shallow ' ( 50 - 60 mev @xcite ) ? is it possible to bind _ strongly _ @xmath0 mesons in nuclei and are such potentially deep bound states sufficiently narrow to allow observation and identification ? these issues have received considerable phenomenological and theoretical attention recently @xcite , and some experimental evidence for candidate states in the @xmath9 and @xmath10 reactions on @xmath11he ( kek - ps e471 , @xcite respectively ) and in the @xmath12 in - flight reaction on @xmath4o ( bnl - ags , parasite e930 @xcite ) has been presented very recently . new experiments have been approved at kek , using @xmath13 reactions to search for @xmath0 nuclear bound states @xcite . @xmath14 reactions @xcite were also suggested in this context . a prime concern in searching for @xmath0 nuclear bound states is the anticipated large width due to pionic conversion modes on a single nucleon : @xmath15 with thresholds about 100 mev and 180 mev , respectively , below the @xmath16 total mass , and also due to non - pionic multi - nucleon absorption modes , say @xmath17 with thresholds about @xmath18 mev lower than the single - nucleon thresholds . the branching ratios in parentheses are known from bubble - chamber experiments @xcite . the aim of the present work is to study _ dynamical _ effects for @xmath0 nuclear states in the range of binding energy @xmath19 mev @xcite and in particular the width anticipated for such deeply bound states . the relatively shallow chirally - motivated @xmath0-nucleus potentials @xcite which followed the microscopic construction by ramos and oset @xcite are of no use in this context , since they can not yield binding energy greater than the potential depth of about 50 mev . one must therefore depart from the microscopic approach in favor of a more phenomenologically inclined model which is constrained by data other than two - body @xmath6 observables . the theoretical framework here adopted is the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) model for a system of nucleons and one @xmath0 meson interacting through the exchange of scalar ( @xmath20 ) and vector ( @xmath21 ) boson fields which are treated in the mean - field approximation . by allowing the @xmath0 to polarize the nucleons , and vice versa , this dynamical calculation is made self consistent . @xmath0 absorption modes are included within a @xmath22 optical - model approach , where the density @xmath23 plays a dynamical role , and the constant @xmath24 which is constrained near threshold by @xmath2-atom data follows the phase - space reduction in reactions eqs . ( [ eq : conv1],[eq : conv2 ] ) for a deeply bound @xmath0 . a wide range of binding energies may be explored in the rmf calculation simply by scanning over the coupling constants of the @xmath0 meson to the @xmath20 and @xmath21 boson fields . detailed calculations were done by us across the periodic table . in this letter we demonstrate the essential points and conclusions for @xmath3c and @xmath4o where the dynamical polarization effects are extremely important for the energies of the @xmath0 bound states as well as for their widths . akaishi et al . @xcite too have found large polarization effects in lighter nuclei using few - body variational techniques . the rmf is a systematic approach used across the periodic table beyond the very light elements explored by other techniques , and it can be used also to study multi-@xmath0 configurations and to explore the @xmath0 condensation limit @xcite . similar rmf calculations have been recently reported for @xmath25 states in nuclei @xcite . in the calculations described below , the standard rmf lagrangian @xmath26 with the linear ( l ) parameterization of horowitz and serot @xcite as well as the nonlinear ( nl ) parameterization due to sharma et al . @xcite are used for the description of the nucleonic sector . the ( anti)kaon interaction with the nuclear medium is incorporated by adding to @xmath26 the lagrangian density @xmath27 @xcite : @xmath28 the covariant derivative @xmath29 describes the coupling of the ( anti)kaon to the vector meson @xmath21 . the vector field @xmath21 is then associated with a conserved current . the coupling of the ( anti)kaon to the isovector @xmath23 meson is here excluded due to considering @xmath30 nuclear cores in this initial report .    whereas adding @xmath31 to the original lagrangian @xmath26 does not affect the form of the corresponding dirac equation for nucleons , the presence of @xmath0 leads to additional source terms in the equations of motion for the meson fields @xmath20 and @xmath32 to which the @xmath0 couples : @xmath33 @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the @xmath0 energy in the nuclear medium : @xmath36 and @xmath37 and @xmath38 denote the nuclear scalar and vector densities , respectively . adding @xmath0 to the nuclear system affects the scalar and vector potentials which enter the dirac equation for nucleons . this leads to the rearrangement , or polarization of the nuclear core in the presence of @xmath0 .    in order to preserve the connection to previous studies of kaonic atoms , the klein gordon ( kg ) equation of motion for the @xmath0 is written in the form @xcite : @xmath39{\bar k } = 0~~ ~~ ( \hbar = c = 1).\ ] ] here , @xmath40 denotes the static coulomb potential for the @xmath2 , @xmath41 is the @xmath0-nucleus reduced mass and @xmath42 is the complex binding energy . the real part of the @xmath0 optical potential @xmath43 is then given by @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the scalar and vector potentials due to the @xmath20 and @xmath21 mean fields , respectively . since the rmf approach does not address the imaginary part of the potential , @xmath47 was taken in a phenomenological @xmath22 form , where its depth was fitted to the @xmath2 atomic data @xcite . note that @xmath23 in the present calculations is no longer a static nuclear density , but is a _ dynamical _ entity affected by the @xmath0 interacting with the nucleons via boson fields . the resulting compressed nuclear density leads to increased widths , particularly for deeply bound states . on the other hand , the phase space available for the decay products is reduced for deeply bound states , which will act to decrease the calculated widths . thus , suppression factors multiplying @xmath47 were introduced from phase - space considerations , taking into account the binding energy of the kaon for the initial decaying state , and assuming two - body final - state kinematics for the decay products . two absorption channels were considered . in the first , eq .

( [ eq : sigma],[eq : omega ] ) above , as well as the kg equation ( [ eq : kg1 ] ) for @xmath2 were solved self - consistently using an iterative procedure . obviously , the requirement of self - consistency is crucial for the proper evaluation of the dynamical effects of the @xmath0 on the nuclear core and vice versa . we note that self - consistency is not imposed here on the final - state hadrons which only enter through their _ on - shell _ masses used in the phase - space suppression factors given above . for the main @xmath72 decay channel it is likely that the attraction provided by the pion within a dynamical calculation @xcite is largely cancelled by the nuclear repulsion deduced phenomenologically for @xmath62 hyperons @xcite . the main objective of the present calculations of @xmath0-nucleus bound states was to establish correlations between various observables such as the @xmath0 binding energy , width and macroscopic nuclear properties . in particular we aimed at covering a wide range of binding energies in order to evaluate widths of possible strongly bound @xmath0 states . furthermore , in order to study effects of the nuclear polarization , we calculated rms radii and average densities of the nuclei involved and , in some cases , also single particle energies . extensive calculations were made for @xmath3c and @xmath4o , nuclei that had been discussed earlier in the context of strongly bound @xmath0 states @xcite . additionally , more restricted calculations were made for @xmath73ca and @xmath74pb .    in a preliminary test we performed dynamical calculations for @xmath2 _ atomic _ @xmath75 states , which produced only negligibly small polarization effects , thus validating previous analyses of kaonic atom data . the empirical values @xmath76 and @xmath77 , as found from a fit to kaonic atom data @xcite , were therefore used as a starting point for calculations . a full dynamical calculation was then made for @xmath2 _ nuclear _ states starting from the @xmath22 imaginary potential obtained from the atomic fit , while entering dynamically in the iteration cycles the resulting nuclear density and the suppression factor @xmath78 as defined by eq.([eq : spf ] ) . dynamical _ calculation nearly doubled , for the light nuclei here considered , the depth of the real part of the phenomenological _ static _ @xmath2-nucleus potential of ref . @xcite which is of the ` deep ' variety , typically 150 - 200 mev deep in the static calculation .    since there is no preferred way of varying the depth of the real @xmath2-nucleus potential in order to produce different values of binding energies , we used two methods for scanning over binding energies . the first one , referred to below as the ` rmf ' method , was to scale down successively @xmath79 from its initial value @xmath76 and , once it reached zero , to scale down @xmath80 too from its initial value @xmath77 until the @xmath2 @xmath75 state became unbound . as an alternative method we chose as a starting point values @xmath81 and @xmath82 obtained from fits to kaonic atom data where the rmf - based real potential was joined at large radii by a @xmath83 expression , using for @xmath24 the chiral @xmath1 amplitudes of ramos and oset @xcite . this starting potential was of the ` shallow ' variety @xcite , about 55 mev deep in the static calculation . it is gratifying that the replacement of the chiral @xmath83 expression within the nucleus by the rmf model did not change the resulting @xmath0-nuclear potential depth . we then increased the potential depth by scaling up @xmath79 from its initial value @xmath81 , in order to achieve as deep binding as in the first set of calculations , while keeping @xmath80 constant at its initial value @xmath82 . this second method will be referred to below as the ` chiral tail ' method . note that in both methods ( @xmath84 ) the starting values ( @xmath85 ) correspond to potentials that produce in the dynamical calculation good fits to the @xmath2 atomic data , although re @xmath86 have vastly different depths . the good fits to the atomic data are inevitably lost once the coupling constants ( @xmath79 in the procedure outlined above ) are allowed to vary in order to scan over a wide range of binding energies and the associated widths . figure [ fig : gamma ] shows , in its middle and lower parts , calculated widths @xmath87 as function of the binding energy @xmath88 for @xmath75 states in @xmath89o and @xmath90c , respectively . open squares and solid circles are for the l and nl versions of the rmf model , respectively , both calculated using the ` rmf ' method for scanning the binding energies . the crosses are for rmf - l , using the ` chiral tail ' method for scanning the binding energies . it is clearly seen that the widths of the @xmath2 nuclear state follow closely the dependence of the suppression factor on the binding energy and that , except for binding energies smaller than 50 mev , the dependence of the width on the binding energy follows , for a given nucleus , almost a universal curve . we note that the widths calculated in the range @xmath91 mev assume values @xmath92 mev , which are considerably larger than what the suppression factor of the upper part of the figure would suggest . this is largely related to the dynamical nature of the rmf calculation whereby the nuclear density is increased by the polarization effect of the @xmath2 , as shown in the next figures . furthermore , replacing @xmath23 by @xmath61 for the density dependence of the non - pionic decay modes ( [ eq : conv2 ] ) is estimated to increase the above values of the width by 10 - 15 mev . this estimate follows , again , from the increase of nuclear density with @xmath68 noticed above . switching on the @xmath93 decay mode would increase further this estimate by 5 - 10 mev in the range @xmath94 mev . we assert that the estimate @xmath95 mev in the range @xmath91 mev provides a reasonable lower bound on the width expected in any realistic calculation . a more detailed systematics is defered to a subsequent regular report . figures [ fig : nuclc ] and [ fig : nuclo ] exhibit various nuclear properties for @xmath75 states in @xmath90c and @xmath89o , respectively . the top and middle parts show the calculated average nuclear density @xmath96 and the nuclear rms radius , respectively , and the lower parts show the @xmath75 and @xmath97 neutron single - particle energies @xmath98 . the differences between the linear and non - linear models reflect the different nuclear compressibility and the somewhat different nuclear sizes obtained in the two models . again , for @xmath2 binding energy greater than 50 mev the results are independent of the way the binding energy is being scanned . it is interesting to note that the increase in the nuclear rms radius of @xmath89o for large values of @xmath88 is the result of the reduced binding energy of the @xmath99 state , due to the increased spin - orbit term . note also that as @xmath88 approaches zero we do _ not _ recover the values inherent in static calculations for the various nuclear entities because the coupling constants @xmath79 and @xmath80 , and the imaginary part of the potential , still assume nonzero values . the substantial increase of @xmath100 , the decrease of the nuclear rms radius , and the decrease of the @xmath75 neutron single - particle energy , all point out to a significant polarization of the nuclear core by the @xmath75 @xmath2 . finally , we note that in similar calculations for @xmath73ca and @xmath74pb the widths of the @xmath2 nuclear state _ vs. _ its binding energy turned out to be similar in shape to the corresponding results for @xmath3c and @xmath4o , but the effects on the average density and the rms radius are negligibly small , as expected for heavier nuclei . table [ tab : tabl1 ] shows several examples of the excited - state spectrum of @xmath2-nuclear states in the core of @xmath4o . the calculated widths of the excited states appear to follow the general trend of widths for @xmath75 states as shown in fig . [ fig : gamma ] . the polarization of the nucleus as judged by the value of its average density @xmath101 appears to diminish , the higher the @xmath2 state is , in agreement with fig . [ fig : nuclo ] . we note the fairly large spacing between neighboring states : the effective @xmath102 is of order 100 mev for the first spectrum , decreasing to 80 mev and to 70 mev in the second and third spectra , respectively , as the @xmath75 binding is made lower . static calculations give smaller spacings . kishimoto et al . @xcite have very recently suggested evidence from the measured neutron spectrum in the @xmath103 reaction for a peak at @xmath104 mev which they interpreted as the @xmath97 @xmath0 state , probably since a hint for a peak at @xmath105 mev is also suggested by the same spectrum . the results shown in table [ tab : tabl1 ] rule out such interpretation which would require @xmath106 mev , considerably less than our _ dynamical _ calculations produce . if the peak at @xmath104 mev were a @xmath97 state , one should have expected the @xmath75 state to be deeply bound , at @xmath107 mev where no signal has been observed . on the other hand , if this peak is a @xmath75 state , then the relatively shallow @xmath97 state would be expected too broad to be distinguished in the data . binding energies and widths of deeply bound @xmath2 nuclear states in @xmath3c and @xmath4o were calculated with the aim of establishing values of widths that could be expected for binding energies in the range of 100 - 200 mev . the method chosen was to couple the @xmath2 dynamically to the nucleus within the rmf approach , which is applicable throughout the periodic table , but which is disconnected from near - threshold @xmath1 phenomenology . negligible polarization effects were found for _ atomic _ states , which confirms the optical - potential phenomenology of kaonic atoms as a valid starting point for the present study . substantial polarization of the core nucleus was found in these light nuclei for deeply bound @xmath0 nuclear states . almost universal dependence of antikaon widths on its binding energy was found , for a given nucleus , suggesting that the details of how the calculated binding energy is varied over the desired range of values is largely immaterial . the widths are mostly determined by the phase - space suppression factors on top of the increase provided by the density of the compressed nuclei . the present results already provide useful guidance for the interpretation of recent experimental results @xcite by placing a lower limit @xmath108 mev on @xmath0 states in @xmath4o bound in the range @xmath91 mev . for lighter nuclear targets such as @xmath11he , where the rmf approach becomes unreliable but where nuclear polarization effects are found larger using few - body calculational methods @xcite , we anticipate larger widths for @xmath0 deeply bound states , if such states do exist @xcite . this work was supported in part by the ga avcr grant iaa1048305 and by the israel science foundation grant 131/01 .                                                        .@xmath109 bound - state spectra in @xmath110 calculated for several rmf ( nl ) lagrangians specified by different coupling - constant ratios @xmath111 and @xmath112 . the static average density for @xmath113 is @xmath114 @xmath115 .

"the higgs sector is ( so far ) an elusive basic ingredient of the fundamental theory of particle interactions . searches for higgs bosons , and the study of their properties , are one of the primary goals of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern , which is scheduled to commence taking data in the year 2007 . the conventional folklore is that ( under reasonable model assumptions ) at least one higgs boson should be discovered at the lhc . in particular , if the light higgs predicted by the standard model ( sm ) exists , it will almost certainly be found at the lhc in the first years of running or even maybe before , at the tevatron . moreover the lhc should provide a complete coverage of the sm higgs mass range . however there is a strong belief that the standard model , in its minimal form with a single higgs , can not be the fundamental theory of particle interactions . various extended models predict a large diversity of higgs - like bosons with different masses , couplings and even cp - parities . the most elaborated extension of the standard model is , currently , the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) in which there are three neutral ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) and two charged ( @xmath10 ) higgs bosons , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are cp - even ( @xmath11 ) and @xmath9 is cp - odd . just as for the standard model , this benchmark susy model has been studied in great detail ; for a recent review see  @xcite . in the mssm , the properties of the higgs sector are characterized by the values of two independent input parameters , typically chosen to be the pseudoscalar higgs boson mass , @xmath12 , and the ratio , @xmath13 , of the vacuum - expectation - values of the two higgs doublet fields . at tree level , the pseudoscalar @xmath9 does not couple to the gauge bosons and its couplings to down- ( up- ) type fermions are ( inversely ) proportional to @xmath13 . within the mssm , the mass of the @xmath7-boson is bounded to @xmath14  gev ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein ) , while the experimental 95% cl lower limit for a neutral scalar higgs is @xmath15  gev  @xcite .    beyond the standard model the properties of the neutral higgs bosons can differ drastically from sm expectations . in some extended models , the limit for a neutral higgs can go down to below 60  gev . this occurs , for instance in the mssm with explicit cp - violation , where the mass eigenstates of the neutral higgs bosons do not match the cp eigenstates @xmath16 , see , for example ,  @xcite . further examples are the models with extra dimensions where a higgs can mix with the graviscalar of the randall  sundrum scenario  @xcite , which is called the radion ( see for example @xcite ) . in the latter case , due to the trace anomaly , the gluon  gluon coupling is strongly enhanced , which makes this graviscalar especially attractive for searches in gluon - mediated processes , assuming that the background issues can be overcome . these extended scenarios would complicate the study of the neutral higgs sector using the conventional ( semi)inclusive strategies .    after the discovery of a higgs candidate the immediate task will be to establish its quantum numbers , to verify the higgs interpretation of the signal , and to make precision measurements of its properties . the separation and identification of different higgs - like states will be especially challenging . it will be an even more delicate goal to establish the nature of a newly - discovered heavy resonance state . for example , how can one discriminate between the higgs of the extended susy sector from the graviscalar of the randall  sundrum scenario ( or , even worse , from a mixture of the higgs and the radion ) . as was shown in @xcite , the central exclusive diffractive processes ( cedp ) at the lhc can play a crucial role in solving these problems , which are so vital for the higgs physics . these processes are of the form @xmath17 where the @xmath18 signs denote the rapidity gaps on either side of the higgs - like state @xmath19 . they have unique advantages as compared to the traditional non - diffractive approaches  @xcite . these processes allow the properties of @xmath19 to be studied in an environment in which there are no secondaries from the underlying events . in particular , if the forward protons are tagged , then the mass of the produced central system @xmath19 can be measured to high accuracy by the missing mass method . indeed , by observing the forward protons , as well as the @xmath20 pairs in the central detector , one can match two simultaneous measurements of the @xmath19 mass : @xmath21 and @xmath22 . moreover , proton taggers allow the damaging effects of multiple interactions per bunch crossing ( pile - up ) to be suppressed and hence offer the possibility of studying cedp processes at higher luminosities  @xcite . thus the prospects of the precise mass determination of the higgs - like states , and even of the direct measurements of their widths and @xmath20 couplings , looks feasible using these processes . a promising option is to use the forward proton taggers as a spin - parity analyser  @xcite . this may provide valuable additional ( and in some cases unique ) information in the unambiguous identification of a newly discovered state .    in section  [ sec : disoverypotential ] we illustrate the advantages of cedp ,  ( [ eq : cedp ] ) , in exploring the higgs sector in specific parameter ranges of the mssm . first in section  [ sec : icr ] we consider the so - called `` intense - coupling '' regime  @xcite where the @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 higgs decay modes are suppressed but where , on the other hand , the cedp cross section is enhanced , in comparison with the sm . next , in section  2.2 , we discuss the decoupling limit ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 ) where the light scalar , @xmath7 , looks very similar to the sm higgs . in this case the discovery of the heavier scalar @xmath8 is crucial to establish the underlying structure of the electroweak - symmetry - breaking dynamics . if @xmath28  gev , then the @xmath8 boson may be observed and studied in cedp . in section  2.3 we show that cedp may cover the `` windows '' where , once the @xmath7 boson is discovered , it is not possible to disentangle the @xmath8 or @xmath9 bosons by traditional means . in section  3 we explain how studies of cedp may help to determine the properties of the higgs - like states , once they have been discovered . the plan of the paper is first to present the predictions and then , in section  4 , to explain how the cross sections for the cedp of the @xmath19 cp - even and cp - odd higgs states are calculated . in this section we also enumerate the uncertainties in the predictions . simple formulae to approximate the cedp cross sections for @xmath29 with @xmath20 , and the corresponding qcd @xmath30 background , are given in section  5 . these allow quick , reliable estimates to be made of the signal - to - background ratio for a higgs of any mass , and both cp parities . in section  6 we focus attention on ways to identify the pseudoscalar boson @xmath9 . it is unlikely that the pure exclusive diffractive production process will have sufficient events , and so possible semi - inclusive signals are proposed and studied . the main aim of this paper is to show how the higgs discovery potential at the lhc may be enlarged by using the unique advantages of forward proton tagging . special attention is paid to the cases where the partial widths for the decay of higgs bosons into two gluons greatly exceed the sm values . as mentioned above , we shall illustrate the advantages of using forward proton tagging to study the higgs sector by giving predictions for a few examples within the mssm model . the `` intense - coupling regime '' @xcite is where the masses of all three neutral higgs bosons are close to each other and the value of @xmath13 is large . then the @xmath31 decay modes ( which are among the main detection modes for the sm higgs ) are strongly suppressed . this is the regime where the variations of all mssm higgs masses and couplings are very rapid . this region is considered as one of the most challenging for the ( conventional ) higgs searches at the lhc , see @xcite and references therein . on the other hand , here the cedp cross sections are enhanced by more than an order of magnitude ( due to the large @xmath32 couplings ) . therefore the expected significance of the cedp signal becomes quite large . indeed , this is evident from fig .  1 , which shows the cross sections for the cedp production of @xmath16 bosons as functions of their mass for @xmath33 and 50 . the cross sections are computed as described in section  5 , with the widths and properties of the higgs scalar ( @xmath34 ) and pseudoscalar ( @xmath9 ) bosons obtained from the hdecay code , version 3.0  @xcite , with all other parameters taken from table  2 of @xcite ; also we take @xmath35 , which means the radiative corrections are included according to ref . @xcite . let us focus on the main @xmath36 decay mode decay mode . the use of the @xmath37 decay mode requires an evaluation of the @xmath38 background , especially of the possibility of misidentifying gluon jets as @xmath39 s in the cedp environment . currently , for inclusive processes , the probability , @xmath40 , to misidentify a gluon as a @xmath39 is estimated to be about 0.002  @xcite . ] . this mode is well suited for cedp studies , since a @xmath41-even , @xmath42 selection rule  @xcite suppresses the qcd @xmath30 background at lo . indeed , at the lhc , the signal - to - background ratio is @xmath43 for a standard model higgs boson of mass @xmath44  gev , if the experimental cuts and efficiencies quoted in @xcite are used . this favourable ratio was obtained since it was argued that proton taggers can achieve a missing mass resolution of @xmath45  gev . due to the enhancement of the production of mssm scalars , for large @xmath13 , the qcd background becomes practically negligible . note that , normally , to estimate the statistical significance of the measurement of the signal cross section , we use the conservative formula @xmath46 for the statistical error . however when we are looking for a new particle , which gives some peak on the top of the background , the statistical error may be much lower . it is given just by the fluctuation of the background @xmath47 . on the other hand for a low number of events , it is appropriate to use a poisson , rather than a gaussian , distribution . thus the statistical significance to discover a new particle has to be evaluated more precisely . for instance , with the cuts and efficiencies quoted in [ 11 ] , we estimate that the qcd background is @xmath48 = 40(4 ) events for an integrated luminosity of @xmath49 ( 30  fb@xmath50 ) , if we take @xmath51 gev and @xmath52 gev . thus , to obtain a confidence coefficient of @xmath53 ( equivalent to a statistical significance of @xmath54 for a gaussian distribution@xcite ) , it is sufficient for the cross section of a higgs signal , times the @xmath30 branching fraction , to satisfy    @xmath55    if we take the integrated luminosity to be @xmath49 ( 30  fb@xmath50 ) .    as can be seen from fig .  1 , for mssm with @xmath56 the expected cedp cross section times branching fraction , @xmath57 , is greater than 0.7fb for masses up to @xmath58 gev . the situation is worse for pseudoscalar , @xmath9 , production , since the cross section is suppressed by the @xmath41-even selection rule . thus the cedp filters out pseudoscalar production , which allows the possibility to study pure @xmath8 production , see fig .  1 . this may be also useful in the decoupling limit , to which we now turn . for @xmath59 and @xmath60 , there is a wide domain in mssm parameter space where the light scalar @xmath7 becomes indistinguishable from the sm higgs , and the other two neutral higgs states are approximately degenerate in mass . this is the so - called decoupling limit  @xcite . moreover in many theories with a non - minimal higgs sector , there are significant regions of parameter space that approximate the decoupling limit ; see , for instance , @xcite . in this regime the discovery of the heavier non - minimal higgs scalar @xmath8 is crucial for establishing the underlying structure of the electroweak - symmetry - breaking dynamics . here , forward proton tagging can play an important role in searching for ( at least ) the @xmath8-boson , if it is not too heavy ( @xmath61  gev ) . for large values of @xmath13 the decoupling regime essentially starts at @xmath62  gev . as can be seen in fig .  1 , the cross section is still sufficiently large to ensure the observation of the @xmath8 boson up to @xmath63  gev . to illustrate the moderate @xmath13 region we consider the case @xmath64  gev and @xmath65 . then the cedp cross section is @xmath66 thus for an integrated luminosity of @xmath49 we have about 8.5 events , after applying the experimental cuts and efficiencies discussed in ref .  @xcite . the corresponding background is about 2.6  events . using again a poisson distribution , as we did in the case of ( [ eq : cc1 ] ) , then the expected statistical significance to observe such an @xmath8 boson is about @xmath67 . so detection may be feasible . the possibility to use exclusive diffractive processes to explore larger masses will depend on various experiment - related factors . in particular , on the prospects to achieve better mass resolution , @xmath68 , at higher mass , @xmath69 . there are regions of mssm parameter space where , after the @xmath7 boson is discovered , it will be difficult to identify the heavy @xmath8 or @xmath9 bosons by conventional non - diffractive processes . can the cedp processes help here ? first consider the ` notorious hole ' in parameter space ( sometimes called the `` lhc wedge '' ) , defined by @xmath70  gev and @xmath7147  @xcite . in this region , only the lightest higgs @xmath7 can be discovered even with integrated luminosity of the order of 300  fb@xmath50 . its properties are nearly indistinguishable from those of a sm higgs . unfortunately here , even for @xmath8 , the predicted cedp cross section is too low , assuming the efficiencies and cuts of ref . @xcite ; see the heavy continuous curve in fig .  2 .    however , with the present understanding of the capabilities of the detectors it is plausible that similar windows will occur in the interval @xmath72  gev for @xmath7346 . that is , it may be impossible to identify the @xmath8 scalar by conventional processes at the @xmath54 confidence level with 300  fb@xmath50 of combined atlas+cms luminosity . from the predictions shown by the dashed line in fig .  2 , we see that the part of this ` hole ' , up to @xmath74  gev , may be covered by cedp . for illustration , consider the case @xmath75  gev and @xmath76 . with an integrated luminosity of @xmath77 , the cedp cross section of ( h)_h = 0.8  fb gives about 40 events , after applying the experimental cuts and efficiencies discussed in ref . the corresponding background is about 10  events . thus , if we use a poisson distribution , as we did in the case of ( [ eq : cc1 ] ) , then the expected statistical significance to observe such an @xmath8 boson will exceed @xmath78 . recently some interesting applications of the cedp to studies of the more exotic higgs scenarios , such as models with cp violation and searches for the radions , have been discussed  @xcite . however the feasibility of applying these studies will require further critical discussion of the background issues . as was discussed in refs . @xcite , the use of cedp , with forward proton tagging , can provide a competitive way to detect a higgs boson . this approach appears to have special advantages for searches of the cp - even higgses of mssm in the intense - coupling regime . indeed , the cedp cross section can exceed the sm result by more than an order of magnitude , see fig .  1 . once a higgs - like signal is observed , it will be extremely important to verify that it is indeed a higgs boson . here we describe where forward proton tagging can provide valuable help to establish the nature of the newly discovered state and to verify whether it can be interpreted as a higgs boson . we also emphasize that cedp are well suited to study specific cases which pose difficulties for probing the higgs sector at the lhc . it is generally believed that a detailed coverage of the higgs sector will require complementary research programmes at the lhc and a linear @xmath79 collider . interestingly , in some sense , the implementation of forward proton taggers allows some studies which otherwise would have to await the construction of a linear @xmath80 collider . moreover , in addition to the other advantages , forward proton tagging offers the possibility to study new physics in the photon photon collisions , see for example  @xcite . as mentioned above , if a candidate higgs signal is detected it will be a challenging task to prove its higgs identity . unlike the conventional inclusive approaches , the very fact of seeing the resonance state in cedp automatically implies that the newly discovered state has the following fundamental properties . it must have zero electric charge and be a colour singlet . furthermore , assuming @xmath41 and @xmath81 conservation , the dominantly produced state has a positive natural parity , @xmath82 and even cp . recall that the installation of forward proton taggers also allows the attractive possibility of a spin - parity analysis . this may provide valuable additional ( and in some cases unique ) leverage in establishing the origin of the discovered candidate state . in particular , assuming cp conservation , the cedp allow the @xmath83 states to be filtered out , leaving only an ambiguity between the @xmath84 and @xmath85 states . though without further efforts the @xmath85 state can not be ruled out , this would not be the most likely choice .    as discussed in @xcite , studying of the azimuthal correlations of the outgoing protons can allow further spin - parity analysis . in particular , it may be possible to isolate the @xmath86 state . the azimuthal distribution distinguishes between the production of scalar and pseudoscalar particles  @xcite . note that with the forward protons we can determine the cp - properties of the higgs boson irrespective of the decay mode . moreover , cedp allow the observation of the interference effects between the cp - even and cp - odd @xmath87 transitions ( see @xcite ) .    following the discovery , and the determination of the basic quantum numbers , of the new state , the next step is to check whether the coupling properties match those expected for the higgs boson . for this , we need to detect the signal in at least two different channels . the cedp mechanism provides an excellent opportunity background . ] to detect the @xmath30 mode . the other decay channel which is appropriate for cedp studies is the @xmath88 decay mode ( or @xmath24 , or @xmath89 , if the event rate is sufficient ) . these measurements allow a non - trivial check of the theoretical models . for example , the precise measurement of the partial decay widths into tau and bottom quark pairs can provide a way to discriminate between supersymmetric and non - supersymmetric higgs sectors , and to probe cp - violating effects ( for recent papers see , for instance ,  @xcite and references therein ) .    for illustration , consider the following topical example , namely the intense coupling limit of mssm . as mentioned before , this regime is especially difficult for conventional inclusive studies of the mssm higgs  @xcite . on the other hand , with forward proton taggers , cedp offer an ideal probe .    for numerical purposes , we choose the same parameters as in @xcite , in particular , @xmath33 , together with results for @xmath56 . the salient features of this regime are that there is almost a mass degeneracy of the neutral higgs states , and their total widths can be quite large ( due to the @xmath90 increase ) and reach up to 12  gev . this can be seen from fig .  3 , where we plot the mass differences @xmath91 and @xmath92 , and the widths of the bosons , as a function of the pseudoscalar mass @xmath12 . it is especially difficult to disentangle the higgs bosons in the region around @xmath93  gev , where all three neutral higgs states practically overlap  @xcite . since the traditional non - diffractive approaches do not , with the exception of the @xmath23 and @xmath94 modes , provide a mass resolution better than 1020  gev , all three higgs bosons will appear as one resonance decay mode is hopeless . moreover , the vector - boson - fusion higgs production , with the @xmath30 or @xmath37 decays , does not allow the separation of the @xmath7 and @xmath8 peaks due to the poor invariant mass resolution . as shown in  @xcite , only the detection of the rare dimuon higgs decay mode may provide a chance to separate the higgs states in inclusive production . even this would require that the higgs mass splitting exceeds at 35  gev . ] . as an example , we give the expected number of cedp signal and background events for @xmath95 for @xmath96 gev , using the efficiencies and angular cuts adopted in ref .  @xcite . for @xmath13 = 30(50 ) , the number of the @xmath97 signal events , @xmath98 = 0.35(1 ) , while the qcd background is @xmath99 for @xmath52 gev . for this choice of parameters , @xmath100 gev , and the number of the @xmath101 events is @xmath102 = 30(71 ) with background @xmath48 = 3.5(3.2 ) . the corrresponding numbers for the @xmath8 boson are @xmath103 gev , @xmath104 and @xmath105 . an immediate advantage of cedp , for studying this troublesome region , is that the @xmath9  contribution is strongly suppressed , while the @xmath7 and @xmath8 states can be well separated ( @xmath106  gev ) given the anticipated experimental mass resolution of @xmath107  gev  @xcite , see fig . note that precision measurements of the two cp - even higgs states may allow a direct determination of the basic mssm parameter , @xmath13 . moreover , the forward tagging approach can provide a direct measurement of the width , becomes comparable to the mass resolution , @xmath68 , the zero - width approximation is not valid any more . therefore in calculations of the cross sections the mass resolution and large - width effects should be taken into account . ] of the @xmath7 ( for @xmath108  gev ) and the @xmath8-boson ( for @xmath109  gev ) . outside the narrow range @xmath110  gev , the widths of the @xmath7 and @xmath8 are quite different ( one is always much narrower than the other ) , see fig . 3 . recall that the width measurement can play an important role in the understanding of higgs dynamics . it would be instructive to observe this phenomenon experimentally . as discussed in @xcite , for @xmath111 the central exclusive signal should be still accessible at the lhc up to an @xmath8 mass about 250  gev . for instance , for @xmath112  gev , and lhc luminosity @xmath113 ( @xmath114 ) , about 20 ( 200 ) @xmath115 events are produced . if the experimental cuts and efficiencies quoted in dkmor are imposed , then the signal is depleted by about a factor of 6 . this leaves 3 ( 30 ) observable events , with background of about 0.1 ( 1 ) events . to calculate the cross section for the central exclusive diffractive production of @xmath117 higgs bosons rather than @xmath118 . ] we use the formalism of refs . the amplitudes are described by the diagram shown in fig . [ fig:3](a ) , where the hard subprocesses @xmath119 are initiated by gluon gluon fusion and where the second @xmath120-channel gluon is needed to screen the colour flow across the rapidity gap intervals .    ignoring , for the moment , the screening corrections of fig . [ fig:3](b ) , the born amplitudes are of the form  @xcite t_h = a^2 f_g(x_1 , x_1 , q_1 ^ 2 , ^2 ; t_1)f_g(x_2,x_2,q_2 ^ 2,^2 ; t_2 ) , [ eq : rat3 ] where the @xmath119 subprocesses are specified by @xcite @xmath121 with the nlo @xmath122 factor @xmath123  @xcite , and by the factors    l l l v_h(0^+ ) & = & ( q_- p_1 ) ( q_+ p_2 ) + v_h(0 ^ - ) & = & ( ( q_- p_1 ) ( q_+ p_2))n_0 . [ eq : rat4 ]    here @xmath124 is a unit vector in the beam direction . the @xmath125 s are the skewed unintegrated gluon densities of the proton at the hard scale @xmath126 , taken to be @xmath127 , with    l l l q_1 & = & \{q_,|(q_- p_1)| } , + q_2 & = & \{q_,|(q_+ p_2)|}. [ eq : rat5 ]    the longitudinal momentum fractions carried by the gluons satisfy @xmath128 where , for the lhc , with @xmath129  tev , we have @xmath130 , while @xmath131 . below , we assume factorization of the unintegrated distributions , f_g(x , x,q^2,^2;t ) = f_g(x , x,q^2,^2)f_n(t ) , [ eq : rat5a ] where we parameterize the form factor of the proton vertex by the form @xmath132 with @xmath133 . in the domain specified by ( [ eq : lmf_ineq ] ) the skewed unintegrated densities are given in terms of the conventional ( integrated ) densities @xmath134 . to single log accuracy , we have  @xcite . f_g(x , x,q_i^2,^2 ) = r_g ( xg(x , q_i^2 ) ) , [ eq : rat6 ] where @xmath135 is the usual sudakov form factor which ensures that the gluon remains untouched in the evolution up to the hard scale @xmath126 , so that the rapidity gaps survive . this sudakov factor @xmath135 is the result of resumming the virtual contributions in the dglap evolution . it is given by @xmath136dz\right ) . \label{eq : t}\ ] ] here we wish to go beyond the collinear approximation and in the @xmath135 factor to resum , not just the single collinear logarithms , but the single soft @xmath137 terms as well . thus we consider the region of large - angle soft gluon emission , and explicitly calculate the one - loop vertex diagram . in particular , we do not approximate @xmath138 by @xmath139 . then we adjust the upper limit of the @xmath140 integration in ( [ eq : t ] ) to reproduce the complete one - loop result gives @xmath141dk^2_\perp / k^2_\perp$ ] . the last number in the square brackets corresponds to the standard non - logarithmic contribution related to the @xmath142 term in ( [ eq : t ] ) , while the first number stems from the exact treatment of large - angle gluon radiation . this result can be incorporated in ( [ eq : t ] ) by simply choosing @xmath143 as in ( [ eq : monday1 ] ) . ] . we find = . [ eq : monday1 ] the square root in ( [ eq : rat6 ] ) arises because the bremsstrahlung survival probability @xmath135 is only relevant to hard gluons . @xmath144 is the ratio of the skewed @xmath145 integrated distribution to the conventional diagonal density @xmath146 . for @xmath147 it is completely determined  @xcite , with an uncertainty in @xmath144 of the order of @xmath148 . the apparent infrared divergence of  ( [ eq : rat3 ] ) is nullified domain  @xcite . ] for @xmath149 production by the sudakov factors embodied in the gluon densities @xmath125 . however , as discussed in ref . @xcite , the amplitude for @xmath150 production is much more sensitive to the infrared contribution . indeed let us consider the case of small @xmath151 of the outgoing protons . then , from  ( [ eq : rat4 ] ) , we see that @xmath152 , whereas @xmath153 ( since the linear contribution in @xmath154 vanishes after the angular integration ) . thus the @xmath155 integration for @xmath149 is replaced by @xmath156 for @xmath150 , and now the sudakov suppression is not enough to prevent a significant contribution from the @xmath157 domain .      to estimate the uncertainty in the predictions for the @xmath158 exclusive diffractive cross sections we first quantify the above uncertainty arising from the infrared region , where the gluon distribution is not well known . as an example , consider @xmath150 and @xmath149 production at the lhc , for @xmath159  gev and @xmath160 , using different treatments of the infrared region . we perform calculations using mrst99  @xcite and cteq6 m  @xcite partons respectively with the very low @xmath161 gluon frozen at its value at @xmath162  gev . then we integrate down in @xmath154 until @xmath163 are close to @xmath164 , where the contribution vanishes due to the presence of the @xmath135-factor . this will slightly overestimate the cross sections , as for @xmath165 the gluon density has a positive anomalous dimension ( @xmath166 with @xmath167 ) and decreases with decreasing @xmath168 . a lower extreme is to remove the contribution below @xmath162  gev entirely . even with this extreme choice , the @xmath169 cross section is not changed greatly ; it is depleted by about 20% . on the other hand , as anticipated , for @xmath86 production , the infrared region is much more important and the cut reduces the cross section by a factor of 5 .    another uncertainty is the choice of factorization scale @xmath126 . note that in comparison with previous calculations  @xcite , which were done in the limit of proton transverse momenta , @xmath170 , now we include the explicit @xmath171-dependence in the @xmath154-loop integral of ( [ eq : rat3 ] ) . we resum the ` soft ' gluon logarithms , @xmath172 , in the @xmath135-factor . so now the @xmath135-factor includes both the soft and collinear single logarithms . the only uncertainty is the non - logarithmic nlo contribution . this may be modelled by changing the factorization scale , @xmath126 , which fixes the maximal @xmath173 of the gluon in the nlo loop correction . as the default we have used @xmath160 ; that is the largest @xmath173 allowed in the process with total energy @xmath174 . choosing a lower scale @xmath175 would enlarge the cross sections by about 30% . recall that the general calculation is performed in the collinear approximation . however , when we take account of large - angle soft gluon emission in the form factor , that is in the calculation of the virtual - loop correction , as in ( [ eq : t ] ) and ( [ eq : monday1 ] ) , we go beyond the collinear approximation . the corresponding real contribution in ( [ eq : rat6 ] ) is represented by @xmath144 and the derivative of the @xmath176 factor . strictly speaking , for the case of large - angle emission there will be some small deviation from this simplified formula . this gives an extra uncertainty of the order of 10% . next there is some uncertainty in the gluon distribution itself . to evaluate this , we compare predictions obtained using cteq6 m  @xcite , mrst99  @xcite and mrst02  @xcite partons . for @xmath169 production at the lhc , with @xmath159  gev and @xmath160 , we find that the effective gluon gluon luminosity , before screening , is @xmath177 respectively . this spread of values arises because the cteq gluon is 7% higher , and the mrst02 gluon 4% lower , than the default mrst99 gluon , in the relevant kinematic region . the sensitivity to the gluon arises because the central exclusive diffractive cross section is proportional to the 4th power of the gluon . for @xmath86 production , the corresponding numbers are @xmath178 . up to now , we have discussed the effective gluon  gluon luminosity . however , nnlo corrections may occur in the @xmath179 fusion vertex . these give an extra uncertainty of @xmath180 . note that we have already accounted for the nlo corrections for this vertex  @xcite . furthermore , we need to consider the soft rescattering which leads to a rather small probability , @xmath181 , that the rapidity gaps survive the soft @xmath182 interaction , see fig . [ fig:3](b ) . from the analysis  @xcite of all soft @xmath182 data we estimate the accuracy of the prediction for @xmath183 is @xmath184 . one check of the eikonal model calculations of @xmath183 is the estimate of the diffractive dijet production rate measured by the cdf collaboration @xcite at the tevatron . the rate , when calculated using factorization and the diffractive structure functions obtained from hera data , lies about a factor of 10 above the cdf data . however , when rescattering corrections are included , and the survival probabilities computed , remarkably good agreement with the cdf measurements is obtained @xcite . combining together all these sources of error we find that the prediction for the @xmath169 cross section is uncertain to a factor of almost 2.5 , that is up to almost 2.5 , and down almost to @xmath185 , times the default value . gev , to be 2.2  fb with an uncertainty given by the range 0.95.5  fb . ] on the other hand , @xmath86 production is uncertain by this factor just from the first ( infrared ) source of error , with the remaining errors contributing almost another factor of 2.5 . here we give simple approximate formulae for the cross sections for the central exclusive diffractive production of @xmath117 bosons , @xmath186 , and for the qcd @xmath30 background as a function of mass . as was shown in ref . @xcite , the cross section may be written as the product of the effective gluon gluon luminosity @xmath187 and the cross section for the hard subprocess @xmath188 _ cedp = l . [ eq:6a]at the lhc energy , the luminosity , integrated over rapidity , may be approximated , to an accuracy of better than 10% in the interval @xmath189  gev , by = dy = \ {    c l & for  h(0^+ )  production +   + & for  h(0 ^ - )    . [ eq : integlumin ] where the mass @xmath69 is in gev . the factors @xmath190 , which are the probability that the rapidity gaps survive the soft rescattering , are 0.026 and 0.087 for @xmath149 and @xmath150 respectively . the @xmath86 amplitude contains the kinematic factor @xmath191 , which implies that in impact parameter space the fourier transform contains the factor @xmath192  @xcite . thus the @xmath86 amplitude tends to populate larger impact parameters , where the suppression caused by soft rescattering is less effective , than does the @xmath169 amplitude . the @xmath179 subprocesses cross section is , in the zero width approximation , _ h =  ( 1- )  ~_s^2(m_h^2)g_f , where @xmath193 is the fermi constant . the @xmath30 background processes were discussed in detail in ref . @xcite for a standard model @xmath194 signal , with @xmath195  gev . there were four appreciable sources of @xmath30 background , each with a background - to - signal ratio in the range @xmath1960.08 , after the appropriate cuts . in brief , these give contributions to the background subprocess cross sections of the following approximate forms    * @xmath197(@xmath30 mimicked by @xmath198 ) : @xmath199 , * @xmath200(@xmath201 admixture ) : @xmath202 , * @xmath203(@xmath204 , @xmath42 contribution ) : @xmath205 , * nlo @xmath206 contribution : @xmath207 ,    where the renormalisation scale is specified by @xmath208 . the @xmath209 superscript is to denote that each incoming gluon to the hard subprocess belongs to a colour - singlet @xmath120-channel state , see fig . [ fig:3 ] . note that all background contributions go like @xmath210 , except for ( iii ) . in addition , for fixed missing mass resolution @xmath68 , the background contains a factor @xmath211 . thus for large @xmath212  gev the background cross section behaves roughly as _ b = l _ b ~m / m^6 , while the higgs signal behaves as _ h = l _ h ~1/m^3 . to obtain a more precise behaviour one can use ( [ eq : integlumin ] ) .    in ref . @xcite we found a signal - to - background ratio @xmath213 for a @xmath195  gev standard model higgs boson . the ratio may , however , be appreciably enhanced for susy higgs with large @xmath69 , and/or large @xmath13 . it is interesting to note that , in the region where the background is larger than the signal ( @xmath214 ) , the statistical significance of the signal @xmath215 is practically independent of mass , assuming that the experimental resolution @xmath68 is mass independent . moreover , for a low mass , where @xmath30 pairs in the @xmath42 state , ( iii ) , give the dominant contribution to the background , the statistical significance increases with mass , as here @xmath216 .    finally , it is important to note that there are still various open questions which must be addressed by experimentalists in order to establish the feasibility of cedp for higgs searches at the lhc . one of the most challenging issues concerns triggering . assuming that the trigger is based on the central detector only , the main task is to reduce the rate of triggering jets in order not to reach saturation of the trigger . we present below some numbers which may be useful when considering this issue .    based on the results of ref . @xcite , we see that the cross section for the cedp of dijets with @xmath217 gev is 200 pb . if we assume that the proton tagging efficiency is 0.6 , then this yields 0.12 events / sec for a luminosity of @xmath218 . at the same time , the inclusive cross section for production of a pair of jets , each with @xmath217 gev is about 50 @xmath126b . this leads to 50,000 events / sec , which greatly exceeds the trigger saturation limit . for cms , for example , this latter limit is 100 events / sec  @xcite . therefore it appears necessary to devise additional topological requirements in the level-1 trigger for the exclusive signal , such as making use of the presence of the rapidity gaps . if the exclusive diffractive cross sections for scalar and pseudoscalar higgs production were comparable , it would be possible to separate them readily by the missing mass scan , and by the study of the azimuthal correlations between the outgoing proton momenta . however , we have seen that the cross section for pseudoscalar higgs exclusive production is , unfortunately , strongly suppressed by the @xmath41-even selection rule , which holds for cedp at lo . for values of @xmath21915 , the separation between the @xmath220 and @xmath9 bosons is much larger than their widths , see fig . . hence it might be just possible to observe the pseudoscalar in cedp . for example , for @xmath221 and @xmath222  gev , the mass separation , 3.6  gev , between @xmath7 and @xmath9 is about 8 times larger than the width @xmath223 . the cross section ( a)_a 0.15  fb , when allowing for the large uncertainties in @xmath224 , could be just sufficient to bring the process to the edge of observability . on the other hand , one may consider the semi - exclusive process ppp + jj + p , [ eq : sep ] where the higgs bosons , @xmath225 , are accompanied by two gluon jets with transverse momenta @xmath171 satisfying @xmath226  . the emission of soft gluons , with energies ( in the @xmath19 rest frame ) @xmath227 , does not affect the @xmath41-even selection rule . thus in this region the scalar @xmath8 boson will be dominantly produced in process ( [ eq : sep ] ) . on the other hand , in the domain x_i 2e_i / m_~1 we lose the selection rule and have comparable @xmath8 and @xmath9 production . moreover the azimuthal angular distribution production was mentioned in ref . however , the proof of the feasibility of such an approach in non - diffractive @xmath228 production requires further study of the possible dilution of the effect caused by parton showers ( see also  @xcite ) . an exclusive environment of the jets may be needed . ] for the gluon jets is different for the @xmath8 and @xmath9 cases . in particular , for gluons with @xmath229 accompanying @xmath9 production , the azimuthal distribution is practically flat ( at lo ) , whereas for @xmath8 production it has the form @xmath230 . this observation may be used to distinguish between @xmath8 and @xmath9 production , and to study better the properties of the @xmath9 boson . of course , we have to pay a price , of about a factor @xmath231 , to produce two extra jets with @xmath171 in the range @xmath232  gev , in a rapidity interval with @xmath233 . however , this is less than the suppression of @xmath9 production by the @xmath41-even selection rule . for @xmath234 and @xmath235  gev the cross section still exceeds 1  fb .    to gain more insight , it is informative to return to the original central exclusive diffractive process , which we sketch in fig . [ fig:3](a ) . in the equivalent gluon approximation , the polarization vectors @xmath236 of the gluons , carrying momentum fractions @xmath237 , are aligned along the corresponding gluon transverse momenta @xmath238 and @xmath239 . for very forward protons with @xmath240 , this leads to a correlation between the polarization vectors , namely @xmath241 is parallel to @xmath242 . on the other hand , the @xmath243 production vertices behave as @xmath244 and @xmath245 . therefore the exclusive diffractive production of the pseudoscalar @xmath9 boson is strongly suppressed are parallel to @xmath246 , it follows , after integration over the azimuthal angle of @xmath246 , that the lo qcd production of @xmath30 pair is also suppressed by a factor @xmath247 ; which results in a very low qcd @xmath248 background to the cedp . ] .    to change the @xmath120-channel gluon polarization we need particle emission . the best possibility would be to emit either a @xmath249 or a @xmath250 meson . unfortunately the corresponding cross sections are too low . we lose more than a factor of @xmath251 , which is a stronger suppression than that coming from the @xmath41-even , @xmath252 selection rule . for this reason we considered the possibility of emitting a ( colour singlet ) pair of gluons , that is process ( [ eq : sep ] ) . for soft @xmath253 emission , the dominant contribution comes from the term in the triple - gluon vertex which contains @xmath254 , and so does not change the gluon polarization vector . here the indices @xmath255 and @xmath256 correspond to the @xmath120-channel gluon polarization before and after the emission of the @xmath257-channel gluon . however for large @xmath258 the major contribution comes from the term with @xmath259 , where @xmath260 is the @xmath257-channel gluon polarization index . in this case after the emission , the new @xmath120-channel polarization vector is directed along the new transverse momentum @xmath261 . thus for @xmath262 the cross sections for @xmath8 and @xmath9 production are comparable , but now the lo qcd background is no longer suppressed . maybe the best chance to identify the @xmath118 boson is to observe the double - diffractive inclusive process pp x + + y , [ eq : a1 ] where both protons are destroyed . in terms of @xmath120-channel gluon polarization , this is equivalent to the limit @xmath263 in the previous reaction ( [ eq : sep ] ) . process ( [ eq : a1 ] ) has the advantage of a much larger cross section , which came from the @xmath264 integrals limited by the proton form factors , as in ( [ eq : rat5a ] ) ( see also eq.(8 ) in ref.@xcite ) , here we have logarithmic @xmath265 integrals over the intervals @xmath266 . moreover , the sudakov supression ( which arises from the requirement that no extra relatively hard gluons are emitted with transverse momenta @xmath267 in the interval @xmath268 ) is much weaker than for the exclusive process due to the larger values of @xmath151 , see @xcite . therefore the effective @xmath269 luminosity for double - diffractive inclusive production is much larger than in the cedp case . ] . however , just as for the above semi - exclusive process , we do not have the @xmath252 selection rule to suppress the @xmath248 background , nor do we have the possibility of the good missing mass resolution . on the other hand , the @xmath269 luminosity is more than order of magnitude larger than for the pure exclusive case . for example , for double - diffractive inclusive production , with the rapidity gaps @xmath270 , the luminosity is 20 times larger than that for the exclusive diffractive production of a higgs boson with mass @xmath271 gev ( see for details @xcite ) . so , even for the @xmath37 decay mode we expect a cross section , @xmath272 , of about 20  fb for @xmath9 production in the mssm with @xmath33 and @xmath273  gev . this looks promising , provided that the probability for gluon misidentification as a @xmath39 is less than 1/150 , which appears to be feasible@xcite .    despite the qcd background , the observation of the @xmath9 boson also appears to be feasible for the @xmath248 decay mode , since then @xmath274 fb which gives a signal - to - background ratio of @xmath275 . we have evaluated the qcd @xmath248 background using the lo formula for the @xmath276 cross section ( without any @xmath122 factor ) with the polar angle cut @xmath277 as was done in @xcite , and assumed a mass resolution of @xmath278 gev . the efficiency of tagging the @xmath279 jets was taken to be about 0.6 @xcite . this results in a statistical significance factor , @xmath280 , for the background then the statistical significance is about @xmath281 . ] of the signal for the @xmath9 boson of @xmath282 , for an integrated luminosity of 30 fb@xmath50 . moreover one can measure the azimuthal angle @xmath283 between the transverse energy @xmath284 flows in the forward and backward regions , that is between the total transverse momenta of the @xmath285 and @xmath286 systems . the angular dependence is driven by the momenta transferred across the rapidity gaps , and has the form & ^2 &  h(0^+ ) + and & ^2 &  a(0 ^ - ) , whereas for the qcd @xmath30 background the @xmath283 dependence is flat ( if we neglect the quark mass ( @xmath287 ) and average over the @xmath279-jet momentum direction ; see eq.(15 ) of @xcite for @xmath288 ) . thus we may suppress the @xmath289 signal by selecting events with @xmath283 close to @xmath290 . we emphasize that here we deal with rather large @xmath291 jets , @xmath292 gev , and so the angular dependences are largely insensitive to the soft rescatterings . furthermore , instead of measuring the @xmath293 of the jets ( as in ref.@xcite ) , for process ( [ eq : a1 ] ) it is enough to measure the total transverse energy @xmath284 in the forward ( and backward ) regions of proton dissociation . recall that the effective @xmath269 luminosity for the inclusive process ( [ eq : a1 ] ) was evaluated using the leading order formula . thus we can not exclude rather large nlo corrections , particularly for the non - forward bfkl amplitude . on the other hand , here , we do not enter the infrared domain . moreover , with `` skewed '' kinematics , the nlo bfkl corrections are expected to be much smaller than in forward case . so we may expect that the uncertainty of the prediction is about factor of 3 - 4 ( or even better ) . the central exclusive diffractive processes promise a rich physics menu for studying the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking , and the detailed properties of the higgs sector . we have seen , within mssm , that the expected cedp cross sections are large enough , especially for large @xmath13 , both in the intense coupling and the decoupling regimes . thus cedp offers a way to cover those regions of mssm parameter space which may be hard to access with the conventional ( semi ) inclusive approaches . this considerably extends the physics potential of the lhc and may provide studies which are complementary , both to the traditional non - diffractive approaches at the lhc , and to the physics program of a future linear @xmath79 collider . to some extent this approach gives information which otherwise may have to await a linear @xmath80 collider . we thank alfred bartl , albert de roeck , abdelhak djouadi , howie haber , leif lonnblad , walter majerotto , risto orava , andrei shuvaev , michael spira , and especially sasha nikitenko and georg weiglein , for useful discussions . adm thanks the university of canterbury ( new zealand ) for an erskine fellowship and the leverhulme trust for an emeritus fellowship . this work was supported by the uk particle physics and astronomy research council , by grants intas 00 - 00366 , rfbr 01 - 02 - 17383 and 01 - 02 - 17095 , and by the federal program of the russian ministry of industry , science and technology 40.052.1.1.1112 and ss-1124.2003.2 . cms collaboration , technical proposal , report cern / lhcc/94 - 38(1994 ) ;

"understanding the spin structure of the nucleon is one of the most important questions in strong interaction physics today . there has been renewed interest in recent years , largely as a result of a series of high  precision polarized deep inelastic scattering experiments . so far , the bulk of the information comes from measurements of the spin - dependent structure function @xmath0 . from such measurements , spin - dependent parton distributions can be extracted and compared with theoretical models , or used to make predictions for future experiments . several theoretical issues have received particular attention : the predictions of various sum  rules and the measurement of @xmath1 , the magnitude of the polarized gluon distribution , and the behaviour of the polarized parton distributions at small @xmath2 .    in a previous study @xcite we performed a global analysis of all available deep inelastic polarized structure function data in the context of the qcd  improved parton model at leading order . we supplemented the experimental information with theoretical assumptions about the flavour content and the form of the distributions at large and small @xmath2 . in particular , we presented three different sets of parton distributions characterized by qualitiatively different polarized gluon distributions , and suggested further experiments which could discriminate between them .    since the work of ref . @xcite there have been several important advances . more precise polarized structure function data has become available . both the the smc @xcite and slac e143 collaborations @xcite have measured the structure function @xmath3 of the deuteron , supplementing their previous proton target measurements , and the slac e143 collaboration has also measured the structure function @xmath4 on proton and deuteron targets @xcite . the new @xmath3 data are particularly important for determining the polarized @xmath5 and @xmath6quark distributions separately . a second advance has been the theoretical calculation @xcite of the next  to  leading order contributions to the polarized splitting functions @xmath7 which determine the @xmath8 evolution of the distributions . this not only improves the precision of the phenomenology , but also allows for the first time a consistent factorization / renormalization scheme dependence to be imposed on the analysis .    in this study we repeat the analysis of @xcite using the new polarized structure function data , but now at both leading and next  to  leading order in perturbation theory . our aim , as before , is to derive a consistent set of polarized parton distributions . at the same time we can check that the @xmath8 dependence seen in the data is consistent with the predictions of perturbative qcd . we discuss in detail the constraining power of the various data sets , the role of the polarized gluon distribution , and the prospects for future measurements . a similar analysis of polarized structure functions has been reported recently in ref . @xcite , using the ` dynamical parton model ' approach in which the distributions at small @xmath2 are generated dynamically from valence  like distributions at a small starting @xmath9 scale . a reasonable description of the data is obtained . our approach , in contrast , is to constrain the small @xmath2 distributions from the data , without prejudice as to the origin of the observed behaviour . this is in the same spirit as the unpolarized analysis of refs . @xcite . we begin by reviewing the basic theoretical input to the analysis . the fundamental quantity of interest is the structure function @xmath3 which , in analogy with the unpolarized structure function @xmath10 , can ( in the qcd  improved parton model at leading order ) be expressed in terms of the probability distributions for finding quarks with spin parallel or antiparallel to the longitudinally polarized parent nucleon : @xmath11   \\ g_1(x , q^2 ) & = & \half \sum_q\ ; e_q^2\ ;   [ \delta q(x , q^2 ) + \delta\bar q(x , q^2 ) ] , \label{naiveg1}\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath12    the first moment of @xmath0 measures the expectation value of the axial vector current between two identical nucleon states : @xmath13 where the conserved nonsinglet axial vector currents are known from the hyperon decay constants ( the ellis  jaffe sum rule @xcite ) : @xmath14 in contrast , the singlet axial vector current @xmath15 is non  conserved due to the axial anomaly . it can not be related to any other experimental quantity , although several model  dependent estimates of it can be found in the literature : if the total nucleon spin is carried only by quarks one finds @xmath16 @xcite , and if the strange quark sea in the nucleon is unpolarized then @xmath17 @xcite . both these estimates are clearly ruled out by experimental measurements @xcite , which find @xmath18 in the range @xmath19 .    in the qcd  improved parton model @xmath3 is expressed in terms of parton distributions for the polarization of quarks and gluons , @xmath20\ ; \nonumber \\ & & \times   \left\{\delta(1-y ) + { \alpha_s(q^2 ) \over 2\pi } \delta c_q(y ) + \ldots \right\ } \nonumber \\ & & + \ ; \frac{\langle e_q^2 \rangle}{2 } \int_x^1 \ ; { dy\over y}\ ;   \delta g(x / y , q^2 ) \ ; \left\ { n_f\ ;    { \alpha_s(q^2 ) \over 2\pi}\;\delta c_g(y ) + \ldots \right\}. \label{qcdg1}\end{aligned}\ ] ]    the variation of these polarized parton distributions with @xmath8 is determined by the glap evolution equation @xcite : @xmath21    for a consistent theoretical description of @xmath0 , the coefficient functions in ( [ qcdg1 ] ) must be truncated at the same order in perturbation theory as the splitting functions in ( [ evo ] ) . although the @xmath22 corrections to the coefficient functions @xmath23 @xcite and @xmath24 @xcite have been known for a long time , a next  to  leading order study was not possible until very recently , as the @xmath22 corrections to the @xmath25 were not known . these have now been published for the first time in ref . @xcite .    using the next  to  leading order evolution equations @xcite , the _ unpolarized _ parton distributions can be determined to a high level of accuracy ( see for example refs . @xcite ) using a wide variety of high  precision experimental data from different processes . as the only data available on the spin structure of the nucleon are the structure function measurements of refs . @xcite , we are still far from obtaining a similar level of precision on the polarized distributions . the appropriate choice of scheme for @xmath3 in the qcd  improved parton model has been a matter of discussion over the last few years ( see for example @xcite for a recent review ) . the main issue is the treatment of the gluonic contributions to the ellis jaffe sum rule . while the nonsinglet contributions to this sum rule can be related to conserved currents and are unambiguously defined , there is an arbitrariness in the decomposition of the singlet contribution @xcite , depending on the absorption procedure used for the axial anomaly . in the @xmath26 scheme , this anomaly is absorbed into the next  to  leading order pure singlet quark  to  quark splitting function @xcite . another possible procedure is to allow for an anomalous gluonic contribution to the ellis jaffe sum rule , which is absent in the @xmath26-scheme . the appropriate scheme transformation @xcite then yields conservation of the quark contribution to @xmath15 . in the present study we will work entirely in the @xmath26 scheme . any other choice of scheme would tie the resulting distributions to @xmath3 , as higher  order corrections to the coefficient functions of other processes are so far only known in the @xmath26 scheme . and the first moment of the polarized gluon distribution . ]    the choice of the @xmath26 scheme also allows us to use our distributions in conjunction with a broad range of unpolarized distributions , the majority of which are defined in this scheme . for reference , the @xmath26 scheme coefficient functions in ( [ qcdg1 ] ) are @xmath27    in the following section we will present the results of our leading and next  to  leading order parton model analyses of polarized structure function data . section  3 discusses the prospects of various future experiments on polarized nucleons and section  4 contains a brief summary and our conclusions . we adopt a similar approach to the global analysis of unpolarized parton distributions in the nucleon @xcite by parametrizing the polarized distributions at the starting scale in the form : @xmath28 where we take @xmath29  gev@xmath30 . the normalization factors are @xmath31 which ensures that the first moments of the distributions , @xmath32 , are given by @xmath33 .    various experimental measurements of unpolarized lepton(@xmath34)nucleon and unpolarized drell  yan cross sections yield a reasonably precise flavour decomposition of the light quark @xmath35 sea . such a decomposition is not yet possible for the polarization of the light quark sea , as measurements of the structure function @xmath3 are only sensitive to the charge weighted sum of all quark flavours , not to the individual distributions . we therefore assume a su(3)symmetric antiquark polarization @xmath36 . this _ ad  hoc _ assumption is only justified at the present level of experimental knowledge , and is furthermore immediately broken by next  to  leading order evolution @xcite . the first moments of the polarized quark distributions can be determined from the measured values of the ellis jaffe sum rule . imposing su(3)symmetry at @xmath9 , this sum rule reads @xmath37 with @xmath38 in this approach , the first moments of the valence quark polarizations are obtained from the nonsinglet axial vector current matrix elements @xcite , while the first moment of the sea quark distribution is inferred from the measured value of @xmath39 . for the leading  order ( lo ) distributions , we correct the normalization of @xmath40 and @xmath41 by the @xmath42 coefficient function in ( [ eq : gamma1 ] ) @xcite . the first moments obtained by this procedure are listed in table  [ tab : fixed ] . note that the ellis  jaffe sum rule is a ( @xmath8independent ) constant at leading order in perturbation theory , as the leading - order coefficient functions are only expanded up to @xmath43 and scaling violations in @xmath44 arise only from the splitting functions at next  to  leading order . the polarized gluon distribution enters @xmath0 at next  to  leading order . it is only very weakly constrained so far , as no experimental data are available on gluon  initiated processes such as direct@xmath45 or heavy meson production . the polarized gluon distribution @xmath46 is therefore not well  determined by a fit to the @xmath3 data alone , and so additional theoretical constraints have to be applied . it follows from the structure of the polarized splitting functions that the small-@xmath2 behaviour of the gluon and sea quark distributions are closely correlated , which justifies the assumption @xmath47 in ( [ pform ] ) . in the region @xmath48 , structure functions and their evolution are dominated by valence quark contributions , and the impact of the gluon is completely negligible . in ref . @xcite we explored various possibilities for the form of @xmath46 at large @xmath2 : hard and soft distributions with the spin aligned with that of the parent hadron , and a distribution with the spin anti  aligned . all three choices give equally good descriptions of the structure function data , but would be relatively easy to discriminate if data on polarized gluon  initiated processes were available . we adopt the same procedure here , i.e. we consider three equally possible scenarios for the behaviour of @xmath49 , which can be parametrized as follows : @xmath50 due to the introduction of the additional parameter @xmath51 in the starting parametrizations ( [ pform ] ) , these distributions look slightly different from the ones presented in @xcite . the normalization @xmath52 of the gluon distribution can only be determined consistently from the experimental data in a next  to  leading order analysis , where it still has a large error . at leading order , we can estimate @xmath52 by attributing _ all _ the violation of the ellis jaffe sum rule to a large gluon polarization and vanishing sea quark polarization . in this way we obtain @xmath53 , only slightly different from the value 1.971 obtained in ref . note , however , that at leading order the apportioning of the singlet contribution to @xmath39 between gluons and sea quarks is completely arbitrary @xcite . in fact we shall see below that a consistent nlo treatment gives a value of @xmath52 somewhat less than our estimated leading order value , and similar to the range of values found in ref . @xcite . if parton distributions are interpreted in the probabilistic picture of the naive parton model , the magnitude of the polarized distributions can not exceed the unpolarized distributions , in order to guarantee positive probabilities for the individual polarization states , i.e. @xmath54 this is in fact only a rigid constraint at leading order , since parton distibutions at higher orders are only scheme dependent constants of renormalization and not strict probability densities . the fundamental constraint at arbitrary orders in perturbation theory is the positivity of physical cross sections for all possible helicity configurations , which does not necessarily imply the positivity of the distributions . positivity of the polarized distributions is achieved by constraining the parameters of the starting distributions at @xmath9 such that @xmath55 perturbative evolution preserves the positivity of the individual helicity distributions , hence ( [ pos ] ) is fulfilled at any @xmath8 .    in our leading order analysis , we use the unpolarized distributions from @xcite for reference . at @xmath56 these are @xmath57 ( 1-x)^{6.356 } \nonumber\\ xs ( x , q_0 ^ 2 ) & = & 0.0034 ( -\ln x)^{-1.15 } ( 1 - 2.392x^{1/2}+7.094x ) ( 1-x)^{6.166 } \nonumber \\ & & \exp \left(\sqrt{-6.719\ln x}\right ) \nonumber \\ xg ( x , q_0 ^ 2 ) & = & \big [ x^{0.731}(5.110 - 1.204x-1.911x^2 ) ( -\ln x)^{-0.4718 } + \nonumber\\ & & 0.0527 \exp \left(\sqrt{-4.584\ln x}\right ) \big ] ( 1-x)^{5.566}\end{aligned}\ ] ] the reference unpolarized distributions at next - to - leading order are the a@xmath58 set of @xcite , which are parametrized at @xmath59 as @xmath60 note that the choice of unpolarized distributions is not crucial for the present analysis . all the widely available leading and next  to  leading order distributions provide very good fits to the unpolarized structure function data , and the small differences between them are much smaller than the precision with which the polarized distributions are currently determined . the flavour decomposition of the unpolarized sea quark distributions is also unimportant for our present analysis and will therefore be disregarded . the starting sea quark distribution of ref . @xcite contains a very small charm quark contribution which can safely be ignored in the present analysis . to be consistent with the evolution of the unpolarized distributions , we take @xmath61 these correspond to @xmath62 ( lo ) and @xmath63 ( nlo ) . the parameters most affected by the positivity constraints are the large-@xmath2 exponents @xmath64 . for the valence quarks , we fix @xmath65 and @xmath66 , motivated by counting rule estimates @xcite . the parameters @xmath67 and @xmath68 are constrained to be at least as large as their unpolarized counterparts in the fit , but this constraint has only minimal impact . we find that only the @xmath69 distribution tends to saturate positivity , requiring the combination @xmath70 to be limited in the fit . the data currently available on @xmath3 are not able to test the various theoretical model predictions for the small-@xmath2 behaviour of the polarized parton distributions  @xcite , which are only expected to apply at much lower values of @xmath2 @xcite . the parameters @xmath71 are therefore only effective exponents valid over some finite interval in @xmath2 . it therefore makes no sense to postulate positivity for @xmath72 by constraining the @xmath71 .

( [ a1def ] ) with @xmath3 calculated using our polarized distributions and @xmath10 calculated using the nlo unpolarized mrs(a@xmath58 ) distributions of ref . the latter are extrapolated to lower values of @xmath8 , which reproduces the full backwards evolution to within a few per cent . at large @xmath2 , there is no sensitivity to @xmath46  the evolution is completely dominated by the quark contribution . at small @xmath2 , on the other hand , we see some dependence on the gluon . in this region @xmath121 , and so the derivative @xmath122 is more negative for the sets that have a larger gluon polarization above the @xmath2 value considered . in particular , we see that at @xmath123 the proton asymmetry is almost @xmath8 independent for set c , but decreases with increasing @xmath8 for sets a and b. unfortunately , the sensitivity of the present experiments is much worse than the differences between the various sets . to illustrate this , we have included two data points at @xmath124 from the recent smc and e143 measurements . for the deuteron , the quark contribution to the structure function is smaller , and so the dependence on @xmath125 at small @xmath2 is somewhat enhanced . considering the large errors on the present data , it seems doubtful that a measurement of the polarized gluon distribution from the @xmath8 variation of @xmath82 is feasible for values of @xmath8 where perturbative expressions can be safely applied . future high statistics experiments at higher beam energies @xcite will clearly improve this measurement . it still has to be kept in mind that a determination of @xmath125 from the @xmath8 dependence of @xmath82 can never reach the quality of the corresponding unpolarized measurement , as the gluonic contribution is not as dominant in the evolution of polarized parton distributions as it is in the unpolarized evolution @xcite . inelastic @xmath116 production from a nucleon target directly probes the gluon distribution via the photon gluon fusion subprocess @xmath126 , which can be described in the colour  singlet model of ref . @xcite . depending on the virtuality of the photon , one can distinguish two different classes of events : photoproduction @xmath127 and leptoproduction @xmath128 . the emc @xcite and nmc experiments @xcite have obtained measurements of the _ unpolarized _ leading  order gluon distribution in the range @xmath129 from this process . the results agree well with gluon distributions extracted from other processes , for example large@xmath130 direct photon production . the corresponding cross section for _ polarized _ @xmath116 leptoproduction has been calculated in ref . @xcite . taking the photoproduction limit @xmath131 , one obtains @xmath132 ^ 2 }   \nonumber \\   & & \times\   [ a(z)+h\lambda c(z ) ] \;\cdot \ ; { \cal f}(p_t^2 , z ) \ ; , \end{aligned}\ ] ] with @xmath133 the polarized ( unpolarized ) cross sections are obtained by taking the difference ( sum ) over the helicity states . the polarized cross section is then proportional to @xmath134 and depends only on @xmath135 , while the unpolarized cross section is proportional to @xmath136 and depends only on @xmath137 . taking the cross sections integrated over one of the variables , one can define two physics asymmetries : @xmath138 with a photon beam of energy @xmath139 gev and cuts on @xmath140 and @xmath141 ( @xmath142  gev@xmath30 , @xmath143 , as proposed in @xcite ) , one gets significantly different asymmetries for the three gluon distributions a , b and c. predictions for the asymmetry @xmath144 , calculated using the three leading order distributions in combination with the unpolarized leading order gluon distributions of ref . @xcite , are shown in fig . note that small @xmath141 corresponds to large @xmath145 , and the ordering of the asymmetry in this region simply reflects the ordering of the different @xmath146 at large @xmath145 . due to the relatively large asymmetry of up to 15% , such a measurement could provide vital information on the leading order polarized gluon distribution for @xmath147 and @xmath148 .    in the foreseeable future , the hera collider may be able to accelerate polarized protons @xcite . this would offer the unique opportunity of measuring the polarized structure function @xmath114 far beyond the @xmath8 range of present fixed target experiments . in order to judge the quality of the new information gained from such a measurement , an order  of  magnitude estimate of the statistical errors is crucial @xcite . the structure function @xmath114 is extracted from a measurement of the asymmetry @xmath149 where @xmath150 ( @xmath151 ) denote the polarizations of the electron ( proton ) beam and @xmath152 is the kinematical depolarization of the photon . the statistical error on @xmath153 is therefore  @xcite : @xmath154 & = & \frac{1}{2\lambda_e \lambda_p } \frac{1+(1-y)^2}{1-(1-y)^2 } \left[2xf_1^p(x , q^2 ) + \frac{2(1-y)}{1+(1-y)^2 } f_l^p(x , q^2)\right ] \nonumber\\ & \times & \left ( { \cal l}_{int } \int [ \d^2 \sigma^{\rm ( unpol.)}/ ( \d x \d q^2 ) ] \d x \d q^2 \right)^{-1/2 } \sqrt{1-a_{\parallel}(x , q^2)},\end{aligned}\ ] ] where the unpolarized differential cross section is integrated over the bin used in the measurement .    to study the accuracy of a measurement of @xmath155 in the collider mode of hera , we have evaluated the above expression using the unpolarized parton distribution set mrs(a@xmath58 ) from ref . @xcite with the next  to  leading order polarized parton distribution set a described in section 2 . we apply the following cuts to the hera phase space  @xcite : @xmath156 , @xmath157 , @xmath158 and @xmath159 , and consider two scenarios for the beam energies : @xmath160 the expected errors for an integrated luminosity of @xmath161 at @xmath162 in these two scenarios are shown in fig . we take two bins per decade in @xmath2 and only one bin in @xmath8 . these results are consistent with the leading  order estimates of @xcite , bearing in mind the different cuts applied . in particular , we estimate smaller errors in the small@xmath2 region , as we apply no cuts on the hadroinc final state . the average @xmath8 values probed at hera range from @xmath163 ( @xmath164 ) to @xmath165 ( @xmath166 ) for @xmath167 and from @xmath168 ( @xmath169 ) to @xmath170 ( @xmath166 ) for @xmath171 . for reference , we also show in fig .  6 a parametrization of @xmath114 obtained from the nlo set a. to illustrate the impact of a measurement at hera , we include the three lowest datapoints reported by the smc experiment @xcite , corresponding to @xmath8 values around @xmath172 . it is apparent that a measurement at lower beam energies will yield data of higher statistical quality . in contrast , the higher beam energies yield a measurement at smaller @xmath2 . a measurement of @xmath114 at the hera collider will evidently not provide a large number of precision data on the @xmath2 and @xmath8 dependences of this structure function . hence , it will not provide sufficient information for an indirect determination of the polarized gluon density . the important physics result of such a measurement is the determination of the small@xmath2 behaviour of @xmath114 , for which various , significantly different predictions exist @xcite . it is important to stress that a measurement of @xmath114 at small @xmath2 will reduce the experimental uncertainty on the ellis jaffe sum rule . the impact of the small @xmath2 region can be easily seen in fig . 6 , as the ellis jaffe sum rule is proportional to the area enclosed by @xmath173 and the @xmath2 axis . a final remarkable point on the measurability of @xmath114 at hera is the impact on the statistical error of the minimum cut on @xmath174 . as the photon depolarizes for small @xmath174 , a small cut on @xmath174 ( such as @xmath175 ) diminishes the statistical accuracy , even though more data are included in the bin . we find that a minimal cut on @xmath174 between 0.1 and 0.2 yields the optimal accuracy . we have performed leading and next  to  leading order qcd fits to the world data on the @xmath3 polarized structure function measured with proton , neutron and deuteron targets . the quality of the fits is excellent , and from them we obtain sets of polarized parton distributions which can be used for further phenomenological analyses . the experimental precision is highest for the proton and deuteron data , and together these constrain the shapes of the valence @xmath5 and @xmath6 distributions . the sea quark and gluon distributions are still largely undetermined . there is a weak constraint on the overall size of the former , but almost no information at all on the flavour decomposition of the sea . following our earlier work , we have presented three qualitatively different gluon distributions , characterized by different behaviours at large @xmath2 . it seems that further progress in the determination of polarized parton distributions will require measurements other than @xmath3 at fixed target experiments . inelastic @xmath116 photoproduction in lepton hadron scattering has already proved capable of measuring the unpolarized gluon distribution , and a similar measurement with a polarized beam and target would provide the first real information on @xmath46 . a measurement of the @xmath8 dependence of @xmath82 can help to estimate the overall amount of gluon polarization at higher and medium @xmath2 . althogh present experiments can not provide such a measurement due to low statistics or too low values of @xmath8 , first information can be expected from the next generation of fixed target experiments . we have also studied the accuracy of a measurement of @xmath0 at the hera collider with polarized beams . such a measurement will help to discriminate between various predictions for the behaviour of @xmath0 at small @xmath2 , and will reduce the uncertainty on the ellis  jaffe sum rule from the extrapolation to small @xmath2 . financial support from the uk pparc ( wjs ) , and from

The text highlights the importance of the spin structure of the nucleon in understanding the strong interaction and its implications for particle physics.

The author begins by reviewing the current understanding of the spin structure","the distribution of the spin of the nucleon among its constituents can be parametrized in the form of polarized parton distribution functions for quarks and gluons . using all available data on the polarized structure function @xmath0 , we determine these distributions both at leading and next  to  leading order in perturbation theory . 
 we suggest three different , equally possible scenarios for the polarized gluon distribution , which is found to be only loosely constrained by current experimental data . we examine various possibilities of measuring polarized parton distributions at future experiments .

"it is safe to say that we are still a considerable distance from a satisfactory theory of quantum gravity . pursuit of this goal is taking place on many fronts , one of which involves working in a two dimensional setting . this furnishes a dynamically simplified framework for developing methods that might be generalizable to higher dimensional quantum gravity , as well as yielding potential insight into quantization of a restricted number of degrees of freedom of such theories . although the einstein vacuum field equations in two spacetime dimensions are trivial insofar as they are satisfied by any metric , it is nevertheless possible to construct dynamically interesting theories in this setting . this can be done by coupling a scalar field ( called the dilaton ) into the theory and including suitable matter sources , which typically include the dilaton itself . this has the unfortunate drawback that the theory under consideration typically does not resemble general relativity in its lower - dimensional setting , although some two - dimensional theories are equivalent to a reduction of higher - dimensional einstein gravity to spherical symmetry @xcite . however in their own two - dimensional context , such theories in general do not have a sensible newtonian limit and/or post - newtonian expansion @xcite .    however it has been shown that one can take the @xmath6 limit of general relativity by suitably rescaling newton s constant @xmath7 @xcite . the resultant theory is one in which the ricci scalar @xmath8 is set equal to the trace of the stress energy of prescribed matter fields and sources . in this sense the theory models ( 3 + 1)-dimensional general relativity in a manner not captured by other dilaton theories of gravity : the evolution of space - time curvature is governed by the matter distribution , which in turn is governed by the dynamics of space - time @xcite . referred to as @xmath9  theory , when the stress energy is that of a cosmological constant , it reduces to jackiw - teitelboim theory @xcite . an important feature of the @xmath9 theory is that it has a consistent nonrelativistic ( @xmath10 ) limit @xcite that yields ( 1 + 1)-dimensional newtonian gravity . its quantization is therefore of considerable potential interest insofar as its ( quantum ) newtonian limit can indirectly be empirically tested . this is because the effective theory of gravity near the earth s surface is ( 1 + 1)-dimensional newtonian gravity , whose potential increases linearly with separation away from the surface . from early experimental tests indicating that spin-1/2 particles undergo gravity - induced phase shifts @xcite to more recent work demonstrating that neutrons experience a quantization of energy levels in this potential @xcite , 2d newtonian quantum gravity affords an important empirical window into semiclassical quantum gravity . in attempting to understand ( at least qualitatively ) how relativistic effects could modify this behaviour the @xmath9 theory can therefore play an important role .    in this paper we take the first steps toward quantization of the @xmath9 theory . we proceed by taking as a matter source a minimally coupled pair of point particles , forming a 2-body relativistic self - gravitating system . nonrelativistic ( 1 + 1)-dimensional self - gravitating systems ( ogs ) of n particles have been very important in the fields of astrophysics and cosmology for over 30 years @xcite , since they not only furnish prototypes for studying gravity in higher dimensions , but also provide effective descriptions of physical systems whose dynamics are closely approximated by the one dimensional system . the ogs phase space is known to exhibit solutions corresponding to very long - lived core - halo configurations , reminiscent of structures observed in globular clusters @xcite . the ogs also approximates collisions of flat parallel domain walls moving in directions orthogonal to their surfaces as well as the dynamics of stars in a direction perpendicular to the plane of a highly flattened galaxy . relativistic self - gravitating systems have only been more recently studied , primarily in the 2-body @xcite and 3-body @xcite cases .    in the 2-body case a broad class of exact solutions have been obtained , with extensions that include electromagnetism and cosmological constant @xcite . the hamiltonian is explicitly known as a function of the canonical position and momentum variables . as such its quantization would yield a version of quantum gravity coupled to matter  perhaps the simplest non - trivial quantum gravity system  that affords direct comparison to a classical counterpart . however the nonlinearities of the hamiltonian yield significant challenges , eg . operator - ordering problems . here we proceed by quantizing the post - newtonian expansion of @xmath9 theory . the post - newtonian expansion for the n - body system has been previously carried out @xcite . we consider this expansion for @xmath11 , regarding the post - newtonian terms as perturbative corrections to ( 1 + 1 ) newtonian gravity . we find that relativistic corrections tend to lower the ground state energy but raise the energy of all excited states . furthermore , such corrections tend to spread the wavefunction , indicating a less tightly bound system than in the nonrelativistic case . the outline of our paper is as follows . we begin with a short review of the relativistic @xmath12-body system , outlining briefly how the exact hamiltonian for the relativistic 2-body system is obtained . we then discuss the post - newtonian expansion of this hamiltonian . in section 3 we review the quantization of the non - relativistic system and then in section 4 obtain the post - newtonian corrections to this system . in section 5 we consider the limits of validity of this approximation , and in section 6 finish off with some concluding remarks . an appendix contains some technical details associated with the perturbative calculations . we first provide a quick review of the canonical reduction of @xmath0-dimensional dilaton gravity . for the gravitational field coupled with @xmath12 point particles , the action is @xcite @xmath13 . \end{array }   \label{action}\ ] ] here @xmath14 is the metric with @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the dilaton field , @xmath8 is the ricci scalar , @xmath17 is the proper time of the @xmath18 particle , and @xmath19 is the coupling constant , where @xmath7 is the gravitational constant in two spacetime dimensions and @xmath20 is the speed of light . @xmath21 is the covariant derivative naturally associated with the metric @xmath14 , @xmath22 .    from the action ( [ action ] ) , the field equations for the @xmath9 theory are derived . upon canonical reduction of the action and field equations @xcite , the degrees of freedom of the system are @xmath23 and @xmath24 , the position and canonical momentum of the @xmath18 particle , respectively . the hamiltonian density @xmath25 is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the spatial lapalace operator , and where @xmath16 is to be viewed as a function of @xmath23 and @xmath24 , determined from the constraint conditions @xcite @xmath28 and @xmath29 with @xmath30 the conjugate momentum to @xmath31 . from this , the reduced hamiltonian of the system is then @xmath32    once the constraint equations ( [ const1 ] ) and ( [ const2 ] ) are solved , @xmath33 can then be written in terms of @xmath23 and @xmath24 . since the centre of interia momentum is conserved and its conjugate variable does not appear in the hamiltonian , the system has only two degrees of freedom : the separation @xmath34 and the canonical momentum @xmath35 of the particles . solving equations ( [ const1 ] ) and ( [ const2 ] ) for two identical particles of mass @xmath36 in the centre of inertia frame gives the hamiltonian implicilty in terms of these variables @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 is a constant satisfying @xmath40 so as to make time reversal invariance evident . function , @xmath41 ( solid ) and @xmath42 ( dot ) . ]    eq . ( [ impham ] ) can be solved explicitly for @xmath33 giving @xcite @xmath43where @xmath44note that we have used the explicit form of @xmath45 and now show the explicit dependence on @xmath20 . here , @xmath46 is the lambert @xmath47 function @xcite , defined as the solution @xmath48 to the equation @xmath49 , which has real solutions for @xmath50 . @xmath47 is in general a complex , multivalued function . for @xmath51 , @xmath47 has two real branches . the first , denoted by @xmath42 , satisfies @xmath52 . the latter , which is defined for @xmath53 , satisfies @xmath54 , is denoted by @xmath41 and is called the principal branch . see figure [ lambert ] for a plot of both branches . we will always be dealing with the principal branch @xmath55 , and will simply write for this @xmath47 . as suggested in figure [ lambert ] , we continue @xmath41 to @xmath56 . the hamiltonian ( [ exactham ] ) is exact to all orders in the gravitational coupling constant @xmath57 , meaning it accurately describes the system in both the strong and weak field regimes . expanding it in powers of @xmath1 yields the post - newtonian approximation that represents the rest energy of the system . this term can be discarded without changing the physics , and hence we will do so from now on . ] @xmath58 this gives an approximation of eq . ( [ exactham ] ) in the case of slow motion in a weak gravitational field . the hamiltonian ( [ postnewt ] ) contains a term proportional to @xmath1 , which can be removed by making the coordinate transformation @xcite @xmath59 @xmath60 the hamiltonian ( [ postnewt ] ) then becomes @xmath61 the above transformation is easily seen to be canonical by the anti - symmetry and linearity of the poisson brackets , and hence @xmath62 plays the rle of @xmath63 in @xmath64 space .    in @xmath65-dimensional gravity , terms of odd power in @xmath1 can be associated with gravitational radiation @xcite . because there exists no graviton degree of freedom in the @xmath0-dimensional case , gravitational radiation does not exist , and inclusion of such terms may be misleading . the transformed hamiltonian @xmath66 contains relativistic terms proportional only to @xmath67 , more naturally analogous to the @xmath65-dimensional case . from now on the tildes will be dropped for clarity with the understanding that only @xmath64 coordinates will be used . if we define @xmath68 , we see that @xmath69 is the appropriate hamiltonian to describe two identical particles in @xmath0-dimensional newtonian gravity . we then have @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 in the slow moving limit , for small @xmath73 and @xmath35 we see @xmath74 , so that the relativistic effects are small compared to the newtonian effects . this leads to the natural identification of @xmath75 as a relativistic perturbation to the newtonian system . note that the hamiltonian ( [ exactham ] ) is an exact result that fully encapsulates all of the degrees of freedom of the @xmath9 theory coupled to two point particles . as such , quantization of this hamiltonian is equivalent to a full quantization of the @xmath9 theory coupled to two point particles in a linear ( as opposed to circular ) topology . we proceed in the next section to quantize its non - relativistic counterpart ( [ newtham ] ) . we would first like to gain an understanding of the two particles in the unperturbed system , described by the hamiltonian ( [ newtham ] ) . under the canonical operator identifications in configuration space , @xmath76 this becomes the hamiltonian operator @xmath77 the schrdinger equation then reads @xmath78 . here , the subscript labels the wavefunctions and eigenvalues while the superscript identifies them as solutions to the unperturbed ( newtonian ) hamiltonian . because the potential @xmath79 is continuous on @xmath80 , non - negative and increases like @xmath81 , we know that the system has isolated eigenvalues @xmath82 such that @xmath83 as @xmath84 @xcite . defining @xmath85 the normalized wavefunctions are found to be @xmath86 with energies @xmath87 and @xmath88 is the airy function .    in the above , @xmath89 is the @xmath90 root of @xmath88 , labeled such that @xmath91 , @xmath92 , while @xmath93 is the @xmath90 root of @xmath94 , for which an analogous ordering holds ( prime denoting the derivative with respect to @xmath95 ) . it should be noted that for @xmath92 , @xmath96 , so that the energy eigenvalues are strictly positive and monotonically increasing to infinity . the states are non - degenerate , and by the orthonormality relationships @xmath97 @xcite and the completeness of @xmath98 in @xmath99 @xcite , the eigenfunctions ( [ newtwf ] ) form an orthonormal basis of @xmath100 . the hamiltonian ( [ hamil ] ) becomes , with the canonical operator identification in configuration space the hamiltonian operator @xmath101 . the spectrum @xmath102 and eigenfunctions @xmath103 of the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath104 were found explicitly above , and it was noted that the eigenfunctions are non - degenerate and form an orthonormal basis of @xmath105 . hence , the hamiltonian @xmath106 can be solved approximately using non - degenerate perturbation theory ferna . in the slow moving , weak field limit , we expect the effects of @xmath107 to be small as compared to those of @xmath104 . the validity of this assumption will be discussed in section 5 . for the total hamiltonian ( [ hamil ] ) , the schrdinger equation is @xmath108 . the @xmath90 wavefunction @xmath109 is written in terms of corrections to the @xmath90 newtonian wavefunction , @xmath110 , @xmath111 here , for @xmath112 , @xmath113 is the @xmath114 order correction to the unperturbed wavefunction @xmath115 . the first order correction is given by @xcite @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the inner product on the hilbert space @xmath100 defined by @xmath118 in the above , @xmath119 denotes the complex conjugate of @xmath120 . the energy eigenvalues are written in an analogous form , @xmath121 with @xmath122 defined as the @xmath114 order correction to the unperturbed energy eigenvalue @xmath82 . the first order correction to the energy eigenvalues is given by @xcite @xmath123 we are now in a position to calculate the energy and eigenfunction corrections . explicitly , the hamiltonian operator for the perturbation , @xmath124 , acting on an unperturbed state @xmath115 is @xmath125 where we have used the so - called natural ordering of operators . observe that if @xmath36 is odd and @xmath126 is even ( or vice - versa ) , we have @xmath127 . indeed , if @xmath126 is zero or even , then @xmath115 is even , and hence so too is @xmath128 , @xmath129 . then , the inner products @xmath130 vanish , as they are integrals of an odd function over an even domain . from the definition of @xmath131 , we see that this implies that the parity of a state is preserved by the perturbations , as expected since the hamiltonian ( [ hamil ] ) has parity symmetry . hence only when @xmath36 and @xmath126 are both odd ( or both even ) may @xmath132 be non - vanishing . we now introduce a useful property of the airy function that allows the explicit calculation of the desired inner products . it follows from the identity @xmath133 that we can write @xmath134 , where @xmath135 and @xmath136 satisfy the recursive relationships @xmath137 with @xmath138 and @xmath139 . for example , using the definitions of @xmath140 and @xmath141 , we get @xmath142 where @xmath143 is one of @xmath89 or @xmath93 . we therefore write for @xmath144 , @xmath145 we evaluate the above expression with @xmath146 , which gives @xmath147 . all inner products can be evaluated explicitly . after putting in the explicit form of @xmath148 , we obtain @xmath149    inserting appropriate values of @xmath89 and @xmath93 shows that @xmath150 while @xmath151 for @xmath152 . by the ordering and unboundedness of @xmath89 and @xmath93 , @xmath147 is monotonically increasing in @xmath126 without bound , and so the approximation will be valid for only finitely many states , a point we shall return to in section 5 . the magnitude of the energy corrections is expected to be quite small , as is common in quantum gravity . indeed , for the ground state , we have @xmath153 where the lower dimensionality implies that @xmath7 has the same dimensions as @xmath154 . proceeding , we can now find expressions for the perturbed wavefunctions . to do so , we evaluate ( [ innprod ] ) with @xmath36 and @xmath126 both zero or even to get @xmath155\frac{% ( -1)^{m+n+1}\left(a^{\prime}_{\frac{m+2}{2}}+a^{\prime}_{\frac{n+2}{2}}\right)}{% \left(a^{\prime}_{\frac{m+2}{2}}-a^{\prime}_{\frac{n+2}{2}}\right)^4\sqrt{a^{\prime}_{% \frac{m+2}{2}}a^{\prime}_{\frac{n+2}{2 } } } }   \label{evenprod}\ ] ] and for @xmath36 and @xmath126 both odd , @xmath156\frac{% ( -1)^{m+n}2}{\left(a_{\frac{m+1}{2}}-a_{\frac{n+1}{2}}\right)^4}. \label{oddprod}\ ] ] using eqs . ( [ fncorr ] ) , ( [ evenprod ] ) and ( [ oddprod ] ) , we have @xmath157 where @xmath158    the first order perturbed wavefunctions are thus given by , say @xmath159 for some @xmath160 , then we would now have that @xmath161 . for simplicity we omit this phase factor . ] @xmath162 it is easy to check that to second order in @xmath1 , @xmath163 is normalized . see figure [ wavefunctions ] for a plot of the perturbed wavefunctions and probability densities for increasing values of @xmath20 . @xmath164 , @xmath165 for @xmath166 @xmath167 and @xmath165 for @xmath168 @xmath169 . on the right , the plot shows @xmath170 @xmath171 , @xmath172 for @xmath166 @xmath167 and @xmath173 for @xmath168 @xmath169 . units are chosen such that @xmath174 , @xmath175 , and @xmath176 . , title=""fig : "" ]   @xmath164 , @xmath165 for @xmath166 @xmath167 and @xmath165 for @xmath168 @xmath169 . on the right , the plot shows @xmath170 @xmath171 , @xmath172 for @xmath166 @xmath167 and @xmath173 for @xmath168 @xmath169 . units are chosen such that @xmath174 , @xmath175 , and @xmath176 . , title=""fig : "" ] we now wish to calculate the expectation values of powers of @xmath177 and @xmath178 so as to compare the newtonian and post - newtonian systems , and to check the limits of validity of our perturbation results . first , some notation . we define , for @xmath179 , @xmath180 for some observable @xmath181 . we state results for the perturbed wavefunctions , which are derived using the inner product identities developed in the appendix . taking the @xmath182 limit , these also give the newtonian expectation values . we have , keeping only terms to second order in @xmath1 , @xmath183 reflecting the fact that the perturbation ( [ pertham ] ) is parity preserving . we also find @xmath184\left(\frac{\hbar^2}{2\pi g}\right)^{\frac{2}{3}}\frac{1}{m^2}% \end{array } , & \hbox { if } n \in\left\{0\right\}\cup 2\mathbb{n } \bigskip\bigskip \\ \begin{array}{l } \displaystyle\displaystyle\left[\frac{8a_{\frac{n+1}{2}}^2}{15}% + 48\sum_{m\geq0}\alpha_{mn}\frac{(-1)^{m+n+1}}{\left(a_{\frac{n+1}{2}}-a_{% \frac{m+1}{2}}\right)^4}\right]\left(\frac{\hbar^2}{2\pi g}\right)^{\frac{2}{% 3}}\frac{1}{m^2}% \end{array}% , & \hbox { if } n \in 2\mathbb{n}-1,% \end{array } \right.\ ] ] and @xmath185\left(2\pi\hbar g\right)^{\frac{% 2}{3}}m^2% \end{array}% , & \hbox { if } n \in\left\{0\right\}\cup 2\mathbb{n } \bigskip\bigskip \\ \begin{array}{l } -\left[\frac{1}{3}a_{\frac{n+1}{2}}+ 2\displaystyle\sum_{m\geq0}\alpha_{mn } \frac{(-1)^{m+n+1}}{\left(a_{\frac{m+1}{2}}-a_{\frac{n+1}{2}% } \right)^2}\right]\left(2\pi\hbar g\right)^{\frac{2}{3}}m^2% \end{array}% , & \hbox { if } n \in 2\mathbb{n}-1.% \end{array } \right.\ ] ]    we see that @xmath186 and @xmath187 depend strongly on the masses of the particles , being proportional to the inverse square and square of the mass , respectively . this dependence on mass resembles an exaggerated version of the simple harmonic oscillator ( sho ) , with @xmath188 and @xmath189 being proportional to the inverse root and root of the mass , respectively . for particles of small ( large ) mass , the square separation quickly becomes very large ( small ) and changes slowly ( quickly ) due to the @xmath190 dependence of @xmath187.it is also instructive to compare these results to those of @xmath65-dimensional newtonian gravity . in the @xmath65 case , @xmath191 and @xmath192 are proportional to @xmath193 and @xmath194 , respectively . in this sense the expectation values are an even more exaggerated version of the sho values .    , of @xmath186 ( dot ) as a function of @xmath20 and @xmath195 ( solid ) , illustrating @xmath196 . to the right , plots of @xmath197 , @xmath198 , ( dot ) as a function of @xmath20 and @xmath199 ( solid ) are shown , illustrating @xmath200 . units are chosen such that @xmath174 , @xmath175 , and @xmath176 . , title=""fig : "" ] , of @xmath186 ( dot ) as a function of @xmath20 and @xmath195 ( solid ) , illustrating @xmath196 . to the right , plots of @xmath197 , @xmath198 , ( dot ) as a function of @xmath20 and @xmath199 ( solid ) are shown , illustrating @xmath200 . units are chosen such that @xmath174 , @xmath175 , and @xmath176 . , title=""fig : "" ]    from eq . ( [ alphamn ] ) , we see that @xmath201 . using this , it is straightforward to check that we have @xmath202 for @xmath203 , @xmath204 , as claimed above . this is illustrated in figure [ expvals ] . from the expression for @xmath205 , we see that the expectation values diverge as @xmath206 . this , however , is not of concern as the approximation is valid only for large @xmath20 . higher order contributions in @xmath1 will greatly modify figure [ expvals ] for small @xmath20 , while leaving the behaviour mostly unchanged for large @xmath20 . as an example , in units such that @xmath207 , @xmath208 , and @xmath209 , we have @xmath210 and @xmath211 . setting @xmath212 , and including twenty terms ( i.e. @xmath213 ) in the sums , we get @xmath214 and @xmath215 .    denoting the dispersion of an observable @xmath181 in the state @xmath216 by @xmath217 , using the above expectation values , we see that @xmath218 it is straightforward to show that the uncertainty principle is not violated upon substituting values for @xmath89 and @xmath93 . figure [ uncertplot ] shows a plot of @xmath219 for both the perturbed and unperturbed ground state wavefunctions , as well as the lower bound @xmath220 set by the uncertainty principle . of course for small enough @xmath20 we find that @xmath221 , indicative of the limits of the validity of our approximation .

gravitational corrections to the newtonian system , we run into the problem of not knowing the appropriate values of the fundamental constants @xmath20 , @xmath233 and @xmath7 in the @xmath0-dimensional case . however if we view the @xmath9 theory as being the effective relativistic theory near the surface of the earth we can obtain a numerical value of the energy correction . the @xmath65 newtonian potential close to the surface of the earth is @xmath234 for small @xmath73 , this becomes @xmath235 on the other hand , the @xmath0 newtonian potential for the two masses is @xmath236 here the superscripts in parentheses refer to the spacetime dimension in which the quantity is valid ( where @xmath237 ) . ignoring the constant term , comparison of the two cases suggests @xmath238 which indeed provides @xmath7 with the correct units . using this , with the usual values of @xmath233 and @xmath20 , we find @xmath239 . of course the actual theory correcting newtonian gravity in @xmath65 dimensions is general relativity and not the @xmath9 theory . however the results obtained here illustrate quantitatively and qualitatively  that sensible quantum - gravitational corrections to newtonian gravity can be meaningfully computed , though the suppression of the effective 2-dimensional newton constant @xmath7 renders such effects unobservable in practice . a full quantization of the @xmath9 theory remains an interesting problem for future study . in calculating inner products involving @xmath115 , we are led to consider integrals of the form @xmath241 , @xmath242 and @xmath243 . such integrals are found in valle . we must investigate the cases in which @xmath244 and @xmath245 separately . we will show explicit calculations for the case @xmath247 , which illustrates the general procedure , and state the remaining cases as results . from valle , @xmath248 using this result for @xmath115 , with , say , @xmath126 odd , we get after setting @xmath249 , @xmath250 using the expression for @xmath89 , we see get the final result as @xmath251 @xcite , so that @xmath252 as @xmath251 @xmath253 . ] @xmath254 similarly , for @xmath126 even , we get @xmath255 for @xmath126 odd , @xmath256 while for @xmath126 even , @xmath257      again , an explicit calculation will be shown for the case @xmath247 case , while the remaining cases will be stated without derivations . from @xcite , @xmath259\left\{ai\left(x+\delta_1\right)ai^{% \prime}\left(x+\delta_2\right)\right . \\ &   &   \\ &   & \displaystyle\left .- ai^{\prime}\left(x+\delta_1\right)ai\left(x+% \delta_2\right)\right\ } \\ &   &   \\ &   & + \displaystyle\frac{2}{\left(\delta_1-\delta_2\right)^2}% ai^{\prime}\left(x+\delta_1\right)ai^{\prime}\left(x+\delta_2\right).% \end{array}\ ] ] using this result for @xmath115 , with , say , @xmath36 and @xmath126 both odd , we get after setting @xmath260 , @xmath261 using the expression for @xmath89 , we see get the final result @xmath262 for @xmath36 and @xmath126 both even , we have @xmath263 for @xmath36 and @xmath126 both odd , we have @xmath264 for @xmath36 and @xmath126 both even , we have @xmath265 this work was supported by the natural sciences & engineering research council of canada .","The text discusses the pursuit of a theory of quantum gravity, specifically the two-dimensional theory of general relativity, and its potential to be quantized.

"mannheim @xcite ( henceforth m6 ) has developed a cosmological model ( mm ) based on conformal invariance . this model has a number of attractive features , but has not so far been accepted as a viable candidate for the correct theory of gravitation , in large part because it predicts , apparently unambiguously , a negative value for the effective gravitational constant , @xmath0 . from this follows a thermal history markedly different from the usual one , and consequent difficulties in addressing questions such as primordial nucleosynthesis @xcite .    in this paper we point out a mathematical problem in the formulation of the model , and present a new approach that yields a positive @xmath0 , so that the model closely resembles the conventional one . the mm involves a scalar field , @xmath1 , in a friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) background metric . it is this field @xmath1 that we will be concentrating on in this paper . the treatment of both @xmath1 and the gravitational field in m6 is classical . important subsequent work has been done on the quantization of the fourth - order equations for the gravitational field that result from the conformal lagrangian @xcite . the scalar field , @xmath1 , however , has always been treated classically , a procedure that we will question in this paper . there are several things that are required of @xmath1 in a viable model :    @xmath2    an equation of motion that is conformally invariant . an energy - momentum tensor whose 00 component ( hamiltonian ) has an energy spectrum that is bounded below .    a constant vacuum expectation value , @xmath3 , derived from the equation of motion . the @xmath4 in the action generates the effective gravitational constant , @xmath0 .    a @xmath5 term in the action that gives the correct sign for the cosmological constant . let us see whether these criteria are met in the mm . using ( as mannheim does ) a metric signature @xmath6 , and neglecting the coupling to the fermion field , the terms in mannheim s lagrangian involving @xmath1 are ( m6 ( 61 ) ) : @xmath7    this results in an equation of motion ( m6 ( 63 ) ) : @xmath8 this equation , as required , is conformally invariant . @xmath1 is assumed to acquire a non - zero vacuum expectation value , @xmath3 , found by setting the derivative term in ( [ eq : s ] ) equal to zero . this gives @xmath9 as in @xcite ( 13 ) , with @xmath10 . further development of the model ( m6 , section 10 ) shows that , in order to meet observational criteria at the present time , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are both negative , so that @xmath4 is real and positive . the effective gravitational constant , @xmath0 , in the mm turns out to be negative ( m6 ( 224 ) ) : @xmath13 choosing units with @xmath14 . the stress tensor in the mm model is obtained by taking the variation of the action with respect to the metric , in the usual way ( m6 ( 64 ) ; a similar expression is given in @xcite ) . retaining just the terms involving @xmath1 we get @xmath15    the lagrangian ( [ eq : l ] ) is analogous to the minkowski space lagrangian for a @xmath16 field theory ( @xcite ( 7.2.14 ) , with @xmath17 ) : @xmath18    the @xmath19 term in ( [ eq : l ] ) has the `` right '' sign for an @xmath20 term . but with @xmath21 , the @xmath22 term has the `` wrong '' sign , and , in a conventional treatment , will lead to a spectrum that is not bounded below . a theory of this sort has to be treated by methods appropriate to non - hermitean hamiltonians @xcite . at the level of quantum mechanics , `` wrong sign '' @xmath16 theory is well developed . nevertheless , even in minkowski space , constructing a corresponding quantum field theory is a difficult problem , still incompletely understood @xcite . conformal cosmology will remain flawed until we can make progress in understanding the scalar field . a conformally invariant theory with a single scalar field has a unique action , m6 ( 61 ) , provided we use the familiar techniques appropriate for hermitean lagrangians . once we recognize that our theory involves a non - hermitean lagrangian , however , a new approach is suggested , that we introduce in this section . we begin by working in minkowski space , but retain @xmath23 and @xmath24 in formulae to simplify the transition to a frw space . a @xmath16 theory with a `` wrong sign '' @xmath16 term is non - hermitean but is nevertheless @xmath25 symmetric , and can be treated by the methods outlined in @xcite . the distinctive feature of this approach is the use of the @xmath26 norm in place of the usual dirac norm ; for a quantized field , @xmath27 , we write this norm as @xmath28 here @xmath29 and @xmath30 represent the usual parity and time - reversal operations , while @xmath31 represents a special operation designed to ensure the norm is real and positive definite and the theory is unitary . the @xmath31 operator has to be specifically calculated for each hamiltonian . our cosmological model is written in terms of classical fields ( expectation values , @xmath32 ) , which we take to be real . we assume @xmath33 can then be expressed as @xmath34_{\forall \rho : z^{\rho } = -y^{\rho } }   \label{eq : cptdef}\end{aligned}\ ] ] ( compare @xcite ( 78 ) ) , so that @xmath35_{\forall \rho : z^{\rho } = -y^{\rho } } s ( x ) \label{eq : normex2}\end{aligned}\ ] ] in an expression of this sort , @xmath36 and @xmath37 describe the field @xmath1 at the same physical point , but use different coordinate systems to refer to that point . take the complex conjugate of ( [ eq : normex2 ] ) , and let @xmath38 and @xmath39 : @xmath40_{\forall \rho : z^{\rho } = x^{\rho } } \left [ s^ { * } ( u ) \right]_{\forall \rho : u^{\rho } = -y^{\rho } } \nonumber \\    & = & \int { \rmd}^4 x \int { \rmd}^4 y \ , c^ { * } ( x^{\mu } - y^{\mu } ) s^ { * } ( -y ) s(x)\end{aligned}\ ] ] showing that @xmath41 must be real . we define our action by @xmath42^{\cal cpt } \frac{\partial s ( x)}{\partial x^{\nu } } \right . \nonumber \\    & & \left . { } + \frac{\sigma_m}{2 } m^2 s^{\cal cpt}(x ) s(x ) + \sigma_{\mu } { \mu}^2 \left [ s^{\cal cpt}(x ) s(x ) \right]^2 \right\ } \label{eq : imink } \end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are simply `` sign factors '' , each of which can be equal to @xmath46 . we will determine their actual values as we proceed . the energy - momentum tensor is obtained in the usual way by varying the action with respect to the metric : @xmath47^{\cal cpt } \frac{\partial s ( x)}{\partial x^{\beta } } \right . \nonumber \\    & & \left . { } + \frac{\sigma_m}{2 } m^2 s^{\cal cpt } ( x ) s(x )   + \sigma_{\mu } { \mu}^2 \left [ s^{\cal cpt } ( x ) s(x ) \right]^2 \right\ } \nonumber \\    & & \left . { } - ( -g ) ^{1/2 } \frac{\sigma_k}{2 } g^{\mu \alpha } g^{\nu \beta } \left [ \frac{\partial s ( x)}{\partial x^{\alpha } } \right]^{\cal cpt } \frac{\partial s ( x)}{\partial x^{\beta } } \right ) \nonumber   \\ & = & g^{\mu \nu } \left\ { \frac{\sigma_k}{2 } g^{\alpha \beta } \left [ \frac{\partial s ( x)}{\partial x^{\alpha } } \right]^{\cal cpt } \frac{\partial s ( x)}{\partial x^{\beta } } \right . \nonumber \\    & & \left . { } + \frac{\sigma_m}{2 } m^2 s^{\cal cpt } ( x ) s(x ) + \sigma_{\mu } { \mu}^2 \left [ s^{\cal cpt } ( x ) s(x ) \right]^2 \right\ } \nonumber \\    & & { } - \sigma_k g^{\mu \alpha } g^{\nu \beta } \left [ \frac{\partial s ( x)}{\partial x^{\alpha } } \right]^{\cal cpt } \frac{\partial s ( x)}{\partial x^{\beta}}\end{aligned}\ ] ]    setting @xmath48 , the hamiltonian is given by @xmath49^{\cal cpt } \frac{\partial s(x)}{\partial x^{\beta } } \right . + \frac{\sigma_m}{2 } m^2 \left [ s(x ) \right]^{\cal cpt } s(x ) \nonumber \\    & & \left . { } + \sigma_{\mu } { \mu}^2 \left\ { \left [ s(x ) \right]^{\cal cpt } s(x ) \right\}^2 \right ) - \sigma_k \left [ \frac{\partial s(x)}{\partial x^{0 } } \right]^{\cal cpt } \frac{\partial s(x)}{\partial x^{0 } }   \nonumber \\    & = & - \frac{\sigma_k } { 2 } \left [ \frac{\partial s(x)}{\partial x^{0 } } \right]^{\cal cpt } \frac{\partial s(x)}{\partial x^{0 } } - \frac{\sigma_k } { 2 } \left [ \nabla s(x ) \right]^{\cal cpt } \nabla s(x ) \nonumber \\    & & { } - \frac{\sigma_m}{2 } m^2 \left [ s(x ) \right]^{\cal cpt } s(x ) - \sigma_{\mu } { \mu}^2 \left\ { \left [ s(x ) \right]^{\cal cpt } s(x ) \right\}^2    \label{eq : ham}\end{aligned}\ ] ]    all four terms in ( [ eq : ham ] ) include a ( positive definite ) @xmath26 norm . by analogy with ordinary @xmath16 theory , the first two terms and the last must be positive if we are to have an energy spectrum that is bounded below . we therefore set @xmath50 . the sign of the @xmath44 term will be determined by the requirement of conformal invariance when we go to frw space . the equation of motion for @xmath1 is obtained in the usual way , by requiring the action to be stationary under small variations , @xmath51 . the appearance of @xmath52 in the action is unusual , and the variation requires some care ; details are given in the appendix . the equation of motion is given in ( [ eqapp : motion ] ) . writing @xmath50 , this becomes @xmath53 s(x ) = 0 \label{eq : motion}\ ] ]    comparing this with mannheim s equation of motion , ( [ eq : s ] ) , we infer that we go over to frw space by setting @xmath54 . since @xmath55 , we must set @xmath56 . to maintain mannheim s notation as far as possible , we will here define @xmath57 , giving the equation of motion @xmath58 s(x ) = 0 \label{eq : motion2}\ ] ]    following mannheim , we assume that @xmath1 develops a constant vacuum expectation value , calculated by setting the derivative term in ( [ eq : motion2 ] ) equal to zero . the result is the same as ( [ eq : svev ] ) , @xmath59 , where , as before , @xmath55 and @xmath60 .      we can now use ( [ eq : imink ] ) to write the action in frw space : @xmath61^{\cal cpt}_{;\mu } \left[s ( x ) \right]_{;\nu } \right . \nonumber \\    & & \left . { } - \frac{r^{\sigma}_{\;\;\sigma}}{12 } s^{\cal cpt}(x ) s(x ) + \lambda_{\rm m } \left [ s^{\cal cpt}(x ) s(x ) \right]^2 \right\ } \label{eq : ifrw } \end{aligned}\ ] ]    from this we can infer the energy - momentum tensor analogous to ( [ eq : t_mann ] ) . for a cosmological model comparable to mannheim s only the last two terms are of interest , which are @xmath62 + g^{\mu \nu } \lambda_{m } \left [ s^{\cal cpt}(x ) s(x ) \right]^2 \label{eq : t_mann2}\ ] ]    replacing @xmath32 by its vacuum expectation value , @xmath3 , we get @xmath63    the important point is that the signs of both these terms are reversed in comparison to ( [ eq : t_mann ] ) . mannheim points out ( m6 , section 10 ) that because the frw space is conformally flat , the cosmological equation of motion ( cem ) reduces to @xmath64    @xmath65 is just the sum of ( [ eq : t_mann3 ] ) and @xmath66 , the contribution from ordinary matter ( fermion fields , electromagnetic radiation , etc . ) . so our cem , analogous to m6 ( 222 ) , becomes @xmath67 or , as in m6 ( 223 ) @xmath68 with @xmath69 . the @xmath4 term defines the effective gravitational constant in the theory . we find @xmath70 analogous to m6 ( 224 ) , but wth a positive sign .    of particular interest , since it permits an analytic solution , is a model containing radiation only ( m6 , section 10.2 ) . a corresponding solution exists for the present model also ; let us see how it differs . the equation analogous to m6 ( 226 ) is ( with @xmath71 ) : @xmath72 @xmath73 @xmath74 since @xmath75 for the open geometry of the mm , all three terms in ( [ eq : omega ] ) are positive , in contrast to m6 , where @xmath76 is negative . write the solution as in m6 ( 230 ) , with @xmath77 : @xmath78 @xmath79    the first term on the right of ( [ eq : r ] ) is negative , not positive as in the mm . this means that @xmath80 must start from zero , as in the standard cosmology , not from some finite value , as in the mm . this is illustrated in figure [ fig : ccpgfigure1a_1b ] . both curves were drawn using the formula ( [ eq : r ] ) , but in the upper graph @xmath81 , while in the lower graph @xmath82 . the origin of @xmath83 is conventionally shifted in the lower graph so that @xmath84 is at point b , where @xmath85 . two curves drawn using ( [ eq : r ] ) , but with different values of parameters . ( a ) @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 . @xmath80 starts from a non - zero value at @xmath84 ( point a ) . ( b ) @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath89 . part of the curve now lies below the horizontal axis , and is non - physical . the origin of @xmath83 is conventionally shifted to b , where @xmath85 . ] the present model has two features that are not present in conventional cosmology based on einstein s equations . first , the model includes a scalar field that is essentially massless . the non - zero vacuum expectation value of this field is essential , but we have ignored any excitations . this may be permissible because the field couples very weakly to normal matter , and is difficult to observe , or it may undergo a spontaneous transition that renders it massive .    second , mannheim uses ( [ eq : motion3 ] ) for his basic cosmological equation , rather than the more complete one that results from the conformal action , m6 ( 188 ) : @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the weyl tensor , defined in m6 ( 107 ) , ( 108 ) and ( 185 ) . mannheim justifies the neglect of @xmath91 by observing that a frw metric is conformally flat , and in such a space @xmath92 . this is true , but if we are to include perturbations to the metric ( as , for example , in the study of anisotropies of the cmb ) then this neglected term may become important . we have pointed out two flaws in mannheim s conformal cosmological model . @xmath2    the model predicts , apparently unambiguously , a negative value for the effective gravitational constant , @xmath0 . the model involves a scalar field , @xmath36 , that satisfies a conformally invariant equation of motion and develops a vacuum expectation value , @xmath3 . the values of the parameters that are needed to satisfy observations lead to a `` wrong sign @xmath22 theory '' , with a hamiltonian that has a spectrum that is unbounded below . we have attempted to apply the techniques appropriate for such hamiltonians to this cosmological problem , restricting ourselves to the classical limit of field equations that are still imperfectly understood . in this limit , using assumptions that appear reasonable , we find both a positive value for @xmath0 and a positive definite spectrum for the hamiltonian . our derivation depends on one simple observation , the change of sign as we go from ( [ eq : deltaika ] ) to ( [ eq : deltaikb ] ) . the derivation presented here will remain conjectural until progress is made in two main directions :    @xmath2    the techniques that have been successfully applied to @xmath16 quantum mechanics will have to be developed to cover the corresponding quantum field theory ; this seems not to have been achieved at this time @xcite . in particular , the form ( [ eq : cptdef ] ) for @xmath33 must be shown to be appropriate at the classical level . the various manipulations we have employed are suitable for minkowski space , but more detailed investigations are needed to show whether they can legitimately be extended to a frw space .    if , on the other hand , we can accept the present model as viable , without first filling in these important gaps in our understanding , then we have to face the difficult question : how can we conclusively distinguish this model from the conventional one ?    the department of physics at washington university , in particular carl bender , have given invaluable support to this retired colleague . the action is defined in ( [ eq : imink ] ) . we will start with the simplest term , @xmath93_{\forall \rho : z^{\rho } = -y^{\rho } } s(x ) \label{eq : ima}\end{aligned}\ ] ]    let @xmath32 vary by a small amount @xmath94 . then @xmath95 will vary by @xmath96 $ ] . the variation of @xmath97 will be the sum of two terms , @xmath98 and @xmath99 : @xmath100_{\forall \rho : z^{\rho } = -y^{\rho } } \delta s(x ) \label{eq : deltaim1}\ ] ] @xmath101_{\forall \rho : z^{\rho } = -y^{\rho } } s(x ) \label{eq : deltaim2}\ ] ]    take the complex conjugate of ( [ eq : deltaim2 ] ) , and let @xmath38 , @xmath39 : @xmath102 so that @xmath103 \nonumber \\ \fl & = & \int { \rmd}^4 x \int { \rmd}^4 y \ , ( -g)^{1/2 } \sigma_m m^2 c(x^{\mu } - y^{\mu } ) { \rm re } \left\{\left [ s^{*}(z ) \right]_{\forall \rho : z^{\rho } = -y^{\rho } } \delta s(x ) \right\ } \label{eq : deltaimb}\end{aligned}\ ] ]    the @xmath104 term in the action can be treated in the same way , to give @xmath105 { \rm re } \left\ { \left [ s^ { * } ( z ) \right]_{\forall \rho : z^{\rho } = - y^{\rho } } \delta s ( x ) \right\}\end{aligned}\ ] ]    calculating the variation of the kinetic term starts just as with conventional lagrangians . we imagine a variation @xmath106 , and convert this to a variation of @xmath36 by an integration by parts , discarding a surface term . recalling that we are working in minkowski space , where the metric tensor is constant , we get @xmath107^{\cal cpt } \delta s ( x)\ ] ]    using ( [ eq : cptdef ] ) we write this as @xmath108_{\forall \rho : z^{\rho } = -y^{\rho } } \delta s ( x ) \\ \fl & = & \int { \rmd}^4 x \int { \rmd}^4 y \ , ( -g)^{1/2 } \frac{\sigma_k } { 2 } g^{\mu \nu } \left [ \frac { \partial } { \partial y^{\nu } } c(x^{\mu } - y^{\mu } ) \right ] \nonumber \\ \fl   & & \times \ , \left [ \frac{\partial s^ { * } ( z)}{\partial z^{\mu } } \right]_{\forall \rho : z^{\rho } = -y^{\rho } } \delta s ( x)\end{aligned}\ ] ]    now integrate by parts and discard a surface term : @xmath109_{\forall \rho : z^{\rho } = -y^{\rho } } \delta s ( x ) \label{eq : deltaika } \\ \fl & = & \int { \rmd}^4 x \int { \rmd}^4 y \ , ( -g)^{1/2 } \frac{\sigma_k } { 2 } g^{\mu \nu } c(x^{\mu } - y^{\mu } ) \left [ \frac{\partial^2 s^ { * } ( z)}{\partial z^{\mu } \partial z^{\nu } } \right]_{\forall \rho : z^{\rho } = -y^{\rho } } \delta s ( x ) \label{eq : deltaikb } \end{aligned}\ ] ]    the passage from ( [ eq : deltaika ] ) to ( [ eq : deltaikb ] ) is best illustrated by an example . suppose @xmath110 where @xmath111 is some fixed vector . then @xmath112_{\forall \rho : y^{\rho } = - x^{\rho } } =    n ( -1)^{n } \left ( k_{\sigma } x^{\sigma } \right)^{n-1 } k_{\mu } k_{\nu } \label{eqapp : difex}\ ] ] and @xmath113_{\forall \rho : y^{\rho } = -x^{\rho } } & = & \left [ n \left ( k_{\sigma } y^{\sigma } \right)^{n-1 } k_{\mu } k_{\nu } \right]_{\forall \rho : y^{\rho } = - x^{\rho } } \nonumber \\    & = & n ( -1)^{n-1 } \left ( k_{\sigma } x^{\sigma } \right)^{n-1 } k_{\mu } k_{\nu } \label{eqapp : difex2}\end{aligned}\ ] ]    note the change in sign from ( [ eqapp : difex ] ) to ( [ eqapp : difex2 ] ) ; it implies that the variation of the kinetic term results in @xmath114_{\forall \rho : z^{\rho } = -y^{\rho } } \delta s ( x ) \right\ } \label{eq : deltaikc}\ ] ]    now use @xmath115 for arbitrary ( possibly complex ) variations @xmath116 to get the equation of motion @xmath117 s(x ) = 0 \label{eqapp : motion}\ ] ]","The text discusses a cosmological model developed by Mannheim, which is based on conformal invariance.

"in this paper , we consider the problem of the nonparametric density deconvolution of @xmath0 , the density of identically distributed variables @xmath1 , from a sample @xmath7 in the model @xmath8 where the @xmath1 s and @xmath9 s are independent sequences , the @xmath9 s are i.i.d . centered random variables with common density @xmath10 , that is @xmath11 is a noise with known density @xmath12 and known noise level @xmath13 .    due to the independence between the @xmath1 s and the @xmath9 s , the problem is to estimate @xmath0 using the observations @xmath14 with common density @xmath15 the function @xmath16 is often called the convolution kernel and is completely known here .    denoting by @xmath17 the fourier transform of @xmath18 , it is well known that since @xmath19 , two factors determine the estimation accuracy in the standard density deconvolution problem : the smoothness of the density to be estimated , and the one of the error density which are described by the rate of decay of their fourier transforms . in this context , two classes of errors are usually considered : first the so called  ordinary smooth "" errors with polynomial decay of their fourier transform and second , the  super smooth "" errors with fourier transform having an exponential decay .    for further references about density deconvolution see e.g. carroll and hall  ( 1988 ) , devroye ( 1989 ) , fan  ( 1991a , b ) , liu and taylor  ( 1989 ) , masry  ( 1991 , 1993a , b ) , stefansky  ( 1990 ) , stefansky and carroll  ( 1990 ) , taylor and zhang  ( 1990 ) , zhang  ( 1990 ) and cator  ( 2001 ) , pensky and vidakovic  ( 1999 ) , pensky  ( 2002 ) , fan and koo  ( 2002 ) , butucea  ( 2004 ) , butucea and tsybakov  ( 2004 ) , koo  ( 1999 ) .    the aim of the present paper is to provide a complete simulation study of the deconvolution estimator constructed by a penalized contrast minimization on a model @xmath20 , a space of square integrable functions having a fourier transform with compact support included into @xmath21 $ ] with @xmath22 . comte et al . ( 2005 ) show that for @xmath23 being a positive integer , this penalized contrast minimization selects the relevant projection space @xmath20 without any prior information on the unknown density @xmath0 . in most cases , it is an adaptive estimator in the sense that it achieves the optimal rate of convergence in the minimax sense , studied by fan  ( 1991a ) , butucea  ( 2004 ) and butucea and tsybakov  ( 2004 ) . it is noteworthy that , contrary to what usually happens , @xmath24 does not correspond here to the dimension of the projection space but to the length of the support of the fourier transform of the functions of @xmath25 . thus we will refer in the following to @xmath24 as the `` length '' of the model @xmath25 .    moreover , in the context of integer @xmath23 , comte et al . ( 2005 ) provide a brief simulation which shows that the selected @xmath23 are rather small and therefore far from the asymptotic . our present study shows that it is relevant to choose @xmath22 on a thinner grid than one included in @xmath26 . thus we start by stating a modification of the results in comte et al . ( 2005 ) to take into account this thinner grid of values @xmath24 and we show that the resulting penalized minimum contrast estimator is an adaptive estimator in the sense that it achieves the optimal rate of convergence in the minimax sense . here , the penalty depends on the smoothness of the errors density and therefore we consider two cases : laplace density ( ordinary smooth ) and gaussian density ( super smooth ) . we illustrate , through examples , the influence of over - penalization and under - penalization and propose practical calibrations of the penalty in all considered cases .    then we study in very large simulations the non asymptotic properties of our estimator by considering various types of densities @xmath0 , with various smoothness properties like cauchy distribution , gaussian density and finally fjer - de - la - valle poussin - type density . we present some examples , that illustrate how the algorithm works . we give the mean integrated squared error ( mise ) for the two types of errors density , for all the test densities , for various @xmath13 , and for various sample size . our results present global tables of mise and comparisons between mise and the theoretical expected rates of convergence . lastly , the robustness of our procedure is tested in various ways : when the observations are dependent , when @xmath13 is very small ( leading to a problem of density estimation ) and when the errors density @xmath27 is misspecified or not taken into account . in those cases , we compare our procedure with previous results of delaigle and gjibels  ( 2004a , 2004b ) and dalelane  ( 2004 ) ( direct density estimation ) . the conclusions of our study are the following . our estimation procedure provides very good results ; better than the kernel deconvolution methods described and studied in delaigle and gijbels  ( 2004a ) . our estimation procedure is robust when the @xmath28 s are no longer independent and even not strongly mixing . we underline the importance of the noise level in the quality of estimation , and we check that , in the case of a very small noise , we obtain mise s that have the same order as some recent results obtained by dalelane  ( 2004 ) for direct density estimation . lastly our results show that a misspecification of the errors density slightly increases the error of estimation , but less than the use of the direct density estimator ( without deconvolving ) , as it was already mentioned in hesse  ( 1999 ) . > from a practical point of view it is important to note that our algorithm is a fast algorithm ( @xmath29 operations ) based on the inverse fast fourier transform ( ifft ) .    the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , we present the model , the assumptions , the adaptive estimator and its expected rates of convergence . in section 3 , we describe the implementation of the estimates ( see [ descri ] ) and the computations of the associated integrated squared errors ( [ mise ] ) . section 4 presents the chosen penalties ( see [ penalites ] ) and describes the framework of our simulations . the simulation results are gathered in section 5 and an appendix is devoted to the proof of our theorem . for @xmath18 and @xmath30 two square integrable functions , we denote by @xmath17 the fourier transform of @xmath18 , @xmath31 and by @xmath32 the convolution product , @xmath33 . moreover , we denote by @xmath34 . consider model ( [ model ] ) under the following assumptions . @xmath35 under assumption ( [ iid ] ) , the @xmath28 s are independent and identically distributed random variables . assumption ( [ fepspair ] ) , usual for the construction of an estimator in density deconvolution , ensures that @xmath0 is identifiable .    the rate of convergence for estimating @xmath0 is strongly related to the rate of decrease of the fourier transform of the errors density @xmath36 as @xmath37 goes to infinity . more precisely , the smoother @xmath27 , the quicker the rate of decay of @xmath38 and the slower the rate of convergence for estimating @xmath0 . indeed , if @xmath27 is very smooth , so is @xmath39 the density of the observations @xmath40 and thus it is difficult to recover @xmath0 . this decrease of @xmath41 is described by the following assumption . @xmath42 when @xmath43 in assumption ( [ regufeps ] ) , @xmath27 is usually called `` ordinary smooth '' , and when @xmath44 and @xmath45 , the error density is usually called `` super smooth '' . indeed densities satisfying assumption ( [ regufeps ] ) with @xmath45 and @xmath44 are infinitely differentiable . for instance , gaussian or cauchy distributions are super smooth of order @xmath46 and @xmath47 respectively , and the symmetric exponential ( also called laplace ) distribution with @xmath48 and @xmath49 is an ordinary smooth density . furthermore , when @xmath50 , ( [ fepspair ] ) requires that @xmath51 in ( [ regufeps ] ) . by convention , we set @xmath52 when @xmath43 and we assume that @xmath44 when @xmath53 . in the same way , if @xmath54 , the @xmath1 s are directly observed without noise and we set @xmath55 .    for the construction of the estimator we need the following more technical assumption . @xmath56 this assumption ( [ momg ] ) , quite unusual but unrestrictive , already appears in density deconvolution in a slightly different way in pensky and vidakovic  ( 1999 ) who assume , instead of ( [ momg ] ) that @xmath57 . the main drawback of this condition is that it is not stable by translation , but an empirical centering of the data seems to avoid practical problems . since rates of convergence depend on the smoothness of @xmath0 we introduce regularity conditions . @xmath58}(x)\right\}.\notag\end{aligned}\ ] ] note that densities satisfying ( [ super ] ) with @xmath59 belong to some sobolev class of order @xmath60 , whereas densities satisfying ( [ super ] ) with @xmath61 are infinitely differentiable . moreover , such densities admit analytic continuation on a finite width strip when @xmath62 and on the whole complex plane if @xmath63 . the densities satisfying ( [ entiere ] ) , often called entire functions , admit analytic continuation on the whole complex plane ( see ibragimov and hasminskii  ( 1983 ) ) .    in order to clarify the notations , we denote by greek letters the parameters related to the known distribution of the noise @xmath64 and by latin letters the parameters related to the unknown distribution @xmath0 of @xmath65 . let @xmath66 and @xmath67 . using that @xmath68 is an orthonormal basis of the space of square integrable functions having a fourier transform with compact support included into @xmath69=[-\ell_m , \ell_m]$ ] ( see meyer  ( 1990 ) ) , we denote by @xmath25 such a space and consider the collection of linear spaces @xmath70 , with @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 with @xmath74 , as projection spaces . consequently , @xmath75\},\end{aligned}\ ] ] and the orthogonal projection of @xmath0 on @xmath25 , @xmath76 is given by @xmath77 , with @xmath78 . since this orthogonal projection involves infinite sums , we consider in practice , the truncated spaces @xmath79 defined as @xmath80 where @xmath81 is an integer to be chosen later . associated to those spaces we consider the orthogonal projection of @xmath0 on @xmath79 denoted by @xmath82 and given by @xmath83      associate this collection of models to the following contrast function , for @xmath84 belonging to some @xmath25 of the collection @xmath85 @xmath86 since @xmath87 = \langle t , g\rangle,$ ] we find that @xmath88 which is minimum when @xmath89 . since @xmath90 estimates the @xmath91 distance between @xmath84 and @xmath0 , it is well adapted for estimating @xmath0 . associated to the collection of models , the collection of the non penalized estimators @xmath92 is defined by @xmath93 by using that @xmath94 is linear , and that @xmath95 is an orthonormal basis of @xmath79 , we have @xmath96 with @xmath97      the adaptive estimator is computed by using the following penalized criteria @xmath98,\ ] ] where pen ( . ) is a penalty function based on the observations and the known distribution of @xmath99 without any prior information on @xmath0 . first , the variance term @xmath102 depends , as usual in deconvolution problems , on the rate of decay of the fourier transform of @xmath27 , with larger variance for smoother @xmath27 . under assumption ( [ regufeps ] ) , for @xmath103 , the variance term satisfies @xmath104 where @xmath105    second , under assumption ( [ momg ] ) , @xmath106 is of order @xmath107 . consequently , under ( [ regufeps ] ) , @xmath108 ensures that the risk @xmath109 has the order @xmath110 finally , the bias term @xmath111 depends on the smoothness of the function @xmath0 and has the expected order for classical smoothness classes since it is given by the distance between @xmath0 and the classes of entire functions having fourier transform compactly supported on @xmath112 $ ] ( see ibragimov and hasminskii  ( 1983 ) ) . consequently , under ( [ momg ] ) , if @xmath108 , the rate of convergence of @xmath92 is obtained by selecting the space @xmath79 , and thus @xmath117 , that minimizes @xmath118 one can see that if @xmath24 becomes too large , the risk explodes , due to the presence of the second term . hence @xmath24 appears to be the cut between the relevant low frequencies used in the fourier transforms to compute the estimate and the high frequencies which are not used ( and may even degrade the quality of the risk ) . we give the resulting rates in table [ rates ] . for a density @xmath0 satisfying ( [ super ] ) , rates are , in most cases , known to be the optimal one in the minimax sense ( see fan  ( 1991a ) , butucea  ( 2004 ) , butucea and tsybakov  ( 2004 ) ) . we refer to comte et al .

lenzhen - rafi @xcite , and chaika - masur - wolf @xcite ) . we consider the limits of teichmller geodesic rays in the universal teichmller space @xmath3 corresponding to integrable holomorphic quadratic differentials . in our previous work we showed that when a holomorphic quadratic differential has no zeroes in @xmath4 , and the natural parameter maps the unit disk onto a domain in @xmath16 between the graphs of two functions , then the teichmller geodesic ray has a unique endpoint on thurston s boundary of @xmath3 , but the endpoint depends on both vertical and horizontal foliations of @xmath17 ( cf . we extend this result to all integrable holomorphic quadratic differentials on the unit disk @xmath4 . the hyperbolic plane is identified with the unit disk @xmath4 and the visual boundary of the hyperbolic plane is identified with the unit circle @xmath9 . a ( hyperbolic ) geodesic in @xmath4 is uniquely determined by it endpoints ; the space of geodesics of @xmath4 is identified with @xmath18 . let @xmath17 be an arbitrary integrable holomorphic quadratic differential on the unit disk @xmath4 . each vertical trajectory of @xmath17 has two distinct endpoints on the boundary circle @xmath9 of the unit disk @xmath4 ( cf . thus each vertical trajectory of @xmath17 is homotopic to a unique geodesic of @xmath4 relative ideal endpoints on @xmath9 . let @xmath19 be the set of the geodesics in @xmath4 homotopic to the vertical trajectories of @xmath17 ( cf . figure 1 ) . given a box of geodesics @xmath20\times [ c , d]\subset \mathbb{s}^1\times \mathbb{s}^1-diag$ ] , denote by @xmath21\times [ c , d]}$ ] any ( at most countable ) union of sub -

"there have been many reviews of positron physics over the years  @xcite . more recently @xcite and @xcite considered the subject with an emphasis on experimental measurements involving noble gas targets . the related topic of antihydrogen formation has also been thoroughly reviewed @xcite . resonances and the closely related bound states of positrons with atoms and molecules has also been extensively discussed  @xcite . this work concentrates on the progress in application of theoretical methods to scattering processes in a quantum few - body system involving positrons as projectiles and multi - electron atomic targets with explicit treatment of positronium formation . particular emphasis is on the developments taken place since the comprehensive review of positron physics by @xcite . it begins by describing the currently available theories of low - energy positron collisions with atoms and simple molecules . then it describes the development and application of the two - centre convergent close - coupling method , which explicitly treats the ps - formation processes . developments in positron physics have resulted in several technologies in medicine and material science . in medicine , the use of the positron emission tomography ( pet ) scanners help to make diagnoses of cancer detection and of certain brain function disorders . material science uses positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy ( pals ) , to analyze and design specific materials . the critical component is positronium ( ps ) formation with its annihilation providing the key signature of its origin . ps is a short - lived exotic atom of a bound positron - electron pair that has similar structure to atomic hydrogen . scattering experiments are the main tool of modern physics to learn about the structure of matter . by analyzing collision products we can extract useful information about the objects being studied . historically , ordinary matter particles like electrons and protons were predominantly used as scattering particles in experimental atomic and molecular physics . with the development of positron and antiproton beams , studies of interactions of these particles with matter became possible . the last decade has seen significant progress in low - energy trap - based positron beams @xcite . new high - resolution experimental measurements have been performed for a range of atomic and molecular targets including he @xcite , ne and ar @xcite , xe @xcite , kr @xcite h@xmath0 @xcite and h@xmath0o @xcite . the development of positron beams motivated novel experimental and theoretical studies . particularly important are the positronium - formation cross sections , see the recent recommendations of @xcite . in addition , interest has been motivated by possible binding of positrons to atoms  @xcite .    theoretical description of electron - impact ionisation ( and excitation ) processes has seen significant progress in recent years due to the development of various highly sophisticated methods including the exterior complex scaling ( ecs ) @xcite , r - matrix with pseudo - states ( rmps ) @xcite , time - dependent close - coupling ( tdcc ) @xcite and convergent close coupling ( ccc ) @xcite . a review of electron - induced ionisation theory has been given by @xcite . such problems are examples of a class where there is only one `` natural '' centre , namely the atomic centre . all coordinates are readily written with the origin set at the atomic centre . yet there are many atomic collision systems of practical and scientific interest that involve at least two centres , such as the positron - hydrogen scattering system . this is a three - body system where all the particles are distinguishable , and which allows for their rearrangement . here we have two `` natural '' centres , the atomic centre and the positronium ( ps ) centre . for positron - hydrogen scattering ionisation now splits into two separate components : the rearrangement process of ps - formation and the three - body breakup process . a proper formulation of ps - formation processes requires a combined basis consisting of two independent basis sets for each of the centres which makes theoretical studies considerably more challenging than for electron - scattering . furthermore , the positron - atom system is an ideal prototype of the ubiquitous collision systems such as proton - atom scattering , where charge - exchange processes also require a two - centre treatment , see @xcite for example . every positron - atom scattering system has an ionisation ( breakup ) threshold above which an electron may be freely ejected . at 6.8  ev below this threshold is the ps formation threshold . at higher energies excitation or ionization of the target can take place . in addition , for multi - electron targets there could be many more reaction channels such as multiple ionisation and ionisation - with - excitation . for molecular targets there could be rovibrational excitation and dissociation . another reaction channel is the positron - electron pair annihilation , which can occur at any scattering energy . in this process the positron collides with one of the target s electrons and annihilates into 2 or 3 gamma rays . theoretical @xcite and experimental studies @xcite of the annihilation process have shown that its cross section is up to 10@xmath1 times smaller than the elastic - scattering cross section . therefore the annihilation channel is often omitted from scattering calculations . the elastic scattering , excitation , ps formation and ionisation are the dominant channels of primary interest . the first theoretical studies of positron scattering from atoms date back to the 1950s , when @xcite used the first born approximation ( fba ) to describe ps - formation in e@xmath2-h collisions . the born method is based on the assumption that the wavefunction for the scattering system can be expanded in a rapidly convergent series . this approximation consists in using plane waves to describe the projectile and scattered particles . the born approximation is reliable when the scattering potential is relatively small compared to the incident energy , and thus is applicable only at high energies . therefore this method is mainly focused on high - energy excitation and ionization processes . one of the most successful methods applied to the low - energy e@xmath2-h elastic - scattering problem is the kohn variational method . the method was initially developed for scattering phase shifts in nuclear reactions by @xcite . later this method was extended to positron - hydrogen scattering by @xcite . a detailed description of the method was given by @xcite . the method is based on finding the form of the functional ( called kohn functional ) involving the phaseshift as a parametric function of the total wavefunction . requiring the functional to be stationary with respect to the variations of the parameters , generates equations for the linear parameters . the phaseshifts can be accurately obtained by performing iterative calculations and finding the values of the nonlinear parameters that make the functional stationary . the many - body theory of @xcite utilizes techniques that originated from quantum field theory . using the feynman - diagram technique the perturbation series in the interaction between particles can be written in an intuitive way . when it is applied to positron - atom scattering , however , difficulties arise due to necessity to take into account ( virtual ) ps formation . however , a finite number of perturbation - theory terms can not describe a bound ps state . @xcite developed a sophisticated method based on the many - body perturbation theory . they used an approximation by considering virtual ps formation only in the ground state . the calculations with this method showed that for elastic scattering of positrons on hydrogen ( and helium atoms ) , the virtual ps - formation contribution was almost 30% and 20% of the total correlation potential , respectively . @xcite have further improved the method by introducing the techniques for the exact summation of the electron - positron ladder diagram series . the method was applied to @xmath3 scattering below the ps - formation threshold , and resulted in good agreement with accurate variational calculations . the momentum - space coupled - channel optical ( cco ) potential method was first developed for electron - atom scattering in the 1980s by @xcite . the method relies on constructing a complex equivalent local potential to account for the ionization and the ps - formation channels . the cco method gave excellent ionization @xcite , total and ps formation @xcite cross sections for positron scattering on hydrogen . @xcite used the cco method to study excitation of atomic hydrogen from the metastable 2s state . following @xcite @xcite developed the so - called two - center two - channel eikonal final state - continuum initial distorted - wave model to calculate ps formation in the ground and the lowest excited states . they also presented a @xmath4 scaling law for formation of ps(@xmath5 ) cross sections on the entire energy range with @xmath6 varying as a function of the positron incident energy . a hyperspherical hidden crossing ( hhc ) method has been applied to positron - impact ionization of hydrogen near the threshold by @xcite . they have calculated the ionization cross - section for s , p and d - waves . the hhc has also been used to calculate partial - wave ps(1@xmath6)-formation cross sections for low - energy positron collisions with h , li and na atoms @xcite . one of the most sophisticated and commonly used methods is the close - coupling ( cc ) formalism , which is based on the expansion of the total wavefunction using the target - state wavefunctions . substitution of this expansion into the schrdinger equation yields coupled differential equations in coordinate space , or lippmann - schwinger integral equations for the t - matrix in momentum space . by solving these equations the transition amplitudes are obtained for all open channels . considerable pioneering work in this field has been done by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , who demonstrated the success of using two - centre expansions consisting of ps and atomic states .    here and below when we discuss close - coupling calculations we denote the combined two - centre basis , used to expand the total scattering wavefunction , as ( @xmath7 ) , where @xmath8 is the number of atomic ( negative - energy ) eigenstates and @xmath9 is the number of positronium eigenstates . we also use a bar to indicate ( negative- and positive - energy ) pseudostates . for instance , cc(@xmath10 ) refers to close - coupling calculations with a combined basis made of @xmath8 pseudostates for the atomic centre supplemented by @xmath9 ps eigenstates . @xcite performed the first accurate two - state cc(1,1 ) calculation . this work known as the static - exchange approximation showed a giant spurious resonance near 40  ev incident positron energy . absence of such a resonance was demonstrated by @xcite using a larger cc(@xmath11 ) calculation that included @xmath6 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13-type pseudostates for both centres . however , the cc(@xmath11 ) gave new spurious resonances above the ionization threshold . an energy - averaging procedure was used to get smooth results for the cross sections to get rid of the pseudoresonances . considerable progress in the description of e@xmath2-h has been made by @xcite by using the close - coupling approach . @xcite have performed convergence studies for the full positron - hydrogen problem at low energies . below the ionization threshold they showed good agreement of sufficiently large pseudostate close - coupling calculations and the benchmark variational calculations of ps formation by @xcite . the convergent close - coupling ( ccc ) method was first developed for e@xmath14-h scattering by @xcite . its modification to positron scattering in a one - centre approach was trivial in that electron exchange was dropped and the interaction potentials changed sign  @xcite . the ccc method with a ( @xmath15 ) basis , i.e. a single atomic - centre expansion without any ps states , gave very good results for the total , elastic , excitation and ionization cross sections at higher incident energies where the ps - formation cross section is small allowing for distinction between two experimental data sets  @xcite . the ccc calculations showed no pseudoresonances so long as a sufficiently large basis was taken . following the success of the large single - centre ccc calculations , @xcite and @xcite used a large basis for the atomic centre supplemented by a few eigenstates of ps . calculations with the ( @xmath16 ) and ( @xmath17 ) bases , made of a large atomic basis similar to that of @xcite and the three lowest - lying eigenstates of ps , gave results significantly better than those from the ( @xmath11 ) basis  @xcite . the ccc method with a ( @xmath18 ) basis was developed by @xcite to study convergence in two - centre expansions . this was applied to positron scattering on hydrogen within the s - wave model retaining only @xmath6-states in the combined basis . this work for the first time demonstrated the convergence of the ( non - orthogonal ) two - centre expansions . the convergence in all channels was only possible when two independent near - complete laguerre bases are employed on both of the centres . interestingly , the total ionisation cross section had two independently converged components . one component was coming from the atomic centre and represented direct ionisation of the hydrogen atom , the other came from the ps centre and represented ps formation in the continuum . the convergence in the case of the full positron - hydrogen scattering problem was demonstrated by @xcite . the ccc calculations with such a combined two - centre basis have shown very good agreement with the experimental measurements of @xcite and @xcite . theoretical investigations of positron scattering from helium has an additional challenge due to the complexity of the target structure . in multi - electron targets two - electron excitation ( or ionization with excitation ) channels are usually excluded . this is a good approximation as the contribution of these channels is typically two orders of magnitude smaller than the corresponding one - electron excitation processes  @xcite .    first calculations of e@xmath2-he scattering have been performed by @xcite in the fba . they used only the ground states for he and ps and obtained cross sections for elastic scattering and ps formation in its ground state . their study highlighted the importance of the ps - channel coupling with the elastic channel and thereby motivated further studies . another extensive study based on the born approximation was presented by @xcite , to estimate ps - formation cross section in arbitrary s - states . from the fba studies it became clear that more sophisticated approaches to the problem were required .    the distorted - wave born approximation ( dwba ) results are obtained by using distorted wavefunctions in first - order calculations . this method can give more accurate results than the fba down to lower energies . studies utilizing the dwba by @xcite were applied to the helium @xmath19 and @xmath20 excitations by positrons in the energy range from near the threshold up to 150  ev . although the agreement with the experimental data was not very satisfactory , the method indicated the importance of the inclusion of the polarization potential in the excitation channels at low energies . the most systematic study of the ionisation process within the framework of dwba was carried out by @xcite . they used coulomb and plane waves and also included exchange effects . they obtained good agreement with the experimental results of @xcite and @xcite over the energy range from near - threshold to 500  ev . however , the most important and difficult channel , ps formation , was not included in the early dwba studies . @xcite calculated the differential and total cross sections for the excitation of the helium @xmath21 state using the second - order dwba method . another dwba method including ps channels has been reported by @xcite for intermediate to high scattering energies . they have calculated ps - formation cross section and achieved good agreement with available experimental data above 60  ev . however , their results were not accurate for ps formation below 60  ev . considering the fact that ps formation starts at 17.8  ev and reaches its maximum around 40 ev , the applicability of this method is quite limited . @xcite applied the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) , based on many - body theory @xcite , to positron - helium scattering at low energies . by using an approximate account of virtual ps formation they obtained good agreement with the elastic - scattering experimental data of @xcite and @xcite at the lowest energies . a similar rpa method was used by @xcite to calculate positron impact excitation of he into 2@xmath22s and 2@xmath22p states . as mentioned above , @xcite developed a more sophisticated method based on the many - body perturbation theory . the calculations with this method showed that the contribution from virtual ps formation was significant . applications of the method to various atomic targets were reported by @xcite and @xcite . the kohn variational method was first applied to positron - helium collisions by humberston et al . a comprehensive study of positron - helium scattering with the kohn variational method was given by @xcite . they obtained very accurate cross sections at low energies . however , agreement with the experimental results of @xcite and @xcite for ps - formation cross section was qualitative , with a similar energy dependence but with almost 25% difference in magnitude . nevertheless , very good agreement was obtained for the total cross section below the ps - formation threshold . the cco method , mentioned earlier , was applied to positron scattering on helium by @xcite . they calculated the total and ps - formation cross sections from the ps - formation threshold to 500  ev . the calculated results agreed well with the corresponding experimental data except for the data of @xcite for the total cross section in the energy range from 50 to 100  ev . @xcite applied a polarized - orbital approximation method to low - energy elastic positron - helium scattering and obtained good agreement with the experimental results . other calculations using optical potentials were presented by @xcite and by @xcite for slow - positron scattering from helium . elastic - scattering cross sections of both reports were in good agreement with experimental data . in general , the optical - potential methods proved to be useful for calculations of total cross sections . they are problematic , however , when applied to more detailed cross sections like target excitation and ps formation in excited states . @xcite utilized the classical - trajectory monte - carlo ( ctmc ) technique to model positron scattering . the method is described fully for ion - atom collisions by @xcite and by @xcite . using this technique , @xcite calculated differential ionization cross section for positron - helium and also positron - krypton collisions . the main advantage of this method is that it can describe dynamic effects occurring in collisions . for instance , the ctmc calculations showed that the probability of positron scattering to large angles after ionising the target , may be comparable , or even much greater than , the probability of positronium formation . they suggested that the disagreement between theory and experiment above 60  ev might be resolved by accounting for the flux in the experiments measuring positronium formation due to positrons scattered to angles that allow them to escape confinement . @xcite also applied the ctmc method to helium ionization by positron impact . they obtained good agreement with experimental data of @xcite . results of ctmc reported by @xcite overestimate the recent experimental data by @xcite for the ps - formation cross section below 60  ev . this questions the applicability of the classical trajectory approach to positron scattering at low and intermediate energies . a very comprehensive study of positron - helium scattering using the close - coupling method was carried out by @xcite . they used two kinds of expansions , the first one consisting of 24 helium eigen- and pseudostates and the lowest three ps eigenstates , and the second one with only 30 helium eigen- and pseudo - states . the helium - target structure was modeled using a frozen - core approximation , which can produce good excited states , but a less accurate ground state . the atomic pseudostates were constructed using a slater basis . for the 27-state approximation , only results in the energy range above the positronium - formation threshold were given . results for lower energies were unsatisfactory , and it was suggested that this might be due to the lack of convergence from the use of an inaccurate helium ground - state wavefunction . the total cross sections from both the 27- and 30-state approaches agreed well with the experimental results of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for the energy range above the threshold of positronium formation . for lower energies , qualitative agreement was obtained in terms of the shape and the reproduction of the ramsauer - townsend minimum near 2 ev , while the theoretical results were a factor of 2 larger than the experimental data . the ps - formation cross section from the 27-state approximation was in good agreement with the experimental data of @xcite up to about 60  ev and with the data of @xcite and @xcite up to 90  ev . above 100  ev the calculations were much lower than the experimental data of @xcite and @xcite while being closer to the data of @xcite . another close - coupling calculation by @xcite , using a few helium and positronium states with a one - electron description of the helium atom , showed less satisfactory agreement with the experimental data . chaudhuri and adhikari @xcite performed calculations using only 5 helium and 3 positronium states in the expansion . their results for ps formation agreed well with the experimental results by @xcite at energies near the ps threshold and displayed a better agreement with the data of @xcite at the higher energies . however , the theoretical results were much lower than the experimental data at energies near the maximum of the cross section . @xcite applied the hyper - spherical cc approach to the problem . however , they also considered helium as a one - electron target , and thus the excitation and ps - formation cross sections were multiplied by factor of 2 . satisfactory results were obtained for the total ps - formation and he(2@xmath22s ) and he(2@xmath22p ) excitation cross sections . the method was not able to describe low - energy scattering mainly because a one - electron approach to helium is not realistic at low energies .    despite the obvious advantages of the above - mentioned close - coupling calculations in handling many scattering channels simultaneously , none was able to describe low - energy elastic scattering . in addition , the presence of pseudo - resonances in cross sections below the ionization threshold @xcite indicated that there was room for improvement . the use of the frozen - core he states also needed some attention as this yielded an inaccurate result for the ground state of helium . the first application of the single - centre ccc method to positron scattering on helium was made by @xcite , using very accurate helium wavefunctions obtained within the multi - core approximation . very accurate elastic cross section was obtained below the ps - formation threshold by using orbitals with very high angular momenta . it was suggested that the necessity for inclusion of very high angular - momentum orbitals was to mimic the virtual ps - formation processes . the method also gave accurate results for medium to high - energy scattering processes except that it was unable to explicitly yield the ps - formation cross section . interestingly , the method was not able to produce a converged result at the ore - gap region ( where only the elastic and ps - formation channels are open ) , which we shall discuss later in sec . [ intcont ] . comparison of the frozen - core and the multi - core results showed that the frozen - core wavefunctions lead to around 10% higher cross sections . @xcite demonstrated that single - centre expansions can give correct results below the ps - formation threshold and at high energies where the probability of ps formation is small , but for the full solution of the problem inclusion of the ps centre into expansions was required . the initial application of the two - centre ccc approach to the problem was within the frozen - core approximation  @xcite . it was then extended to a multi - core treatment  @xcite . while generally good agreement was found with experiment from low to high energies certain approximations made need to be highlighted . the key problematic channels are those of the type ps - he@xmath2 . electron exchange between ps and he@xmath2 is neglected . excitation of he@xmath2 is also neglected . while these may seem reasonable approximations for the helium target due to its very high ionisation threshold ( 24.6  ev for he and 54.4  ev for he@xmath2 ) , they become more problematic for quasi two - electron targets such as magnesium , discussed below .    positron scattering from the helium @xmath23 metastable state has been theoretically studied for the first time by @xcite at low and intermediate energies . converged results for the total , ps - formation and breakup cross sections have been obtained with a high degree of convergence . the obtained cross sections turned out to be significantly larger than those for scattering from the helium ground state . alkali atoms have an ionisation threshold that is lower than 6.8  ev . consequently , for positron scattering on alkalis the elastic and ps - formation channels are open at all incident - positron energies . for this reason , theory has to treat appropriately the `` competition '' for the valence electron between the two positively charged centers , the singly - charged ionic core and the positron . positron scattering on the lithium target was investigated by @xcite using a one - center expansion . however , convergence was poor due to the absence of ps - formation channels @xcite . two - center expansion was employed by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . as expected , these approaches gave better agreement with the experiment . for positron - lithium case the two - center ccc approach to positron collisions with lithium was reported by @xcite . this is the most comprehensive study of the problem on an energy range spanning six orders of magnitude . while convergence was clearly established , and agreement with experiment for the total ps - formation cross section  @xcite is satisfactory , smaller experimental uncertainties would be helpful to provide a more stringent test of the theory . positron scattering from atomic sodium has been intensively studied for more than two decades . the first theoretical calculations relied on simple two - center decomposition of the system wavefunction with only the ground states of sodium and ps atoms taken into account @xcite . then , @xcite conducted more complex close - coupling calculations , adding several low - lying excited states for each positively - charged center . the obtained results turned out to be in reasonably good agreement with experimental data for both total @xcite and ps - formation @xcite cross sections . further enlargement of the number of channels in the close - coupling calculations revealed that the theoretical ps - formation cross sections @xcite deviated systematically from the experimental results for low impact energies . the experiment showed that the ps - formation cross section became larger with decreasing energy while the most refined theoretical calculations utilizing different methods of solution predicted consistently the opposite .    to resolve the discrepancy @xcite conducted the experimental study on ps formation in positron collisions with li and na atoms . this experiment confirmed the earlier results of @xcite . the authors managed to extend the impact - energy range down to 0.1 ev where the discrepancy between the theory and experiment was even larger for sodium . in striking contrast , for lithium the reasonable agreement of the measured cross section with the theoretical predictions was obtained with the use of the same methodology . @xcite applied the optical - potential approach . they found that their theoretical cross section increases with the decrease in the impact energies below 1  ev , but faster than the experimental results . unfortunately , this result was obtained with the use of some approximations , whose validity were not analyzed . it would be instructive if the same optical - potential approach was applied to the case of positron scattering on lithium . @xcite calculated ps - formation in positron - alkali collisions with the use of the hyper - spherical close - coupling method . their results support the previous theoretical data @xcite . large two - center ccc calculations of positron scattering by atomic sodium were reported by @xcite . despite being the most comprehensive to date there was no resolution of the discrepancy with experiment for ps formation at low energies , which we will highlight in sec  [ alkali - results ] . while the lighter alkali atoms are well - modeled by a frozen - core hartree - fock approximation , or even an equivalent local core potential , the heavier ones become more problematic . with a reduced ionisation threshold positron interaction with the core electrons , either directly or via exchange of the valence and the core electrons , becomes a more important component of the interaction . to the best of our knowledge this has not been addressed to a demonstrable level of convergence by any theory . nevertheless , assuming that such problems are more likely to be a problem at the higher energies , @xcite considered threshold behaviour of the elastic and ps - cross sections , and their convergence properties at near - zero energies for li , na and k. this work confirmed the expected threshold law proposed by @xcite , but was unable to resolve the discrepancy with the positron - sodium experiment at low energies . some earlier studies by @xcite and @xcite at low to intermediate energies were performed at a time when convergence was computationally impossible to establish . @xcite further developed the cco method to study positron scattering on rubidium at intermediate and high energies . they calculated the ps - formation and total cross sections . their total cross section results appear to overestimate the experiment .    though outside the scope of this review we note that the complex scaling method was recently used to study resonance phenomena in positron scattering on sodium  @xcite and potassium  @xcite . magnesium can be thought of as a quasi two - electron target with the core electrons being treated by the self - consistent field hartree - fock approach . positron scattering on magnesium is particularly interesting due to a large resonance in elastic scattering identified at low energies by @xcite . this was confirmed , though at a slightly different energy , by the one - centre calculations of @xcite which were able to be taken to convergence in the energy region where only elastic scattering was possible . minor structure differences are likely to be responsible for the small variation in the position of the resonance . two - centre ccc calculations  @xcite also reproduced the resonance , but had to make substantial approximations when treating the ps - mg@xmath2 interaction . this is even more problematic than in the case of helium discussed above since now we have a multi - electron hartree - fock core . agreement with experiment is somewhat variable , but there are substantial experimental uncertainties , particularly in the ps - formation cross section . other theoretical studies of positron - magnesium scattering include those by @xcite . inert gases heavier than helium represent a particular challenge for theory , which is unfortunate because they are readily accessible experimentally  @xcite . just the target structure is quite complicated , but some good progress has been made in the case of electron scattering by @xcite . for positron scattering once ps forms , the residual ion is of the open - shell type making full electron exchange incorporation particularly problematic . the relatively high ionisation thresholds for such targets mean that there is always a substantial ore gap where the ps - formation cross section may be quite large , but unable to be obtained in one - centre calculations which are constrained to have only elastic scattering as the open channel . nevertheless , outside the extended ore gap , formed by the ps - formation and the ionisation thresholds , one - centre ccc calculations can yield convergent results in good agreement with experiment  @xcite . there are also first - order perturbative calculations by @xcite and some based on close - coupling with convergence not fully established , see @xcite . @xcite studied positron scattering and annihilation on noble - gas atoms using many - body theory at energies below the ps - formation threshold . they demonstrated that at low energies , the many - body theory is capable of providing accurate results . @xcite used an impulse approximation to describe ps scattering on inert gases and provided quantitative theoretical explanation for the experimentally - observed similarity between the ps and electron scattering for equal projectile velocities @xcite . according to @xcite this happens due to the relatively weak binding and diffuse nature of ps , and the fact that electrons scatter more strongly than positrons off atomic targets . @xcite developed a model - potential approach to positron scattering on noble - gas atoms based on an adiabatic method that treats the positron as a light nucleus . the method was applied to calculate the elastic cross section below the ps - formation threshold . positron collisions with molecular hydrogen have been studied extensively by various experimental groups over the last 30 years @xcite . theoretical studies of this scattering system are challenging because of the complexities associated with the molecular structure and its non - spherical nature . rearrangement processes add another degree of complexity to the problem . until recently theoretical studies @xcite have been focused only at certain energy regions . in addition , there are few theoretical studies which include the ps - formation channels explicitly . the first calculations of ps - formation cross section @xcite were obtained with the use of the first born approximation . @xcite used a coupled - static model , which only included the ground states of h@xmath0 and ps . this simple model was until recently the only coupled - channel calculation available . comprehensive review of the positron interactions with atoms and molecules has been given by @xcite . @xcite have recently reported the total cross section for positron scattering from the ground state of h@xmath0 below the ps - formation threshold using density functional theory with a single - center expansion . their results are in good agreement with recent single - centre ccc calculations of @xcite below 1  ev . @xcite have also performed analysis of experimental and theoretical uncertainties using a modified effective range theory ( mert ) . they concluded that a practically constant value of the total cross section between 3  ev and the ps - formation threshold is likely to be an effect of virtual ps formation . the recent single - centre ccc calculations of positron scattering on molecular hydrogen by @xcite and antiproton collisions with h@xmath0 by @xcite have shown that the ccc formalism can also be successfully applied to molecular targets . in order to obtain explicit ps - formation cross section a two - centre approach is required , with the first attempt presented by @xcite . they found some major challenges associated with the ps - h@xmath24 channel . some severe approximations were required in order to manage the non - spherical h@xmath24 ion . nevertheless , some good agreement with experiment was found , see sec . [ h2-results ] , but considerably more work is required .      a major application of positron - hydrogen scattering is to provide a mechanism for antihydrogen formation . the idea is fairly simple , with some accurate calculations performed quite some time ago  @xcite . the basic idea is to time reverse the ps - formation process to hydrogen formation from ps scattering on a proton , and then to use the resultant cross sections for the case where the proton is replaced by an antiproton , and hence forming antihydrogen @xmath25 the advantage of antihydrogen formation via this process is that it is exothermic and so the cross section tends to infinity as the relative energy goes to zero  @xcite . this behaviour is enhanced in the case of excited states with degenerate energy levels  @xcite . antihydrogen formation is presently particularly topical due to several groups ( aegis  @xcite , gbar  @xcite , atrap  @xcite , asacusa  @xcite and alpha  @xcite ) attempting to make it in sufficient quantity in order to perform spectroscopic and gravitational experiments . @xcite provided ccc results for ps energy starting at @xmath26  ev , which suffices for currently experimentally accessible energies of around 25  mev . recent calculations of the cross sections for these processes will be discussed in sec . [ antih ] .    in this section we gave a general historical overview of various theoretical developments related to positron scattering on atomic targets and the h@xmath0 molecule . in the next section we consider in some detail basic features of the coupled - channel formalism mainly in the context of convergent close - coupling method and discuss the latest results . here we describe basics of the close coupling approach based on the momentum - space integral equations . we consider the simplest case of scattering in a system of three particles : positron ( to be denoted @xmath27 ) , proton ( @xmath28 ) and electron ( @xmath29 ) . let us also call @xmath27 the pair of proton with electron , @xmath28 - positron with electron and @xmath29 - positron with proton . we neglect spin - orbit interactions . in this case spacial and spin parts of the total three - body wavefunction separate . the latter can be ignored as it has no effect on scattering observables . the spacial part of the total three - body scattering wavefunction satisfies @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the full hamiltonian , @xmath32 is the three - free - particle hamiltonian , @xmath33 is the coulomb interaction between particles of pair @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) . the total hamiltonian can also be expressed in the following way @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the hamiltonian of the bound pair @xmath38 , @xmath39 is the momentum of free particle @xmath38 relative to c.m . of the bound pair , @xmath40 is the reduced mass of the two fragments and @xmath41 is the interaction potential of the free particle with the bound system in channel @xmath38 ( @xmath42 ) . coupled - channel methods are based on expansion of the total wavefunction @xmath43 in terms of functions of all asymptotic channels . however , since the asymptotic wavefunction corresponding to 3 free particles has a complicated form @xcite , this is not practical . therefore , we approximate @xmath43 by expansion over some negative and discrete positive energy pseudostates of pairs @xmath27 and @xmath28 especially chosen to best reproduce the corresponding physical states . suppose we have some @xmath44 pseudostates in pair @xmath27 and @xmath45 in pair @xmath28 satisfying the following conditions @xmath46 and @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a pseudostate wavefunction of pair @xmath38 and @xmath49 is the corresponding pseudostate energy . then we can write @xmath50 where @xmath51 is an unknown weight function , @xmath52 is the relative position of the particles in pair @xmath53 , @xmath54 is the position of particle @xmath53 relative to the centre of mass ( c.m . ) of pair @xmath53 ( @xmath55 ) , see fig . [ fig1jacobi ] . for convenience , here we use the same notation not only to denote a pair and a corresponding channel , but also a quantum state in this pair and the channel . so , the indices of functions @xmath56 and @xmath48 , additionally refer to a full set of quantum numbers of a state in the channel . in the case of vectors @xmath54 and @xmath52 , the indices still refer only to a channel and a pair in the channel , respectively .    in principle , at this formal stage one could keep the continuum part only for one of the pairs in order not to double up the treatment of the three - body breakup channel . however , a symmetric expansion of the type ( [ phi ] ) , with the continuum states on both centres , was found to give fastest convergence in calculations with a manageable number of states  @xcite .    ) , proton ( @xmath28 ) , and electron ( @xmath29).,width=321 ]    now we use the bubnov - galerkin principle  @xcite to find the coefficients @xmath51 so that the expansion ( [ phi ] ) satisfies eq . ( [ seh ] ) the best possible way . accordingly , we substitute the expansion ( [ phi ] ) into eq . ( [ seh ] ) and require the result to be orthogonal to all ( @xmath57 ) basis states , i.e. @xmath58 in this equation subscript @xmath59 indicates integration over all variables except @xmath59 . now taking into account conditions ( [ diag1 ] ) and ( [ diag2 ] ) we can write eq . ( [ ls1 ] ) in the following form : @xmath60 the potential operators @xmath61 are given by @xmath62 the condition imposed above in eq . ( [ ls2 ] ) is a system of coupled equations for unknown expansion coefficients @xmath63 . these functions carry information on the scattering amplitudes . we transform these integro - differential equations for the weight functions to a set of coupled lippmann - schwinger integral equations for transition amplitudes @xmath64 .    to this end we define the green s function in channel @xmath38 @xmath65 to describe the relative motion of free particle @xmath38 and bound pair @xmath38 with binding energy @xmath66 . we can now write the formal solution of the differential equation ( [ ls2 ] ) as @xmath67 the addition of positive @xmath68 defines the integration path around the singularity point at @xmath69^{1/2}$ ] , which is real for @xmath70 , and corresponds to the outgoing wave boundary conditions . taking eq . ( [ f - eq2 ] ) to the asymptotic region one can demonstrate @xcite that latexmath:[\ ] ] where @xmath223 , @xmath224 is the dipole polarizability and @xmath225 are adjustable parameters to fit some physical quantities ( e.g. , energies of the valence electron ) . mg is modelled as a he - like system with two active electrons above a frozen hartree - fock core @xcite . the interaction between an active electron and the frozen hartree - fock core is calculated as a sum of the static part of the hartree - fock potential and an exchange potential between an active and the core electrons as described in the previous subsection . details of the two - centre ccc method for positron - mg collisions are given in @xcite . wavefunctions for the inert gases of ne , ar , kr , and xe are described by a model of six p - electrons above a frozen hartree - fock core . discrete and continuum target states are obtained by allowing one - electron excitations from the p - shell in the following way . taking ne as an example , self - consistent hartree - fock calculations are performed for the ne@xmath2 ion , resulting in the 1s,2s,2p orbitals . the 1s and 2s orbitals are treated as the inert core orbitals , while the 2p hartree - fock orbital is used as the frozen - core orbital to form the target states . a set of laguerre functions is used to diagonalize the quasi - one - electron hamiltonian of the ne@xmath226 ion , utilising the nonlocal hartree - fock potential constructed from the inert core orbitals . the resulting 2p orbital differs substantially from the hartree - fock 2p orbital . a one - electron basis suitable for the description of a neutral ne atom is built by replacing the 2p orbital from diagonalisation with the hartree - fock one , orthogonalized by the gram - schmidt procedure . the six - electron target states are described via the configuration - interaction ( ci ) expansion . the set of configurations is built by angular momentum coupling of the wavefunction of 2p@xmath227 electrons and the laguerre - based one - electron functions . the coefficients of the ci expansion are obtained by diagonalization of the target hamiltonian . the target orbital angular momentum @xmath90 , spin @xmath6 , and parity @xmath228 are conserved quantum numbers and diagonalization of the target hamiltonian is performed separately for each target symmetry \{@xmath229}. full details of the single centre ccc calculations for noble gas atoms are given in ref . a two - centre approach to inert gases has not yet been attempted . positron - h@xmath0 scattering can be treated somewhat similar to the helium case . we consider h@xmath0 within the born - oppenheimer approximation where the two protons are considered to be at a fixed internuclear distance denoted as @xmath13 . expansion for the total scattering wavefunction ( after separation of the spin part ) is similar to eq . ( [ twfex7 ] ) for he . however , the wavefunctions for the target in the first term and the residual ion in the ps - formation channel depend on @xmath13 . the residual ion of h@xmath230 , with same internuclear distance @xmath13 , is considered to be only in its ground state . we only use a few ps eigenstates so as to take advantage of their analytical form . the target states are obtained by diagonalizing the h@xmath0 hamiltonian in a set of antisymmetrized two - electron configurations , built from laguerre one - electron orbitals , for each target symmetry characterized by the projection of orbital angular momentum , parity and spin . to calculate h@xmath0 states , we use the fixed - nuclei approximation . calculations are performed at the ground - state equilibrium internuclei distance taken to be @xmath13 = 1.4  a@xmath231 . when @xmath13 is set to 0 one should obtain the he results . we used this test for both structure and scattering calculations . details of h@xmath0 structure calculations can be found in @xcite . the derivation of the rearrangement matrix elements are somewhat more difficult than for he because of their dependence on the nuclear separation and target orientation . another difference is that partial wave expansion is done over the total angular momentum projection @xmath93 . it is convenient to choose the z - axis to be along the @xmath232 vector ( body - frame ) . then it is possible to transform the obtained results with this choice of z - axis to any given orientation of the molecule . to facilitate the calculations only the spherical part of the nuclear potential is considered when calculating the rearrangement matrix elements : @xmath233 where @xmath234 . then the momentum space representation of the above positron - nucleus potential can be shown to be @xmath235 with these one further follows the procedure used for positron - he calculations @xcite . for positron collisions with the ground state of h@xmath0 only states with zero total spin are required and so @xmath236 . @xmath237-matrix elements are used for obtaining body - frame scattering amplitudes . these are then rotated by euler angles to transform them to lab - frame scattering amplitudes . orientationally - independent cross sections are calculated by averaging over all rotations of the molecule @xcite . an orientationally averaged analytic born subtraction method @xcite is employed for h@xmath0 direct transition channels . this helped reduce the number of partial waves requiring explicit calculation . fundamentally , in order for a theory to be useful it needs to be predictive . in the close - coupling approach to electron / positron / proton scattering on relatively simple targets , where the structure is readily obtained , there are two computational problems that need to be overcome . the first , is that for a given set of states used to expand the total wavefunction the resulting equations need to be solved to an acceptable numerical precision . the second is to systematically increase the size of the expansion and demonstrate that the final results converge to a unique answer that is independent of the choice of the expansion , so long as it is sufficiently large . only once this is achieved can we be in a position to claim that the results are the true solution of the underlying schrdinger equation and hence predictive of what should happen in the experiment . in the case of electron scattering there are only one - centre expansions because electrons do not form bound states with the electrons of the target . electron exchange is handled within the potential matrix elements all based on the coordinate origin at the nucleus . accordingly , establishing convergence in just the one - centre approach is all that needs to be done , though historically this was a major challenge  @xcite . though convergence was shown to be to a result that disagreed with experiment  @xcite , subsequent experiments showed excellent agreement with the ccc theory  @xcite , which lead to reanalysis of the original data  @xcite yielding good agreement with the ccc theory and new experiments . a similar situation occurred in the case of double photoionisation of helium  @xcite , which in effect is electron scattering on the singly charged helium ion  @xcite .    for positron and proton scattering the issue of convergence is even more interesting due to the capacity of the projectile to form a bound state with a target electron . this leads to a second natural centre in the problem which also requires treatment to convergence . for positron scattering on atomic hydrogen the ps - formation threshold is at 6.8  ev , while the ionisation threshold is 13.6  ev . however , ps formation is also a form of ionisation of the target except that the electron is captured to a bound state of the projectile . any expansion of the ps centre using a complete basis will result in negative- and positive - energy states , with the latter corresponding to three - body breakup . however , expansion of the atomic centre will also generate independent positive - energy states corresponding to three - body breakup . hence , expansions using a complete basis on each centre , will yield independent , non - orthogonal states corresponding to the same physical three - body breakup process . while this may appear to be a fundamental problem , in practice it is an interesting strength of the method which allows to check internal consistency of the results . by this we mean that the same results must be obtained from a variety of calculations utilising independent one- and two - centre expansions as detailed below . we begin by considering two extremes : the first attempts to obtain convergence using only the atomic centre , while the second attempts convergence using two complete expansion on both centres . will either converge , and if they do , will the convergence be to the same result ?     and @xmath238 , arising upon diagonalisation of the respective hamiltonians , in the ccc(12@xmath239,12@xmath0 ) positron - hydrogen calculations . here @xmath240 states were obtained for each @xmath90 with @xmath241 for h states and @xmath242 for ps states , see kadyrov  _ et al . _  @xcite . [ energies ] ]     arising from one - centre ( left ) and two - centre ( right ) ccc positron - hydrogen calculations . @xmath243 is the number of h states in the one - centre calculation which has no explicit ps states . @xmath244 is the number of h states in the two - centre calculation with @xmath245 explicit ps states . first presented by bray  _ et al .  _ @xcite . ]    in fig . [ energies ] typical energies arising in two - centre calculations are given . we see a similar spread of negative- and positive - energy states on both the h and the ps centres . a single centre expansion based on the atomic centre would not have any ps states included in the calculation . the results of the two types of calculations may be readily summarised by fig . [ picture ] . on the left we have one - centre cross sections @xmath246 , where @xmath247 . taking the initial state to be the ground state of h ( @xmath248 ) then @xmath249 is the elastic scattering cross section , and @xmath250 corresponds to excitation whenever @xmath251 and ionisation whenever @xmath252 . the elastic and excitation cross sections need to converge with increasing @xmath243 individually . however , the ionisation cross sections converge as a sum , yielding the total ionisation cross section @xmath253 for @xmath254 . convergence of the one - centre ccc calculations , where there are no ps states , has been studied extensively  @xcite . briefly , at energies below the ps - formation threshold the important contribution of virtual ps formation is adequately treated via the positive - energy atomic states of large angular momentum @xmath255 . this allows for convergence of elastic scattering cross section to the correct value . at energies above the ionisation threshold , the positive - energy atomic pseudostates take into account both breakup and ps - formation cross section in a collective way yielding the correct electron - loss and excitation cross sections . however , in the extended ore gap region between the ps - formation and ionisation thresholds no convergence is possible due to all positive - energy pseudostates being closed . convergence in two - centre calculations is potentially problematic at all energies due to two independent treatments of the breakup processes . in practice this manifests itself as an ill - conditioned system which requires high - precision matrix elements and limits the size of the calculations i.e. @xmath256 and @xmath245 are typically substantially smaller than @xmath243 . it is for this reason that we have drawn the one - center matrix to be substantially larger in fig . [ picture ] . furthermore , the h - ps matrix elements take at least an order of magnitude longer to calculate due to the non - separable nature of the radial integrals  @xcite . accordingly , even with much smaller number of states ( with smaller @xmath257 ) the two - centre calculations take considerably longer to complete . nevertheless convergence is obtained for individual transitions involving discrete states , explicit ps formation , and explicit breakup  @xcite . internal consistency is satisfied if at energies outside the extended ore gap , for discrete ( @xmath258 ) atomic transitions the two approaches independently converge such that @xmath259 furthermore , at energies above the breakup threshold @xmath260 where for some initial state @xmath34 @xmath261 in the extended ore gap only the two - centre calculations are able to yield convergent results . the great strength of the internal - consistency check is that it is available ( outside the extended ore gap ) for every partial wave of the total orbital angular momentum . checking that eq . ( [ eloss ] ) is satisfied for every partial wave provides confidence in the overall results of the two completely independent calculations , which will typically have very different convergence properties with increasing @xmath8 and @xmath90 . due to the unitarity of the close - coupling theory agreement for eq . ( [ eloss ] ) suggests agreement for other channels , and so eq .  ( [ disc ] ) will also hold . obtained using the one- and two - centre ccc calculations , see text . the indicated points corresponding to the energies at which the calculations were performed are connected with straight lines to guide the eye . the vertical lines are the ps - formation and breakup thresholds , spanning the extended ore gap . the experimental data in the bottom left panel are due to @xcite . first presented by @xcite . [ p - h ] ]    in fig . [ p - h ] we give the example of an internal - consistency check , presented by @xcite . we see that outside the extended ore gap the two calculations are generally in very good agreement . one systematic exception is at just above the ionisation threshold . here the breakup cross section is almost zero , but the ps - formation cross section is near its maximum . even with @xmath262 the one - centre calculation does not have enough pseudostates of energy just a little above zero which would be necessary to reproduce the what should be step - function behaviour in one - centre ccc calculations . due to explicit ps - formation in the two - centre calculations there are no such problems here or within the extended ore gap . having checked the individual partial waves , and summing over all to convergence , excellent agreement is found with experiment . having performed the internal consistency checks we remain confident in the theoretical results even if there is potentially a discrepancy with experiment at the lowest energy measured .      establishing convergence in the cross sections with a systematically increasing close - coupling expansion places a severe test on the scattering formalism . this is as relevant to positron scattering as it is for electron scattering . pseudoresonances must disappear with increased size of the calculations , and uncertainty in the final results can be established via the convergence study . one of the earliest successes of the two - centre ccc method for positron - hydrogen @xmath171-wave scattering was to show how the higgins - burke pseudoresonance  @xcite disappeared utilising a ( @xmath18 ) basis of only @xmath6-states on each centre  @xcite . the cross sections for all reaction channels were shown to converge to a few  % with a ( @xmath263 ) basis of @xmath6-states . interestingly , the symmetric treatment of both centres was particularly efficient in terms of reaching convergence and eliminating pseudoresonances , with no double - counting problems . the question of convergence in the case of the full positron - hydrogen scattering problem was investigated by @xcite . setting @xmath264 , states of higher angular momentum were increased systematically . the same level of convergence as in the @xmath171-wave model case was achieved with the ( @xmath265 ) basis made of ten @xmath6- , nine @xmath12- , eight @xmath13- and seven @xmath266-states for each centre , for scattering on the ground state . the largest calculations performed had a total of 68 states , 34 each of h and ps states . the convergence was checked for the total and other main cross sections corresponding to transitions to negative - energy states . reasonably smooth cross sections were obtained for all bases with @xmath90-convergence being rather rapid . for the three cases considered @xmath266-states contribute only marginally . [ fig6]-[fig8 ] show the ccc results in comparison with other calculations and experimental data of detroit  @xcite and london  @xcite groups . the ccc results agree well with experiment . so do cc(@xmath17 ) calculations of @xcite and cc(@xmath16 ) calculations of @xcite . note that in these calculations the @xmath267 scaling rule was used to estimate the total ps formation . also , an energy - averaging procedure was used to smooth the cc(@xmath11 ) calculations of @xcite . in the ccc method convergence is established without such procedures being used .    for the breakup cross section the ccc results have two comparable contributions , one from the excitation of the positive - energy h pseudostates ( shown in fig . [ fig8 ] as direct ionization ) , and the other from excitation of positive - energy ps pseudostates . this was also noted by kernoghan et al . @xcite using the cc(@xmath11 ) calculations . by contrast , in cc(@xmath10)-type calculations the contribution to breakup comes only from from direct ionisation . at the maximum of the cross section the separately converged indirect contribution to the breakup cross section is approximately a third of the total . however , the cc(@xmath17 ) cross section of @xcite is only a marginally smaller , indicating that absence of ps positive - energy states is absorbed by the positive - energy h states . [ fig1prl ] shows the ccc results of fig . [ fig8 ] , but against excess ( total ) energy to emphasize the lower energies . the full ccc(h+ps ) results with breakup cross sections coming from both the h and ps centres are contrasted with those just from h and twice h ( labeled as ccc(h+h ) ) . we see that below about 20  ev excess energy the ccc(h+ps ) and ccc(h+h ) curves are much the same , indicating that the ps and h contributions to breakup converge to each other as the threshold is approached . h breakup cross section as a function of excess energy calculated using the two - center ccc method , first presented by @xcite . the argument to the ccc label indicates which center s positive - energy states were used , see text . the experiment is due to @xcite . ] utilising the ccc method @xcite reported calculations of positron - hydrogen scattering near the breakup threshold in order to examine the threshold law . the results are given in fig . [ fig2prl ] . the wannier - like threshold law , derived by @xcite , is in good agreement with the ccc results below 1  ev excess energy . this law was derived for the @xmath268 partial wave , and @xcite showed the same energy - dependence holds in all partial waves . as for the full problem the contributions from both centres to the breakup cross section converge to each other with decreasing excess energy , without any over - completeness problems . h @xmath171-wave model breakup cross section as a function of excess energy calculated using the two - center ccc method , from @xcite . as in fig . [ fig1prl ] , the argument to the ccc label indicates which center s positive - energy states were used . the wannier - like threshold law is due to @xcite ]    . [ fig2prl ]      helium in its ground state is the most frequently used target in experimental studies of positron - atom scattering . first measurements on positron - helium scattering were carried out by @xcite in 1972 . since then many other experimental studies have been conducted  @xcite . further developments of positron beams in terms of energy resolution and beam intensities have recently motivated more experimental studies  @xcite . in general , the results from the experiments agree well with each other . a complete theoretical approach from low to high energies had been lacking until the development of the ccc method for the problem by @xcite . a vast amount of experimental data is available for integrated cross sections for positron scattering from the helium ground state . the total ccc - calculated cross section is shown in fig . [ tcs - exp ] in comparison with experimental data and other calculations . considerable discussion on the topic has been presented by @xcite . it suffices to say that so long as an accurate ground state is used , obtained from a multi - core ( mc ) treatment , agreement with experiment is outstanding across all energies . we expect the frozen - core ( fc ) treatment of helium to result in systematically larger excitation and ionization cross sections because it understimate the ionization potential by around 0.84  ev . generally , a larger ionisation potential leads to a smaller cross section . in the ccc method we are not free to replace calculated energies with those from experiment , as this leads to numerical inconsistency . consequently , there is no way to avoid the extra complexity associated with the mc calculations if high accuracy is required . the total ps - formation , breakup and electron - loss cross sections are given in fig . [ fig3in1](a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) , respectively . beginning with ps formation , given the minor variation in the measurements agreement between the various theories and experiment is satisfactory . however , turning our attention to the breakup cross section we see that ( mc ) ccc appears to be substantially higher than experiment . yet when these cross sections are summed to form the electron - loss cross section , the agreement with the experiment of @xcite which measured this directly , is good . given the complexity of the problem and the experimental uncertainties , the agreement with experiment is very satisfying . s ) and ( b ) he(2@xmath22p ) excitations by positron impact . experiment is due to @xcite . the fc ccc and mc ccc results are from @xcite , other calculations are due to @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . ]    the cross sections of 2@xmath22s and 2@xmath22p excitation of helium are presented in fig . [ figex]a and b , respectively . the mc ccc result for @xmath269s is in good agreement with the data of @xcite while the @xmath269p result is somewhat lower than experiment . the fact that the fc ccc @xmath269p results agree better with the experimental data is fortuitous . other available theories show some systematic difficulties for these relatively small cross sections . the cross sections for the rather exotic ps formation in the 2@xmath6 and 2@xmath12 excited states are presented in fig . [ figpsex](a ) and ( b ) respectively . the cross sections are particularly small . nevertheless , agreement with the sole available experiment of @xcite is remarkable .     and ( b ) 2@xmath12 states . experimental data for ps(2@xmath12 ) are due to @xcite . the fc ccc and mc ccc results are from @xcite and other calculations are due to @xcite and @xcite . ] thus we have seen that there is good agreement between theory and experiment for the integrated cross sections for positron scattering on helium and hydrogen in their ground states . in both cases the ionisation thresholds are well above 6.8  ev , and so a one - centre calculation is applicable at low energies where elastic scattering is the only open channel . though experimentally challenging positron scattering on either h or he metastable excited states results in ps formation being an open channel at all energies . taking the example of positron scattering from the @xmath270s metastable state of helium the ps threshold is negative ( -2.06 ev ) . this collision system has been extensively studied by @xcite . as far as we are aware , no experimental studies have been conducted for positron scattering on metastable states of helium . given the experimental work on electron scattering from metastable helium @xcite , in a group that also has a positron beam , we are hopeful that in the future there might be experimental data available for such systems . as there are still unresolved discrepancies between theory and experiment regarding electron scattering from metastable states of he @xcite , using positrons instead of electrons may assist with their resolution . just like for h and he in metastable states , for positron collisions with alkali - metal atoms in their ground state , both elastic and ps(1s ) formation channels are open even at zero positron energy accordingly , we require two - centre expansions even at the lowest incident energies . @xcite conducted two - centre calculations with different basis sets to achieve results that are independent of the laguerre exponential fall - off parameter @xmath271 , and convergent with the laguerre basis size @xmath272 for target orbital angular momentum @xmath273 . -li along with the experimental points by @xcite and theoretical calculations by @xcite . the truncated basis ( ccc tr ) calculation is an attempt to reproduce the states used by @xcite , see @xcite for details . [ fig:4li ] ]    figure  [ fig:4li ] shows the positronium - formation cross section . agreement between the various calculations is quite good , while comparison with the experimental data of @xcite is rather mixed . the key feature is that the ps - formation cross section diminishes with decreasing energy , supported by all theories , and consistent with experiment . overall , it appears there is no major reason to be concerned . unfortunately , changing the target to sodium , substantial discrepancies between theory and experiment arise , and remain unresolved to date . one of the motivations for extending the ccc theory to two - centre calculations of positron - alkali scattering was to address this problem . @xcite performed the most extensive study of this problem that included one- and two - centre calculations . despite establishing convergence and consistency of the two approaches no improvement on previous calculations was found . -na scattering . experiment is due to @xcite , and the calculations due to @xcite and @xcite . [ fig:4na ] ]    we begin by considering the total cross section for positron - sodium scattering , presented in fig .  [ fig:2na ] . we see good agreement between various two - centre calculations , with the one - centre ccc(217,0 ) calculation behaving as expected : agreeing with ccc(116,14 ) only above the ionisation threshold , and not being valid ( or even convergent ) below the ionisation threshold . all of the two - centre calculations are considerably above the experiment at low energies . curiously , the situation is reversed for the total ps - formation component of the total cross section , presented in fig . [ fig:4na ] , where now all of the theories are considerably below the experiment . given that the total cross section at the lowest energies considered is the sum of elastic and ps - formation cross sections , the presented discrepancies with experiment imply that the theoretical elastic scattering cross sections are overwhelmingly high  @xcite . why this would be the case remains a mystery . ( lower panel ) and scaled ps - formation @xmath274 ( upper panel ) cross sections for positron - lithium scattering , as a function of energy ( 13.6@xmath275 ) , for the zeroth partial wave calculated with the indicated ccc(@xmath276 ) laguerre basis parameters , as presented by @xcite . [ li ] ]    faced with the problems identified above , @xcite considered threshold behaviour in positron scattering on alkali atoms . following @xcite we expect exothermic reactions such as ps formation in positron - alkali scattering to result in a cross section that tends to infinity as @xmath277 as the positron energy ( @xmath275 ) goes to zero . this is not yet evident in fig . [ fig:4li ] or fig . [ fig:4na ] for the considered energies . nevertheless , @xcite did obtain the required analytical behaviour , but only in the zeroth partial wave . in fig . [ li ] the ps - formation cross section is presented for the zeroth partial wave multiplied by @xmath278 so as to demonstrate the expected threshold behaviour . the convergence study of @xcite is also presented , where the effect of adding the ps(@xmath279 ) state was able to be reproduced by atomic pseudostates of high orbital angular momentum . @xcite found that higher partial waves @xmath79 become major contributors to ps formation at energies above @xmath280  ev , and have a threshold behaviour as @xmath281 , and so rise rapidly with increasing energies . it is the contributions of the higher partial waves that is responsible for the behaviour in the ps - formation cross section seen in fig . [ fig:4li ] . but for positron - sodium scattering . [ na ] ]    we find the same is the case for positron - sodium scattering . in fig . [ na ] we present @xmath282 and @xmath283 for the zeroth partial wave , demonstrating the expected threshold behaviour . details of the convergence study are discussed by @xcite . it suffices to say that there is a range of combinations of atomic and ps states that should yield convergent results , with such studies being considerably easier at the lower energies where there are only two open channels . as in the case of lithium the zeroth partial wave is dominant only below @xmath280  ev , with the results presented in fig . [ fig:4na ] being dominated by the higher partial waves . but for positron - potassium scattering . [ k ] ]    lastly , having been unable to explain the discrepancy between experiment and theory for positron - sodium scattering @xcite also considered the positron - potassium scattering system . however , much the same behaviour as for the lighter alkalis was found , see fig . consequently , the discrepancy between experiment and theory for low - energy positron scattering on sodium remains unresolved . one interesting aspect of the presented elastic cross sections for positron scattering on the alkalis are the minima . in the case of li and na they are at just above 0.001  ev , whereas for k the minimum is at around 0.04  ev . given that in all cases we have just two channels open , elastic and ps formation , we have no ready explanation for the minima , or their positions . the generally smaller ps - formation cross section shows no structure in the same energy region , which is surprising given the substantial minima in the elastic cross section . for experimentalists the transition from say sodium to magnesium for the purpose of positron scattering is relatively straightforward , not so in the case of theory . two valence electrons on top of a hartree - fock core makes for a very complicated projectile - target combination to treat computationally . however , with an ionization energy of 7.6  ev the single - centre approach is valid below 0.8  ev allowing for a test of the two - centre method in this energy region . this is an important test because in the single centre approach there are no approximations associated with explicit ps formation , and the core is fully treated by the hartree - fock approach rather than an equivalent local core potential approximation . one - centre positron - magnesium ccc calculations were presented by @xcite , and two - centre ones by @xcite . the results confirmed the existence of a low - energy shape - resonance predicted earlier by @xcite . the results are presented in fig . [ figure3 mg ] . given that the resonance is at a very low energy and that a slight energy difference in the target structure may affect its position the agreement between the theories is very encouraging . as explained in sec . [ intcont ] , one - centre calculations are unable to yield convergent results within the extended ore gap ( presently between 0.8  ev and 7.6  ev ) . the unphysical structures displayed within this energy region in the calculations of @xcite depend on the choice of basis with just one example presented . unfortunately , the agreement with the experiment of @xcite for the total cross section has the unexpected feature of being good above the ionisation threshold and poor below , see fig . [ figure4 mg ] . given that the validity of the two - centre ccc approach should be energy independent we are unable to explain the discrepancy . -mg elastic - scattering cross section.the first vertical line is at the ps - formation threshold , the second one is at the mg - ionization threshold . the ( two - centre ) ccc calculations are due to @xcite , the one - centre due to @xcite , and the variational ones due to @xcite . [ figure3 mg ] ]    -mg total scattering cross section . the vertical line indicates the mg - ionization threshold . experimental data are due to @xcite , and the calculations are as for fig . [ figure3 mg ] . ]    the ps - formation cross section is presented in fig . [ figure5 mg ] , where there are large experimental uncertainties . the experimental data of @xcite are preliminary estimations for the upper and the lower limits of the ps - formation cross section . the ( two - centre ) ccc results are compared with the previous calculations . while there is substantial variation the theories tend to favour the upper limit estimates . -mg ps - formation cross section . experimental data for upper and lower limits of the ps - formation cross section are due to @xcite . the vertical line indicates the position of the ps - formation threshold . the calculations are due to @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , walters ( data taken from ref . @xcite ) and @xcite . [ figure5 mg ] ]    positron scattering on inert - gas atoms has been studied using the single - centre ccc method  @xcite . as discussed in the introduction the complexity of adding the second ( ps ) centre is immense , and has not yet been attempted within a convergent close - coupling formalism . the large ionisation thresholds mean that the single centre calculations are valid for elastic scattering on the substantial energy range below the ps - formation threshold , as well as above the ionisation threshold , but no explicit ps - formation cross section may be determined . this is particularly unfortunute in light of the intriguing cusp - like behaviour observed by @xcite across the ps - formation threshold . due to the small magnitude of the structures a highly accurate theoretical treatment is required , but does not yet exist . the experimental and theoretical situation for positron - noble gas collision systems has been recently reviewed extensively by @xcite . if we allow the internuclear separation of the two protons in h@xmath0 to be fixed then the extra complexity , relative to the helium atom , is somewhat manageable . various cross sections for @xmath284 scattering have been recently calculated by @xcite using the two - center ccc method . this represents the most complex implementation of the two - centre formalism to date . issues regarding convergence with laguerre - based molecular and ps states have been discussed in some detail . calculations with only up to three ps(@xmath184 ) , ps(@xmath279 ) and ps(@xmath285 ) states on the ps centre were presented above 10  ev . at lower energies the current implementation of the two - centre formalism fails to pass the internal consistency check with the single - center calculations of @xcite . the low energies are particularly sensitive to the approximations of the treatment of the ( virtual ) ps formation in the field of the highly structured h@xmath24 ion . here we just present the key two - centre results in comparison of experiment and theory . experimental data are due to @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . the single centre ccc(@xmath286 ) results are due to @xcite . the two - centre ccc calculations are due to @xcite . [ figure3h2 ] ]    in fig . [ figure3h2 ] the theoretical results are compared with the available experimental data for the grand total cross section . good agreement between the two- and one - centre calculation above the ionisation threshold is very satisfying , even if in this energy region the theory is somewhat below experiment . good agreement with experiment of the two - centre ccc results below the ionisation threshold , dominated by the elastic and ps - formation cross sections , is particularly pleasing . [ figure4h2 ] shows the ps - formation cross section which is a substantial component of the gtcs , particularly near its maximum around 20  ev . there is a little variation between the three ccc calculations particularly at the lower energies , with the largest ccc calculation being uniformly a little lower than experiment . h@xmath0 collisions . experimental data are due to @xcite ( shaded region incorporates upper and lower limits with their uncertainties ) , @xcite and @xcite . coupled static model calculations are due to @xcite . the ccc calculations are due to @xcite . [ figure4h2 ] ]    h@xmath0 collisions . experimental data are due to @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . the ccc calculations are due to @xcite . [ figure5h2 ] ]    h@xmath0 collisions . experimental data are due to @xcite and @xcite . the ccc calculations are due to @xcite ( one - centre ) and @xcite ( two - centre ) . [ figure6h2 ] ]    in fig . [ figure5h2 ] the ccc results for the direct total ionization cross section ( tics ) are compared with the available experimental data . the experimental data of @xcite and @xcite are in agreement with each other but differ from measurements of @xcite between 30 and 100  ev . the largest ccc calculation ccc(14@xmath0,3 ) , which contains @xmath6- , @xmath12- and @xmath13-atomic orbitals together with the three lowest - energy ps states , is in better agreement with the measurements of @xcite . the ccc(14@xmath287,1 ) and ccc(14@xmath287,3 ) are systematically lower , primarily due to the absence of the @xmath13-atomic orbitals . due to the unitarity of the close - coupling formalism , larger @xmath90-orbitals are likely to only marginally increase the tics . once we have convergence in the elastic scattering ( large @xmath90-orbitals not required ) the gtcs is set , with the distribution between elastic , electron - excitation , ps - formation and total ionisation cross sections thereby being constrained  @xcite . finally , the total electron - loss cross section is given in fig . [ figure6h2 ] , and is the sum of tics and ps - formation cross sections . it is useful because the one - centre ccc approach is able to yield this cross section at energies above the ionisation threshold . this provides for an important internal - consistency check . we see that around 50  ev the largest two - centre ccc calculation is somewhat lower than the one - centre calculation . given the increase in the cross section due to the inclusion of @xmath13-orbitals adding @xmath266-orbitals would go someway to reduce the discrepancy . increasing the laguerre basis @xmath288 in the one - centre calculations would increase the cross section just above the ionisation threshold due to an improving discretisation of the continuum .    despite the immense complexity of the positron - molecular - hydrogen scattering problem considerable progress in obtaining reasonably accurate cross sections has been made . as stated earlier , via eq . ( [ antihform ] ) , antihydrogen formation is effectively the time - reverse process of ps formation upon positron - hydrogen scattering . accordingly , it only takes place at positron energies above the ps(@xmath5 ) formation threshold , where @xmath5 indicates the principal quantum number . furthermore , we require two - centre calculations because only these have explicit ps and h states . given that we are interested in as large cross sections as possible , and that the exothermic transition cross sections go to infinity at threshold  @xcite the primary energy range of interest is within the extended ore gap , as given in fig . [ p - h ] .    , scattering on ( anti)protons calculated using the ccc method , first presented by @xcite . for ps(1s ) , the variational calculations @xcite are for ( anti)hydrogen formation in the 1s state only ( ccc - calculated unconnected points presented for comparison ) , while the uba calculations of @xcite and @xcite , and the ccc calculations generally , are for ( anti)hydrogen formation in all open states . the three experimental points are due to @xcite . ] there are few calculations of antihydrogen formation that are accurate at low energies . as far as we are aware , apart from the ccc method  @xcite , only the variational approach of @xcite has yielded accurate results . the unitarised born approximation ( uba ) calculations  @xcite are not appropriate at low energies , and neither are first order approximations  @xcite .    large cross sections for antihydrogen formation occur for transitions between excited states of ps and h. to have these states accurate the laguerre bases @xmath289 for both h and ps need to be sufficiently large . @xcite used @xmath290 , with the resultant energies given in fig . [ energies ] . while it is trivial to have larger @xmath289 as far as the structure is concerned , the primary limiting factor is to be able to solve the resultant close - coupling equations . in fig . [ energies ] the positive energies correspond to the breakup of h and also of ps , and yet the two represent the same physical process . this leads to highly ill - conditioned equations . @xcite considered non - symmetric treatments of the two centres by dropping the ps positive - energy states . while these also satisfy internal - consistency checks they have not proved to be more efficient in yielding convergence , with increasing @xmath289 , in the cross sections of present interest .      a comprehensive set of antihydrogen formation cross sections for low - energy ps incident on an antiproton has been given by @xcite . they used the original numerical treatment of the green s function in eq . ( [ lskmat ] ) . in fig . [ p - ps ] , we present the summary of the total antihydrogen formation cross sections for specified initial ps(@xmath291 ) as presented by @xcite . excellent agreement with the variational calculations  @xcite , available only for the ground states of h and ps , gives us confidence in the rest of the presented ccc results . as predicted by @xcite the ground state cross section goes to infinity as @xmath292 at threshold , whereas for excited states this is modified to @xmath293 at threshold due to the long - range dipole interaction of degenerate ps @xmath294 states , as explained by @xcite . the cross sections increase steadily with increasing principle quantum number of ps , with the transition to the highest available principal quantum number of h being the most dominant contribution  @xcite . consequently there is considerable motivation to push the calculations even further to larger @xmath289 . there is a second source of ill - conditioning of the close - coupling equations to that discussed previously . given that we are particularly interested in low energies i.e. , just above the various thresholds , the singularity in the green s function of eq . ( [ lskmat ] ) occurs very close to zero energy . a typically used symmetric treatment on either side of the singularity results in very large positive and negative values which contribute to the ill - conditioning via precision loss .    ) formation cross sections for @xmath295 in p - ps(@xmath296 ) scattering for the zeroth partial wave . the `` old '' results arise from solving the original ccc equations  ( [ lskmat ] ) . the `` new '' results are due to the solution with the green s function being treated analytically , see @xcite . ] very recently @xcite showed that the green s function of the coupled lippmann - schwinger equations  ( [ lskmat ] ) can be treated analytically . the method that was previously used in calculating the optical potential in the coupled - channel optical method  @xcite was applied directly to the green s function in the lippmann - schwinger equation ( [ lskmat ] ) . in doing so , they showed that they could improve on the above @xmath290 basis to reach @xmath297 , and thereby consider transitions from ps(@xmath298 ) states . in fig . [ new ] we compare the `` old '' and the `` new '' numerical formulations and find that the latter is quite superior . in fact , for @xmath297 @xcite were unable to obtain numerical stability in the original formulation with variation of integration parameters over the momentum in eq . ( [ lskmat ] ) , and presented just a combination that yielded somewhat reasonable agreement with the results of the `` new '' numerical method . the new technique also proved to be particularly advantageous in studying threshold phenomena in positronium-(anti)proton scattering  @xcite . we have presented an overview of recent developments in positron - scattering theory on several atoms and molecular hydrogen , with particular emphasis on two - centre calculations that are able to explicitly treat positronium formation . while considerable progress has been made there remain some major discrepancies between theory and experiment such as for low - energy positron - sodium scattering . considerable technical development is still required for complicated atoms such as the heavier inert gases to incorporate ps formation in a systematically convergent way . a general scheme for doing so for molecular targets is also required . it is also important to state that there are still fundamental issues to be addressed in the case of breakup . while no overcompleteness has been found in two - centre calculations with near - complete bases on both centres , determining the resulting differential cross sections remains an unsolved problem . @xcite considered the simplest energy - differential cross section which describes the probablity of an electron of a certain energy being ejected . if we have contributions to this process from both centres , how do we combine them ? furthermore , diagonalising the ps hamiltonian yields pseudostates of positive - energy ps rather than the energy of the individual electron or positron . it may be that the only practical way to obtain differential ionisation cross sections is to restrict the ps centre to just negative - energy eigenstates , and obtain differential cross sections solely from the atomic centre positive - energy pseudostates , as is done for electron - impact ionisation  @xcite . however , this kind of approach may not be capable of describing the phenomenon of ps formation in continuum as seen by @xcite . this is currently under investigation . support of the australian research council and the

"one of the simplest ways to model the proton is as three very light quarks confined in a spherical well . choosing the radius of the well to be @xmath0 fm leads to moderately good agreement with experiment for its electromagnetic properties , such as the charge radius , magnetic moment , and static electric and magnetic polarizabilities . this model , a simplified version of the mit bag model @xcite , will be referred to in the following as the static - well model . it allows an alternative approach to the calculation of the electromagnetic properties of the proton , generally treated with methods quite different in character , that uses the methods of conventional bound - state qed . the latter theory is characterized by wave functions that satisfy the dirac equation in an external field along with electron propagators defined in terms of the same field . when the external field is that of a point coulomb source , a modification of the interaction representation introduced by furry @xcite allows a systematic feynman diagram treatment of radiative corrections . this approach can also be applied to many - electron systems , and a feynman diagram treatment of electron - electron interactions is also possible . as will be explained below , the present paper is patterned on a calculation of these interactions in heliumlike ions involving two - photon exchange @xcite . the approach we will use in this paper was applied some time ago @xcite to the computation of the electromagnetic self energy of the proton and neutron . in that work , both the effect of exchange of a photon between quarks along with the electromagnetic self energy of the quarks were evaluated and found to sum to @xmath1 mev for the proton and @xmath2 mev for the neutron for the case of nearly zero - mass quarks . the fact that the proton is lighter than the neutron remains explained by the fact that the down quark is heavier than the up quark , but it is of note that the electromagnetic correction to the mass splitting , @xmath3 mev , is the same order - of - magnitude as the neutron - proton mass difference , @xmath0 mev . the proton can be studied with electron - scattering experiments , which have a long history of providing information about its properties , in particular the root - mean - square ( rms ) radius , @xmath4 . the proton size has recently received considerable attention because of unexpected results for the @xmath5 transition energy of muonic hydrogen @xcite . the issue of determining @xmath4 from scattering data can be problematic , as extrapolating the slope of the dirac form factor to @xmath6 involves a number of assumptions @xcite . an alternative approach is to determine the proton size by doing precise measurements of atomic transitions that are sensitive to the effect of the size . the 2010 codata result @xcite in fact uses this procedure with hydrogen and deuterium , where the experiment and theory are so accurate that the proton size can be inferred with an accuracy comparable to that available from scattering experiments as of 2010 .    because of its smaller size , muonic hydrogen has long been recognized as a system whose spectrum could be used to determine a much more accurate rms radius of the proton than that obtained from hydrogen and deuterium , but the associated experimental obstacles have only recently been overcome . while indeed much more accurate , the result of ref . @xcite for the proton size , @xmath7 is significantly smaller than the codata result , @xmath8 this discrepancy is referred to as the muonic hydrogen puzzle .    one possible explanation of the puzzle involves the electromagnetic structure of the proton , and the largest theoretical uncertainty comes from an effect called proton polarizability . this is generally evaluated by relating the energy shift to forward virtual photon - proton scattering . the amplitude describing this scattering , @xmath9 , can then be related to proton form factors through dispersion relations . a recent paper that covers all contributions to muonic hydrogen with particular attention to proton polarizability is ref . @xcite ; in the conclusion , we compare our results to results quoted in that paper . a number of issues involving convergence of the dispersion theory integrals and the need for experimental data complicate that approach . the purpose of the present paper is to provide an alternative analysis patterned after bound - state field theory calculations in atomic physics . this will be done by using the static - well model of the proton together with standard bound - state qed . as we will show , there is a natural way of setting up a consistent qed calculation for hydrogen and muonic hydrogen , with the proton treated as a bound state of three quarks interacting with an electron or a muon , that requires no scattering information for its predictions ; rather it depends only on the radius of the well . regarding the proton as three relativistic particles confined to a small volume is closely analogous to treating three electrons in highly - charged ions , where the electrons for large nuclear charge @xmath10 are quite relativistic and the ion has a size of @xmath11 bohr radius . this problem has recently been addressed with techniques similar to those used for heliumlike ions mentioned above @xcite , and have been shown to provide an accurate description of these ions @xcite , the spectra of which have been measured with high accuracy @xcite .    in these calculations almost all of the important physics is described by feynman diagrams with one or two photons . the same turns out to hold for the present calculation , though in this paper , while we will show all relevant diagrams , we concentrate our attention on two effects dependent on proton structure , the polarizability of the proton and the screening of the proton electromagnetic self energy . our model of the proton is extremely simple , but there are three reasons we have chosen it . the first is that proton structure effects are generally very small , with even the largest , the effect of its finite size , accounting for about 2 percent of the transition energy in muonic hydrogen . thus even a crude determination of a proton structure effect will have a small relative theoretical error . the second is that while the proton polarizability correction has been evaluated with other methods , a contribution we term the proton lamb shift has not , and the results presented here may stimulate more sophisticated calculations . the final reason is that mentioned above , to explore a method of calculating the effect of proton structure on atomic energy levels that does not require the use of dispersion theory . we will in the following consider the effect of proton structure on both electronic and muonic hydrogen . because our formalism does not include recoil , we will present results in terms of the electron mass @xmath12 and the muon mass @xmath13 even though reduced - mass effects on the latter are about 10 percent . when we give a general formula , we refer to a lepton with mass @xmath14 . the state of the lepton , in practice either @xmath15 or @xmath16 , will be denoted @xmath17 , and the index @xmath18 will be used for sums over intermediate leptonic states : for the corresponding case of quarks , we use @xmath19 to denote a ground - state quark and reserve @xmath20 for sums over intermediate quark states . the plan of the paper is as follows . we begin in section ii with a quantum mechanical ( qm ) treatment of the shift in energy levels arising from the perturbation of replacing the potential of a point proton coulomb field with that of a general distribution of charge @xmath21 . this perturbation theory is evaluated through second order . in section iii we turn to a quantum - field - theoretic approach to the problem in the context of the static - well model . we do this by modifying the standard furry representation @xcite through forcing the lowest - order hamiltonian to be same as that used in that representation , but having the quarks in the proton provide the coulomb field instead of assuming a point source . this requires the introduction of a new term in the interaction hamiltonian we call the counter term , the effects of which however are quite simple to evaluate . we also define the static - well model and briefly review the calculation of the proton electromagnetic self energy . in section iv we use bound - state field theory to treat one photon exchange , and show that the results agree with the first order qm energy . we note here that in this paper we use the coulomb gauge and treat only coulomb photons for all exchanged photons . for the qm approach this corresponds to ignoring magnetic effects , and in field theory to leaving out transverse - photon exchange . in section v we then turn to two - photon exchange diagrams , which we break into two classes , one in which only one photon attaches to the lepton , with the other being emitted and reabsorbed in the proton , and a second in which each photon is exchanged between the lepton and a quark . in section va we treat the first class , which has no qm analog , and present a calculation of the contribution , which we call the proton lamb shift . in section vb we treat the second class , but again make a breakup of the diagrams into firstly a part in which the proton is left unchanged , and secondly a part where it is excited . ( in our model this means that in the spectral representation of the quark propagator it is either saturated with the @xmath22 state , or else that state is excluded ) . the first part will be shown to correspond exactly to the second - order qm energy . the second part , the proton polarizability , is then evaluated . the related calculation of the proton s static electric polarizability is carried out in section vi , and it is shown that in the @xmath23 angular momentum channel a complete cancellation between positive- and negative - energy state terms occurs , leaving only contributions from the @xmath24 intermediate states . in the conclusion we compare our results to the results of other calculations and describe directions for future progress . we consider a central potential for hydrogen or muonic hydrogen coming from a finite charge distribution @xmath25 , normalized to unity . the corresponding static potential is @xmath26 while we have @xmath27 , the following discussion can also be applied to the case @xmath28 . we start with a point - coulomb binding field , so this distribution leads to the perturbation @xmath29    the first - order correction , @xmath30 is valid for either a relativistic or nonrelativistic calculation . we first consider the nonrelativistic limit . then in leading order the wave functions may be replaced by their value at the origin and the first - order energy is @xmath31&= & - z\alpha \ ,     4\pi\left(\frac{1}{u^2 } - \frac{1}{6}\,\bm x^{\prime 2 } + \dots\right ) \left[\rho(\bm x^\prime ) - \delta(\bm x^\prime)\right ] \nonumber\\[10 pt]&= &   \frac{2\pi z\alpha}{3 } \ ,    \bm x^{2 } \rho(\bm x ) = \frac{2(z\alpha)^4}{3n^3}\,m_l^3 \int\rd \bm x \ , \bm x^{2 } \rho(\bm x ) , \label{rms1}\end{aligned}\ ] ] where in the last step we have assumed @xmath17 to be an @xmath32-state . the integral over @xmath33 has been carried out using a cutoff procedure which we now describe . we introduce a parameter @xmath34 , understood to ultimately be taken to zero , and work with the basic identity @xmath35 which for small @xmath34 has the expansion @xmath36 by differentiating once or twice with respect to @xmath34 , we have @xmath37 and @xmath38    we have used eq . ( [ eq : rint1 ] ) in the derivation of eq . ( [ rms1 ] ) , and use eq . ( [ eq : rint2 ] ) to evaluate the correction coming from the variation of the wave function to leading order . for s states , this arises from @xmath39 which yields an additional contribution of @xmath40&= & 2 ( z\alpha)^2 m_l\ ,     4\pi\left(\frac{2}{u^3 } - \frac{1}{12}\,|\bm x^\prime|^3 + \dots\right ) \left[\rho(\bm x^\prime ) - \delta(\bm x^\prime)\right ] \nonumber\\[10 pt]&= & - \frac{2\pi ( z\alpha)^2}{3 } \ , m_l \ ,     = -\frac{2(z\alpha)^5}{3n^3}\,m_l^4 \int\rd \bm x \ , \bm x^{3 } \rho(\bm x ) . \label{rms2}\end{aligned}\ ] ] this term cancels a corresponding term in second - order perturbation theory , which is given by the standard form @xmath41 the sum over terms involving @xmath18 is @xmath42 times the reduced green function . this expression is again valid for either a relativistic or nonrelativistic calculation . the correction to the potential is only non - zero outside the nucleus , which means that the wave functions and reduced green function are evaluated for small arguments , because the bohr radius for both the muon and electron is large compared to the nuclear size . we again take the nonrelativistic limit . then the wave functions may be evaluated at the origin and the reduced green function may be replaced by the nonrelativistic free green function to give @xmath43 & = & - \frac{(z\alpha)^2m_l}{2\pi}\,|\phi_v(0)|^2 \int\rd\bm x_2^\prime \int\rd\bm x_1^\prime \ , \nonumber\\[10 pt]&&\times \int\rd\bm x_2 \int\rd\bm x_1\ , \frac{\rho(\bm x_2^\prime)-\delta(\bm x_2^\prime ) } { |\bm x_2 - \bm x_2^\prime| } \ , \frac{1}{|\bm x_2 - \bm x_1| } \ , \frac{\rho(\bm x_1^\prime)-\delta(\bm x_1^\prime ) } { |\bm x_1 - \bm x_1^\prime| } \,.\end{aligned}\ ] ] introducing cutoffs allows us to carry out the integrals over the unprimed variables with the formulas given above , resulting in @xmath44&&\times   \int\rd\bm x_1\ , \left[\rho(\bm x_2^\prime)-\delta(\bm x_2^\prime)\right ]    \frac{\rho(\bm x_1^\prime)-\delta(\bm x_1^\prime ) } { |\bm x_1 - \bm x_1^\prime| } \,,\end{aligned}\ ] ] which yields @xmath45 \qquad \nonumber \\   & = &   - \frac{(z\alpha)^5}{3 n^3}\,m_l^4 \bigg [ \int\rd\bm x_2 \int\rd\bm x_1 \ , \rho(\bm x_2 )    \rho(\bm x_1 )    -2 \int\rd\bm x \ ,    \rho(\bm x ) \bigg ] . \qquad\label{eq : sopt}\end{aligned}\ ] ] as alluded to above , the second term in the square brackets in eq . ( [ eq : sopt ] ) is cancelled by eq . ( [ rms2 ] ) . the first term in the square brackets is the third zemach moment , which we denote @xmath46 . an interesting feature about this term is that it too is cancelled by a term that arises when the nucleus is allowed to undergo low - energy excitations ( proton polarizability ) , though we will not use this fact directly , and instead just evaluate the entire effect . we turn now to a field - theoretic approach based on the static - well model , and begin by introducing a formalism for bound - state field theory . while the formalism we use here is to our knowledge novel , it is a simple extension of the furry representation @xcite , which we now briefly review . we will use this representation both for leptons and quarks , and begin by describing how it is used for the former . the full qed hamiltonian used for describing the scattering of free leptons is @xmath47 , with ( @xmath48 ) , @xmath49   \psi(x)\ ] ] and @xmath50 with @xmath51 . we suppress normal ordering and the self - mass counter term for simplicity . the furry representation is used when @xmath52 is replaced by @xmath53 \psi(x).\ ] ] this builds in a classical coulomb field from an infinite mass proton . carrying out a unitary transformation to eliminate @xmath54 rather than @xmath52 leads to the furry representation in place of the interaction representation . while the interaction hamiltonian @xmath55 of a lepton with photons keeps the same form , the lowest order spectrum now consists of hydrogenic bound and scattering states , and the lepton green function obeys the relation @xmath56 which has the spectral representation @xmath57 in the present case we treat proton structure using the static - well model to specify the wave functions and green functions of the constituent quarks . however , the influence of the proton on a lepton in a bound state can not be treated perturbatively , so we need to build the binding of the lepton into the formalism nonperturbatively . we do this by modifying the breakup of the hamiltonian given above to @xmath58 . if we choose @xmath59 then this breakup is @xmath60 . in the following we refer to @xmath61 as the counter term , though of course it is to be distinguished from the electron mass counter term . we stress that we do _ not _ assume that a classical coulomb field is present . however , because we have added a new term to the interaction hamiltonian , @xmath54 is unchanged from the usual furry representation , and the same wave functions and green functions used in feynman diagram calculations in that representation can be used , although extra feynman diagrams involving @xmath61 need to be included . the use of the furry representation must be extended to quarks in order to account for the proton s coulomb field . in this case @xmath52 and @xmath55 are almost identical to the free case , but in @xmath52 we assume the presence of a static well that confines the quarks , the details of which are given below , so that the up and down quark fields are expanded in terms of solutions to the dirac equation in this well . the proton then consists of the usual two up quarks and one down quark , and the sum of their charges leads to the coulomb field felt by the lepton . since the lowest - order problem describes the basic physics of the atom , there has to be cancellation between diagrams in which a coulomb photon is exchanged between the lepton and the quarks in the proton and diagrams with one counter term . in second order another cancellation between two - photon exchange diagrams and diagrams involving one and two counter terms must take place , and so on . because the proton is now modeled as a finite object , the cancellation will not be complete , and we will identify the parts remaining after the near cancellation as the subject of this paper , proton structure effects . it is of course vital for this procedure to make sense that the cancellation not only takes place , but that the perturbation expansion converges . we will present results for the first and second terms in the expansion below . in determining the order of the expansion we note that the counter term @xmath61 is of the same order as two @xmath55 s . the static - well model has well - known solutions which we show partly to establish notation . we represent the solution to the free dirac equation in a spherically symmetric well , centered at the same origin as used in furry representation , by @xmath62 here @xmath63 is a spherical spinor and the radial wavefunctions obey the equations @xmath64f_2(r ) & = & 0 \\ \left({\partial \over \partial r }   + { 1 - \kappa \over r } \right)f_2(r )   + \left[e - m(r)\right]f_1(r ) & = & 0.\end{aligned}\ ] ]    confinement is enforced by choosing @xmath65 to be constant inside the well and tending to infinity for @xmath66 , which leads to the mit bag model boundary conditions @xcite . the ground - state solution for the case @xmath67 for @xmath68 , which will be used throughout this paper , is @xmath69,\end{aligned}\ ] ] with @xmath70 and @xmath71 here @xmath72 for the ground state , which gives @xmath73 mev for @xmath74 fm . when this wave function is used for the up and down quarks the second and third moments , which can be calculated analytically , are @xmath75 and @xmath76 while an analytic form can be derived for the third zemach moment , it is lengthy and involves the sine integral , so we give only its numerical value , @xmath77    the wave functions of the up and down quarks are identical in this zero mass case , and we denote them as @xmath78 . this approximation leads to the important simplification that the charge density of the proton , even though it consists of three quarks , can be written in terms of @xmath78 , @xmath79 we will see that in our calculations of one- and two - coulomb photon exchange this density will enter in exactly the same way as it does in sec . ii in parts of the calculation , thereby reproducing the results of that section with the static - well model charge density . extra terms arising from the field theory approach will be identified with polarizability effects . were we to use different masses , the charge densities of the up and down quarks would differ , and in that case we would use @xmath80 the @xmath81 and @xmath16 atomic wavefunctions for the lepton are the standard dirac - coulomb solutions and will be denoted as @xmath82 . as proton structure effects are strongly suppressed for the @xmath16 case , even though we will continue to use @xmath17 in formulas , in practice we will always assume @xmath83 . the radius @xmath84 is the only variable in this calculation , and we will use different values to study the @xmath84 dependence of what is by far the largest proton structure correction , the finite size correction from one - photon exchange . however , because all other proton structure effects are much smaller , the value 1.2 fm is understood to be used for those corrections .    for the calculation carried out here , which involves a quark propagating in the well , we use the same kind of spectral decomposition as given in eq . ( [ spectral ] ) , @xmath85 the sum over @xmath18 for the lepton and @xmath20 for the quark green functions can be carried out using the method of finite basis sets @xcite , which have been used extensively for atomic calculations , with only minor modifications of the associated computer code required for application to the quark green function . this is because the atomic calculations were set up in the same kind of confining well as used here , but in that case only for the purpose of discretizing the spectrum , with the well radius chosen to be much larger than the atom or ion being considered . we will need the explicit form for the spin - up and spin - down proton wave function , with the former being @xmath86\left|0 \right>. \label{eq : qwf}\end{aligned}\ ] ] in eq . ( [ eq : qwf ] ) @xmath87 and @xmath88 denote spin up and down states of an up quark and @xmath89 and @xmath90 spin up and down states of a down quark ; @xmath91 is the levi - civita symbol , which makes the proton a color singlet after the implicit sum over colors @xmath92 is carried out . because we are taking the up and down quark masses equal to zero , the associated wave function @xmath93 can be replaced by @xmath94 and @xmath95 by @xmath96 , which simplifies later formulas . when the spin state of the quark is not important , we simply use @xmath78 . energy shifts are calculated with the use of @xmath97-matrix techniques , where we use sucher s generalization of the gell - mann low formula @xcite , @xmath98\right|v   \right>.\ ] ] here @xmath99 indicates that a factor @xmath100 is included in the time integral over the hamiltonian density in order to adiabatically turn off the interaction at large positive and negative times . the advantage of this formula is that the @xmath97-matrix can be described with standard feynman diagram techniques , with the adiabatic factors usually trivially leading to a factor @xmath101 that cancels the @xmath102 in the numerator of the above formula , though when we deal with two - photon diagrams , the formalism is needed to cancel disconnected diagrams . details of how this works along with other technical issues can be found in ref . that work described a calculation of two - photon exchange diagrams contributing to energy shifts of excited states of heliumlike ions , but the basic approach is almost identical . the most important difference is that while in that work @xmath103 describes two electrons , here it describes one electron or muon and three quarks , and is given by @xmath104    the diagrams that involve one photon are given in figs . [ hlamb ] ,  [ qlamb ] , and [ 1xqh ] . [ hlamb ] is the standard one - loop lamb shift , which has been evaluated to spectroscopic accuracy . [ qlamb ] is the electromagnetic self energy of the proton , which was calculated using the feynman gauge in ref . the simplest diagram to evaluate is fig . [ qlamb1 ] , photon exchange between pairs of quarks . it contributes @xmath105 mev to the proton electromagnetic self energy , all of which comes from the vector part of the photon exchange . more difficult to calculate is the self - energy diagram of fig . [ qlamb2 ] . this diagram in general requires the inclusion of a self - mass counter term , though not for the zero mass case . after this subtraction an ultraviolet - divergent vertex term generally remains , but because the quarks move freely within the well the ultraviolet divergent part of this term vanishes , and numerical evaluation yields @xmath106 mev ( the results given in ref .  @xcite referred to in the introduction are based on the radius @xmath107 fm , but because they scale as @xmath108 a factor @xmath0 must be inserted for comparison to the present work ) . we note that vacuum polarization terms do not contribute for an isolated proton , but may be of interest for muonic hydrogen , an issue that will be discussed further in the conclusion . finally , figs .  3a and 3b describe exchange of a photon between the lepton and the quarks in the proton and the first - order effect of @xmath61 respectively , and we now turn to their numerical evaluation . we evaluate fig .  [ 1xqh ] in the coulomb gauge , and consider only coulomb photon exchange . this leads to the energy shift @xmath109 we have used our approximation of having the up and down quark wave functions being equal , so the sum of the contribution of the three quarks gives the single term @xmath110 . a direct evaluation of this diagram for a state with principal quantum number @xmath20 gives a result very close to @xmath111 , with the difference attributable to relativistic effects and the finite size of the proton built into our model . the associated counter term in fig . [ ct ] contributes @xmath112 for the @xmath81 state it has the value @xmath113 where @xmath114 .    comparing the sum of @xmath115 and @xmath116 to @xmath117 [ eq .  ( [ firstorderpt ] ) ] , one sees that it is exactly reproduced by the field - theory expression . however , because we now have a specific model for @xmath25 , we do not make the approximations made in the qm treatment and instead numerically evaluate it . we find @xmath118 \nonumber \\ e^{(1 ) }   & = &    2.006\,26   \times 10^{-4}~~ { \rm a.u . } ~~[\rm{muonic~hydrogen}],\end{aligned}\ ] ] where all digits are significant . the root - mean - square charge radius @xmath119 for @xmath74 fm is @xmath120    we emphasize that this is not meant to be a prediction of the proton s rms radius , it is simply the static - well result when @xmath74 fm . however , if we use this in the standard nonrelativistic expression for the finite size effect in hydrogen given in eq . ( [ rms1 ] ) we get @xmath121 \nonumber \\   e^{(1)}_0   & = &    2.013\,00 \times 10^{-4}~~ { \rm a.u . } ~~[\rm{muonic~hydrogen}],\end{aligned}\ ] ] which differ from the exact result by 0.07% and 0.34% respectively . thus we see that the calculation reproduces the bulk of the nonrelativistic expression for the effect of finite nuclear size on @xmath81 energy levels . in the following , while the basic parameter of the static - well model is the well radius @xmath84 , we use eq . ( [ rvsrp ] ) to replace it by @xmath122 in all formulas dependent on @xmath84 . as we have a complete model of the charge distribution , these small deviations can be attributed to higher moments and relativistic effects . by carrying out the calculation for a range of @xmath84 around 1.2 fm , we find the fits @xmath123\ , { \rm a.u.}\ ] ] for hydrogen and @xmath124 \ , { \rm a.u.}\ ] ] for muonic hydrogen , where @xmath125 denotes @xmath119 in units of fermis ( femtometers ) . we first note that the coefficients of the first and second terms for hydrogen increase by close to a factor of @xmath126 and @xmath127 respectively for muonic hydrogen , consistent with the dependence on @xmath14 shown in eqns . ( [ rms1 ] ) and ( [ rms2 ] ) . the coefficients agree at a level of the order of one tenth of a percent . we originally attempted the fit with a quadratic term in @xmath125 instead of a term with the exponent @xmath128 , but were forced to use the latter form for hydrogen to get a proper fit . ( the effect is less important for muonic hydrogen ) . in fact , it is known that the actual dependence of leading finite - size correction on @xmath125 is not the nonrelativistic quadratic form , but instead the relativistic form used above , as shown in ref .  @xcite . in perturbation theory , the leading effect of the fractional power is a correction given by the taylor expansion of @xmath129 , which leads to a logarithmic term of relative order @xmath130 . as mentioned in the introduction , the proton electromagnetic self energy has contributions from the feynman diagrams of fig .  2 . before discussing how these diagrams are modified when the lepton interacts with the proton , which can be thought of as the lamb shift of the proton , we mention another lamb shift related term . this other effect , while negligible for hydrogen because it is of relative order @xmath131 , makes a small contribution for muonic hydrogen , and is not suppressed at all for positronium , accounting for the self energy of the positron in that system . it was first derived by fulton and martin @xcite , and is given by @xmath132.\ ] ] this recoil effect , which shifts the @xmath81 energy in muonic hydrogen by @xmath133 mev , is not included in our approach . an isolated proton can of course emit and reabsorb a photon , giving rise to the electromagnetic self energy of the proton just mentioned . this contributes to the mass of the proton , but when the proton is in a bound state an additional shift arises , described in lowest order by the feynman diagrams in figs . [ pqls1 ] and [ pqls2 ] . we note in passing that these diagrams do not have an analog in the qm treatment , as they involve internal electromagnetic interactions in the proton . in this paper we restrict our attention to the second of these diagrams , which we refer to as exchange corrections to the em self energy of the proton and label as @xmath134 . this is justified by the behavior of the lowest - order proton electromagnetic self energy , where the size of the exchange term and the quark self energy are of the same magnitude . the photon propagators are both taken to be coulomb propagators , and it is straightforward to show that this set of diagrams gives the energy shift @xmath135 in this equation @xmath136 and @xmath137 are understood to be summed over the two flavors and appropriate sums over color indices are implicit ; @xmath138 is the charge of the up or down quark in units of @xmath139 depending on whether @xmath140 or @xmath141 respectively ; @xmath142 , @xmath143 , and their adjoints are field operators , but @xmath144 and its adjoint are wavefunctions , with the sum over @xmath20 going over all allowed values of angular momentum , @xmath145 and @xmath146 , and the positive- and negative - energy states associated with @xmath145 . for two coulomb photons , one can show that only @xmath147 yields a non - zero contribution . after taking the normal - ordered product of the quark fields between the spin up wave function of the proton and noting the integrations over angles are all elementary , one is left with the sum @xmath148 } \frac{1}{\epsilon_\rg - \epsilon_n }    \int_0^r \rd x \,x^2 r_{\rg\rg}(x ) \int_0^r \rd y \,y^2 r_{\rg n}(y )     \nonumber \\ \int_0^r \rd z \,z^2 r_{n\rg}(z ) \int_0^{\infty } \rd w \,w^2 r_{vv}(w )   \,\frac{1}{{\max}(x , y ) } \ , \frac{1}{{\max}(z , w)}\ , ,   \label{eq : expls}\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath149 $ ] denotes summation over all @xmath150-states except the @xmath22 state , and @xmath151 we find , using finite basis sets to carry out the sum over @xmath149 $ ] , that @xmath152 the smallness of this effect is related to the fact the integral over @xmath153 in eq . ( [ eq : expls ] ) is @xmath154 which vanishes when @xmath155 from the orthogonality of the radial wave functions . this restricts the muon wave function to lie within the nucleus , which gives a large suppression factor that scales as @xmath156 . this same suppression factor should make the diagram of 4b , which is more difficult to evaluate , numerically unimportant . however , an interesting application of our approach would be the calculation of vacuum polarization . this was shown in ref . @xcite to vanish for a free proton , but when bound in an atom the arguments for its vanishing no longer apply , and in fact this should correspond to the effect of hadronic vacuum polarization , which is treated as a small effect , estimated in ref . @xcite to be 0.011 mev . however , we are not aware of any direct calculation of this term with zero - mass quarks , and will discuss how such a calculation could be carried out in the conclusions section .    before turning to two - photon effects , we give more details about the use of finite basis sets . as described in ref . @xcite , atomic finite basis set calculations are carried out in a well much larger than the atom , but with the same boundary conditions as used for the quarks . we continue to use an atomic basis set appropriate for hydrogen , but add a second basis set for the quarks , which is obtained by simple modifications of the atomic code , involving changing the fermion mass to zero , eliminating the potential , and changing from atomic units to mev - fm units . atomic grids are created on an exponential grid of the form @xmath157 $ ] . we use the same grid for both quark and lepton wavefunctions . this is done by choosing parameters such that if , for example , a 1000 point grid were used for the atom , the two hundredth point would be at @xmath158 fm , so that the quark wave function would be put on a 200 point grid that matched the atomic grid , though of course the quark wave function vanishes for @xmath159 . several grids were used to test numerical stability . as is also the case for leptons , a complete set of positive and negative energy states result for each possible value of @xmath145 , in this case @xmath160 positive energy @xmath150-states and @xmath160 negative energy @xmath150-states , with a typical value of @xmath160 being 50 . for leptons the effect of the negative - energy states is generally very small , entering at the order of the lamb shift . however , for quarks they play a more important role . we now turn our attention to diagrams shown in fig .  5 . in this section we will show that they in part reproduce the second order perturbation theory expression for @xmath161 , eq . ( [ secondorderpt ] ) in section ii , but have in addition extra terms we identify as proton polarizability . to compare with individual diagrams , it is useful to employ eq . ( [ vparts ] ) to represent @xmath162 in terms of @xmath163 , which yields four terms for eq . ( [ secondorderpt ] ) : @xmath164 @xmath165 @xmath166 and @xmath167    the simplest diagram , fig . 5a , is easily shown to give @xmath168 . the diagrams of fig . 5b and its complex conjugate give @xmath169 and @xmath170 if we identify @xmath171 as in the treatment of one - photon exchange . this leaves only @xmath172 to be accounted for . in general one contribution to it comes from fig . 5c , given by @xmath173 where the definition of @xmath138 is the same as in sec . [ sec : spse ] . the various contributions to this term happen to sum to zero for the proton in our model , but we note they would not were we considering the neutron , or if we were taking the up and down quark wave functions to be different .    the final two diagrams , 5d and 5e , are referred to as the ladder ( l ) and crossed ladder ( xl ) respectively . the closed loop in these diagrams is associated with an integration over a virtual energy . because in this paper we consider only two - coulomb photon exchange , the analysis of the loop integral is considerably simpler than the case where the photon propagators have energy dependence . that complication was encountered in the full feynman gauge analysis of ladder and crossed ladder diagrams in excited states of heliumlike ions @xcite , upon which the present calculation is patterned . issues involved in carrying out the full calculation will be discussed in the conclusion . in this simpler case we can carry out the integral over the timelike component of the loop momentum with cauchy s theorem , which requires identifying the poles coming from the propagators . we partition the lepton and quark propagators into positive and negative energy parts , which could lead to four contributions for each diagram , but the position of the poles is such that only two contributions fail to vanish . the surviving terms are @xmath174 and @xmath175 for the ladder diagram , and @xmath176 and @xmath177 for the crossed ladder . the relative minus sign between the two ladder and the two crossed ladder terms comes from closing the contour in different ways , and we note that the coulomb propagators are different for the ladder and crossed ladder diagrams . in the following we will give formulas only for @xmath178 and @xmath179 as the other terms differ from these only by an overall minus sign and a reversed role of positive and negative energy states . at this point we divide the sum over intermediate quark states into a part with @xmath180 , which leaves the proton unchanged and corresponds to elastic scattering , and the remaining part , corresponding to inelastic scattering , which gives the polarizability contribution . we now show that the elastic term contains @xmath172 . as @xmath181 is positive energy , only @xmath178 and @xmath179 contribute . because the quark states are now all @xmath150-states , the angular - momentum dependence is particularly simple . the coulomb propagators can be simplified with the replacements @xmath182 with @xmath183 , @xmath184 . ( for later use we define @xmath185 , @xmath186 . ) integration over angles then yields @xmath187 with @xmath18 being forced to be an @xmath150 state . we have introduced the shorthand @xmath188    because @xmath189 , this reproduces the part of @xmath172 in which the electron propagator involves sums over positive energy states . in order to include the part with negative energy states the crossed ladder must be considered . the minus sign mentioned above is needed for the energy denominators to match , and the fact that @xmath190 is symmetric under interchange of @xmath191 and @xmath192 is also needed . thus part of the ladder and crossed ladder diagrams together with the other diagrams of fig .  5 simply reproduce second - order perturbation theory with a particular form for the charge distribution of the proton . we evaluated these terms numerically as a test of the coding , since the qm treatment yields a nonrelativistic ( nr ) limit for comparison . the result for muonic hydrogen is @xmath193 which is within @xmath194 of the nr formula . we recall that formula has a mixture of the zemach term and a @xmath195 term , where the latter cancels part of the one - loop result . we now turn to the evaluation of the remaining parts of the ladder and crossed ladder . the quark propagator is treated in the same manner as described in sec . [ sec : spse ] . the feature of the basis set mentioned in that section , whereby it automatically breaks into a positive and a negative energy part , makes separation of the various diagrams a simple matter . we begin with the case where @xmath196 , but where we do not allow the intermediate quark to be in the ground state . the result for the ladder is @xmath197 mev , and is almost completely cancelled by the crossed ladder , which contributes @xmath198 mev , making this channel completely negligible .    in order to treat higher partial waves we must now specify the spin state of the atom . polarizability is important only for the @xmath81 state , which of course can be a triplet or singlet state once the spin of the proton is considered . for one - coulomb - photon exchange these states have the same energy , as hyperfine splitting comes from transverse photon exchange , which is not treated here . however , with two - photon exchange , even when both are coulomb photons , the triplet and singlet energies differ except for the @xmath199 partial wave discussed above . we therefore present in the following formulas for the energy levels of the @xmath81 singlet and triplet .    while each coulomb propagator has its own partial wave expansion , leading in general to a double sum over @xmath200 and @xmath201 , the fact that the quarks are all in @xmath150-states leads to the simplification that these values are equal , @xmath202 . another simplification is that for a given @xmath203 , only @xmath204 and @xmath145 values associated with that value give a non - vanishing contribution . we define angular factors @xmath205 for the ladder and @xmath206 for the crossed ladder diagrams , which are rational fractions resulting from the integrations over angles and sums over magnetic quantum numbers , tabulated in table ii for @xmath207 and @xmath208 . both the triplet and singlet state results are given , though in this paper we are only interested in fine structure . @xmath207 corresponds to the dominant dipole transition . in terms of these coefficients , the formula for the ladder is @xmath209 and for the crossed ladder is @xmath210 where @xmath211 and @xmath212 .       ' '' ''    ' '' ''    ' '' ''    ' '' ''       these can be evaluated with the techniques described above with only simple changes , as the spline basis set contains all values of @xmath213 needed and the radial integrals over @xmath214 are evaluated with techniques valid for arbitrary @xmath203 . the main numerical problem was ensuring that the typical rapid convergence of splines in atomic physics carried over to this problem . the calculation shows that the effect of the @xmath208 channel is very small , with almost the entire effect of polarizability coming from the @xmath207 dipole channel , which shifts the @xmath81 energy down by 0.026 mev . this leads to our main polarizability result for the splitting , @xmath215 consistent with the results from dispersion relation analyses , as will be discussed in the conclusions . one of the basic electromagnetic properties of the proton is its static polarizability , which has an electric and a magnetic component . we concentrate on the static electric polarizability , which is given by the particle data group as @xmath216 while this value is extracted from compton scattering data together with dispersion theory arguments @xcite , in the static - well model the lowest - order expression comes from the diagram of fig .  6 , where the line with a cross indicates a constant electric field with magnitude @xmath217 . the energy shift is related to the static electric polarizability through @xmath218 we note two similar calculations using the closely related mit bag model @xcite , @xcite have been presented , but detailed comparison with their results is not possible . a factor of @xmath219 has been absorbed into the external field . the basic equation for the energy shift of a proton in the presence of a constant electric field described by the potential @xmath220 is @xmath221 which reduces to @xmath222 for this case the orientation of the quark spin does not matter , so the expression simplifies to @xmath223 where we have now isolated the factor @xmath224 to give the formula in terms of @xmath225 . we emphasize at this point that this is a field theoretic derivation , and that the sum over @xmath20 is complete , including negative - energy states .    introducing the notation [ see eq . ( [ eq : sprod ] ) ] @xmath226 after integration over coordinate angles we find @xmath227    we calculated the two terms with basis set techniques . the most striking result found was that the @xmath23 channel vanishes . if one sums over only positive energy states one obtains a nonzero result , but inclusion of the negative energy states leads to an exact cancellation . this situation does not occur for the @xmath24 channel , which in our model is solely responsible for the proton static polarizability . we also calculated @xmath225 using a form for the quark propagator that does not rely on the spectral decomposition given in eq . ( [ quarkprop ] ) . after rewriting eq . ( [ alphapdef ] ) as @xmath228 we use the fact that the quark green function satisfies the differential equation @xmath229 with appropriate boundary conditions . without those conditions this is the same equation that a free fermion green function satisfies , and a simple modification of the well - known partial - wave expansion of the latter propagator can be made to solve for the quark propagator . we illustrate this for the green function of a massless quark with positive @xmath230 and @xmath231 , in which case @xmath232 \chi_{\kappa \mu}(\bm{\hat{x } } ) \\ \ri \left[h_{l-1}(\epsilon_\rg x ) + a_l j_{l-1}(\epsilon_\rg x)\right ] \chi_{-\kappa \mu}(\bm{\hat{x } } ) \end{array } \right )   \nonumber\\[10 pt]&&\qquad\qquad\qquad\times \left(\begin{array}{c@{\qquad}c } j_l(\epsilon_\rg y ) \chi^{\dagger}_{\kappa \mu}(\bm{\hat{y } } ) & -\ri j_{l-1}(\epsilon_\rg y ) \chi^{\dagger}_{-\kappa \mu}(\bm{\hat{y}})\end{array}\right).\end{aligned}\ ] ] the coefficients @xmath233 are determined by the boundary condition . the fact that the propagator ranges over a finite volume allows the admixture of the solution proportional to @xmath233 which is forbidden for a free propagator because of the boundary condition as @xmath234 . when @xmath23 , the integrand in eq . ( [ eq : spol ] ) includes the factor @xmath235 which vanishes . an analogous factor on the left - hand - side when @xmath236 also vanishes . however , for @xmath24 there is no such cancellation , and using @xmath237 we find the numerical result @xmath238    the spectral decomposition discussed previously gives the same result , and one can see the sum is dominated by the first @xmath239 state , with higher-@xmath20 positive - energy and negative - energy states entering at under one tenth of a percent . this result is a factor of two larger than the experimental value in eq . ( [ eq : epol ] ) . however , we note that the relation of the pdg result quoted to static polarizability determined from energy shifts involves some subtleties , discussed in @xcite and more recently in @xcite . in this paper we present an approach to calculating the effect of the electromagnetic structure of the proton on energy levels of muonic hydrogen that uses a simple bound - state model for the proton , with only one free parameter , the radius of the well , which we have chosen to be @xmath74 fm . once the formalism is set up , standard techniques of quantum field theory can be used to evaluate proton structure effects using this parameter , in contrast to the standard approach , which involves the analysis of forward photon proton scattering . we do not claim our approach is better , only that it introduces a different way of looking at the problem . we have considered only coulomb photons in this paper . this is because our primary concern was in setting up the basic formalism , and testing it in the relatively tractable case of coulomb photon exchange . to continue , while one could stay in the coulomb gauge and introduce transverse photons , it is simpler to simply change to the feynman gauge . because the quarks all have the same energy , much of the work here is effectively already in the feynman gauge , with @xmath240 continuing the calculation to this more complete state will allow the treatment of the interesting case of hyperfine splitting . the difficulties of proton structure are well known to be exacerbated in this case , with even ground - state hydrogen hfs uncertain at the sixth digit . our approach should allow a direct calculation of what is often referred to as dynamic proton polarizability , as well as allowing a systematic treatment of other spin dependent effects that sometimes are difficult to disentangle . these calculations are complicated by the fact that the loop energy integral can no longer be evaluated with cauchy s theorem . instead one must carry out a wick rotation to the imaginary axis and carry out the integral numerically . this rotation requires care because of the presence of poles and cuts in the complex plane , which leads to a number of extra terms . we have shown that in our method a term , while extremely small , that can be thought of as the lamb shift of the proton arises . the smallness of the effect had very much to do with the fact that all three quarks are taken to be in the @xmath22 state , which limits the @xmath213 values allowed for the propagator . it is an interesting open question as to how this effect would change if corrections to the proton wave function involving non-@xmath150 states were present , as they presumably are because of gluon exchange , but that is outside the scope of this paper . we have shown that the one - photon diagrams together with the part of the two - photon diagrams where the proton is unchanged give the result @xmath241~\mbox{mev}.\ ] ] this was calculated without the large recoil corrections present in muonic hydrogen : multiplying the appropriate factors of @xmath242 and @xmath243 into the first and second terms , our result becomes @xmath244~\mbox{mev}.\ ] ]    the polarizability of the proton was calculated in a novel fashion . the basic result of this paper is that despite the difference in approach , a similarly small result is found . specifically , again restoring recoil corrections by multiplying our result by @xmath243 , we have found the proton polarizability correction @xmath245 while inclusion of transverse photons may lead to quantitative changes , we consider it unlikely that a qualitative change will result . we now compare our results with ref . @xcite , where the formula @xmath246 is given in their eq . ( 32 ) , with the breakdown of @xmath247 mev given in table i along with results from other calculations that differ by under 2 @xmath248ev . the quadratic term compares well when a term @xmath249 arising from radiative corrections to finite size , not treated here , is removed . the breakup of @xmath250 involves three terms , a subtraction term of @xmath251 mev , an elastic term of @xmath252 mev , and an inelastic term of @xmath253 mev . the first has no counterpart in our calculation , but if we identify the elastic term with our zemach contribution of @xmath254mev and the inelastic with our polarization of @xmath255 mev we see fairly good agreement . perhaps the most interesting calculation left undone in this framework is vacuum polarization . this of course dominates the muonic hydrogen @xmath5 splitting when an electron is in the vacuum polarization loop , but in our framework we could also put in the zero - mass quarks confined in the well into the loop . for an isolated proton , symmetry arguments @xcite show that vacuum polarization vanishes , but once in an atom the arguments no longer hold , and a finite effect should be present . the standard approach is to introduce pion loops , in which case the previously mentioned very small `` hadronic vacuum polarization '' value of 0.011 mev results , but this approach is quite different . such calculations are , however , particularly challenging because of the high degree of divergence present , which always presents difficulties for bound - state methods . we are investigating whether techniques that have proved useful in studying vacuum polarization effects in atoms @xcite , where careful grouping of angular momentum contributions allows an accurate treatment of highly - divergent terms , can be extended to this novel case . a. chodos , r.l . jaffe , k. johnson , c.b . thorn , and v.f . weisskopf , phys . d * 9 * , 3471 ( 1974 ) . w. furry , phys . rev . * 81 * , 115 ( 1951 ) . mohr and j. sapirstein , phys . a * 62 * , 052501 ( 2000 ) p.j . mohr and j. sapirstein , phys . lett . * 54 * , 514 ( 1985 ) . r. pohl _ et . nature * 466 * , 213 ( 2010 ) ; a. antognini _ et . _ , _ science _ , 339 ( 6618 ) ( 2013 ) . r.j . hill and g. paz , phys . rev . d*82 * , 113005 ( 2010 ) . r. pohl , r. gilman , g.a . miller , pohl , and k. pachucki , arxiv:1301.0905 , ( 2013 ) . mohr , b.n . taylor , and d.b . newell , rev . phys . * 84 * , 1527 ( 2012 ) . artemyev , v.m . shabaev , and v.a . yerokhin , phys . a * 52 * , 1884 ( 1995 ) . j. sapirstein and k.t . cheng , phys . rev . a*83 * , 012504 ( 2011 ) . p. beiersdorfer , a.l . osterheld , j.h . scofield , j.r . crespo lopez - urrutia , and k. widmann , phys * 80 * , 3022 ( 1998 ) . mohr , at . data nucl . data tables * 29 * , 453 ( 1983 ) . t. fulton and p.c . phys . rev . * 95 * , 811 ( 1954 ) . k. pachucki , phys . a * 52 * , 1079 ( 1995 ) . johnson , s.a . blundell , and j. sapirstein , phys . a * 37 * , 307 ( 1988 ) . j. sucher , phys . rev . * 109 * , 1010 ( 1958 ) ; m. gell - mann and f. low , phys . rev . * 84 * , 350 ( 1951 ) . blundell , k.t . cheng , and j. sapirstein , phys . a * 55 * , 1857 ( 1997 ) . lvov , int . phys . a * 8 * , 5267 ( 1993 ) . a. schafer , b. muller , d. vasak and w. greiner , phys . lett . b*143 * , 323 ( 1984 ) . b. hecking and g.f . bertsch , phys . b*99 * , 237 ( 1981 ) . hill , gabriel lee , gil paz , and mikhail p. solon , arxiv:1212.4508 ( 2012 ) . gerhard soff and peter j. mohr , phys . rev . a*38 * , 5066 ( 1988 ) .","The text describes a study on the proton's electromagnetic properties, specifically its charge radius, magnetic moment, and static electric and magnetic polarizabilities.

"the field of non - equilibrium statistical physics is related to those problems for which a hamiltonian formulation is not possible or the detailed - balance condition is not satisfied . one of these problems is the study of surface growth and interfaces , where the understanding of the basic mechanisms is the key to developing thin - film devices with important technological applications @xcite .    in this work we are interested in the description of the morphology of a surface formed by adding particles to an initially flat substrate . particles , having one unit height and linear size @xmath5 , land horizontally onto the surface , or over a straigth line in the case of a one - dimensional substrate , and are not allowed to diffuse . in this way , we calculate the interface width , @xmath6 , a function that determines the roughness of the interface , where @xmath7 is the linear size of the substrate and @xmath8 is the time variable . the simplest known model for the deposition of particles is the random deposition , where particles are aggregated onto an initially flat substrate , and lateral correlations among the deposited particles are completely neglected . for this trivial model , its continuous and discrete atomistic versions have exact solutions . the simplest non - trivial growth models , which incorporate spatial and temporal correlations , can be described by means of stochastic differential equations . the edwards - wilkinson ( ew ) equation @xcite is designed to take into account the surface relaxation and height - height correlations in some deposition models . on the other hand , when we need to include some lateral growth of the interface , as in the ballistic deposition of particles @xcite , the appropriate stochastic equation is the non - linear kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) equation @xcite . the ( ew ) and ( kpz ) equations can be written as    @xmath9 \label{ew}\ ] ]    and @xmath10 , \label{kpz}\ ] ] where @xmath11 represents the random fluctuations in the deposition processes .    in order to calculate the interface width , we determine the vertical height of a given point of the surface relative to the substrate , @xmath12 , where * r * denotes the position of a cell over the substrate . the roughness @xmath6 is defined as the mean square fluctuation of the height , @xmath13^{2}\rangle^{1/2}$ ] , where @xmath14 is the average value of the surface height at a given instant of time @xmath8 . it is well established that for a large class of growth models the family - vicsek scaling relation applies @xcite    @xmath15    where the scaling function @xmath16 is a constant for very large values of @xmath17 , and @xmath18 when @xmath19 . the exponent @xmath1 characterizes the interface width at long times , @xmath20 is the dynamic exponent , while @xmath21 is the exponent associated to the initial stages of the growth . these exponents are not at all independent , and are related by @xmath22 .    in the theoretical studies performed in the area of surface growth , one is interested in the calculation of these exponents . there are many studies in the literature concerning the properties of the growth models where calculations have been done analytically , or through the extensive use of monte carlo simulations @xcite .    in this work we use monte carlo simulations to study the surface growth in @xmath23 and @xmath24 dimensions due to the deposition of particles of different sizes . there are in literature some studies where two or more different deposition models are combined @xcite , or two different species of particles are deposited @xcite in order to describe real systems . here , we choose our particles to be deposited from a modified poisson distribution . this type of distribution appears to be relevant in some ash particles deposition on the heat exchange surfaces @xcite . recently , we have investigated the surface growth generated by the random deposition of particles of different sizes in one and two dimensions @xcite . the results of our simulations have shown that in both dimensions , the roughness evolves in time following three different behaviors . the roughness at the initial times behaves as in the random deposition model , where correlations are absent . at intermediate times , the surface roughness depends on the dimensionality of the system , and finally , at long times , it enters into the saturation regime . however , there is a remarkable difference in the results we find in one and two dimensions , regarding the behavior of the interface width at the intermediate times . while in one dimension , the growth exponent is independent of the particle size , in two dimensions it increases with the size of the particle . this happens because when we try to deposit a new particle in one dimension , it can be accomodated in one of the two ends of an already deposited particle , independently of its size . however , in two dimensions , the new deposition can be done in the @xmath25 positions around a deposited particle , where @xmath5 is the linear size of the particle . this dependence on @xmath5 makes the growth in two dimensions to be non - universal . in the present study particles of linear size @xmath5 are dropped randomly over a finite one- or two - dimensional substrate . all the particles considered in the deposition process are one unit height and length sizes in the range @xmath26 . the most important difference between this model and the simple random deposition model , is that our model naturally allows for correlations among the columns , that is , it leads to a lateral growth of the interface . figure  [ deposition ] is a graphic representation of the one - dimensional deposition of a mixture of particles , which are selected from a modified poisson distribution , where the maximum particle size is @xmath27 .    . in this figure particles are selected from a modified poisson distribution of mean value @xmath28 . time grows from bottom to top , where the interface width reached the stationary state . ]    in two dimensions , a particle is aggregated only if the chosen site for deposition coincides with the midpoint of the particle , and there is enough space to accomodate it in the @xmath17 or @xmath29 directions . otherwise , if the cell is already occupied or there is no enough space for the deposition , the particle is reflected away due to these geometric constraints . particles are not allowed to diffuse or share the same cell in any deposition plane . when we are depositing identical particles , during a unit of time , we try to deposit @xmath30 particles , which roughly means the deposition of one layer . for the deposition of particles of same size @xmath5 in a one - dimensional substrate , during a unit of time we try to deposit @xmath31 particles . therefore , depending on the size of the particle , many trials of deposition are not successful in the unit of time . in this section we only show some plots for the deposition in two dimensions . our monte carlo simulations were performed on square lattices with linear size ranging from @xmath32 to @xmath33 . we exhibit in figure  [ roughnessxt ] the log - log plot of the interface width as a function of time for particles of size @xmath34 . at the initial times of deposition , the growth exponent @xmath35 is close to that of the random deposition . at intermediate times , the growth exponent exhibits a completely different behavior from the one observed in one dimension @xcite . in one dimension , the growth exponent @xmath2 at intermediate times , does not depend on the size of particle and its value is @xmath36 . in two dimensions , this exponent exhibits a very peculiar behavior . while for @xmath37 its value is around @xmath38 , which is smaller than @xmath35 , it jumps , for @xmath39 , to the value @xmath40 . for @xmath41 it increases , but the rate of increasing is lower for higher values of @xmath5 .    , and the linear size of the square lattice is @xmath42 . ] we show in figure  [ roughness ] the behavior of the interface width for the deposition on a square substrate of linear size @xmath42 for a mixture of particles with sizes in the range @xmath26 . every time we try to deposit a new particle , it is selected from a modified discrete poisson distribution whose maximum value is @xmath27 . as to be expected the figures we find for the scaling exponents are intermediary between those calculated for the smallest and largest particles .     on a square lattice of side @xmath42 . the values of the growth exponents @xmath35 and @xmath2 are indicated in the plots . ]    in figure 4 we display the values of the growth exponent @xmath2 as a function of @xmath5 for three different lattice sizes . we see that it is almost independent of @xmath7 , but the rate of increasing is very small for higher values of @xmath5 . although not shown , we have also calculated the roughness exponent @xmath1 by extrapolating the saturation value of the interface width observed at long times for large values of @xmath7 and different particles sizes . we have found that @xmath1 is very close to @xmath43 . for the deposition on a linear substrate we have determined the value @xmath44 , which is also independent of @xmath5 . therefore , in one dimension , using this value of @xmath1 , along with @xmath36 , the family -

"coherent transport in discrete low - dimensional mesoscopic quantum systems has attracted much attentions for fundamental physics as well as applications due to persistent technique progress in nanofabrication  @xcite . quantum interference phenomena and quantum coherent transport properties are extensively investigated in various quantum devices  @xcite , interesting effects including fano resonance  @xcite , kondo effect  @xcite , aharonov - bohm ( ab ) effect  @xcite , have been theoretically predicted and experimentally verified in one - dimensional nanostructures system , such as photonic nanocrystals  @xcite , nanowires  @xcite , quantum dots array  @xcite . much effort has been devoted to investigate coherent electron transport properties of a various types of interferometers oriented at different geometries  @xcite . among these , quantum dots embedded two - arm electron wave interferometers are mostly studied , in particular , the ab interferometer  @xcite . the ab interferometer is composed by a two - terminal structure with single or double quantum dots embedded . the two - terminal configuration forms a close ring shape quantum system threading by magnetic flux that is tunable via externally applied magnetic field . studying transport properties of a quantum system is beneficial for understanding quantum processes concerning energy transfer . the applications include quantum state transfer , quantum control and manipulation in quantum information science . the engineered and modulated optical systems mimic a great deal of quantum systems including atomic , molecular in condensed matter physics . for example , the dynamic localization @xcite and bloch oscillation @xcite of electron under static external field are demonstrated in periodically modulated coupled optical waveguides . the optical systems of coupled waveguides and coupled resonators are successfully employed to investigate parity - time symmetry  @xcite . in recent years , quantum optical analogue is a fruitful platform for studying coherent mechanics in quantum realm due to the simplicity and flexibility of photons . photons , as neutral particles , although proved not directly interact with magnetic field , the photonic analogy of ab effect is proposed  @xcite and verified based on dynamic modulation of material permittivity  @xcite , and based on photon - phonon interaction  @xcite . the key point is to realize nonreciprocal photon tunneling . thereafter , the study of quantum phenomena from solids to their artificial electromagnetic counterparts in optics has become a hot topic in quantum physics , quantum information and quantum optics  @xcite . the synthetic artificial gauge field is introduced to simulate and investigate phenomena usually found in electronic systems  @xcite , investigations include the quantum topology in photonic system  @xcite and the photonic analogue of quantum ( anomalous ) hall effect in photonic crystals  @xcite .    here , we study light transport in the presence of synthetic magnetic flux in a ring array of coupled resonators . in the presence of artificial gauge field , photons mimic electrons in magnetic field , a coupled resonators system provides an optical platform for investigating quantum phenomena . the ring array of coupled resonators enclosed synthetic magnetic field acts as a two - arm ab interferometer . as interference is sensitive to the relative phase between light waves propagating in its arms , thus light transmission probability is relevant to the connection positions of the input and output leads , and depends on the enclosed synthetic magnetic flux . the interference and phase sensitive feature reveal the quantum nature of photons . we employ the bethe ansatz method to study the light transport properties . we focus on the influence of a synthetic gauge field on light transport in a ring shaped array with arbitrary number of coupled resonators . the transmission zeros and the resonant transmissions are further discussed . , @xmath0 coupled together via an antiresonant auxiliary resonator ( in blue ) . the optical paths ( green and red arrows ) imbalance induces a nonreciprocal hopping phase between two primary resonators . ( b ) the ring array of coupled resonators enclosed synthetic magnetic flux . the synthetic magnetic flux is introduced through nonreciprocal hoppings between neighbor resonators based on ( a ) . the input lead is connected to resonator @xmath1 , the output lead is connected to resonator @xmath2 . the system acts as a two - arm ab ring interferometer . the output light can be modulated by the enclosed synthetic magnetic flux @xmath3.,width=16 ]    we begin with two coupled passive resonators  @xcite , using coupled mode theory , the dynamics of field amplitudes inside the resonators give @xmath4where @xmath5 , @xmath6 are the field amplitude in the two resonators , @xmath7 is the resonant frequency , @xmath8 is the coupling strength . the coupled resonators system is able to be described by a tight - binding hamiltonian , @xmath9 . similarly , an @xmath10 coupled passive resonators system with resonant frequency @xmath11 and coupling strength @xmath8 is described by @xmath12 , where @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) is the photon creation ( annihilation ) operator for the @xmath15-th resonator with periodical boundary condition that @xmath16 , the roundtrip length of each resonator is @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the light wavelength , @xmath19 is an integer . the synthetic magnetic flux is induced by nonreciprocal hopping phase introduced in coupled resonators as proposed by hafezi  hafezi2014 . for any two adjacent resonators , the hopping is induced through an auxiliary resonator ( fig . [ fig1]a ) . when optical length of the auxiliary resonator is @xmath20 , being antiresonant with two primary resonators , the auxiliary resonator results in an effective coupling strength @xmath8 in between two primary resonators describing by the hamiltonian @xmath21 . in fig . [ fig1]a , light in the resonators is shown in yellow . the forward going path of light from resonator @xmath22 to @xmath0 is shown in green , the backward going path of light from resonator @xmath0 to @xmath22 is shown in red . considering the path length difference between the forward and backward direction is @xmath23 , the effective coupling acquires an additional optical path dependent hopping phase factor @xmath24 with @xmath25 . the auxiliary resonator between two primary resonators induces a nonreciprocal coupling @xmath26 . for a ring configuration shown in fig . [ fig1]b based on the building blocks shown in fig . [ fig1]a , photons circling around the ring array accumulate an ab type phase factor @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) in clockwise ( counterclockwise ) direction , the total phase is @xmath29 . the effective ab type phase introduced in the ring array equivalently realizes a synthetic magnetic flux for photons . the synthetic magnetic field felt by photons is gauge invariant and unaffected by the distribution of nonreciprocal phase as long as the total phase @xmath3 accumulated by photons in one round is unchanged . the ring resonator supports clockwise and counterclockwise modes , here we assume clockwise mode ( yellow circles ) as shown in fig . the situation for counterclockwise mode is similar , where photons feel an exactly opposite synthetic magnetic flux . to be precise , we consider a ring array with @xmath10 coupled resonators threading by synthetic magnetic flux @xmath30 . the system is schematically illustrated in fig . [ fig1]b , each site ( black ball ) represents a ring resonator . the input and output leads connect to the array of coupled resonators at two different resonators ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) . the connection leads split the ring array into two components : the upper arm and the lower arm . the ring array of coupled resonators functions as a two - arm ab interferometer . the light can propagate from input resonator ( @xmath1 ) to output resonator ( @xmath2 ) either in the upper or the lower arm . photons tunneling in the upper arm acquire a difference phase comparing with tunneling in the lower arm , meet at the output resonator and interferes with each other . the light interference depends on the different phases photons acquired in the two propagating paths ( the upper and the lower ring arms ) . therefore , the light output is affected by the synthetic magnetic flux , which alternates the relative phase difference between two optical paths . in this sense , the wave vector of light and the connection positions of the input and output leads also influence the light transmission . in the following , we investigate light transport properties in a ring array of coupled resonators in the framework of interference . the hamiltonian of a two - arm ring interferometer under synthetic magnetic flux is written as @xmath31where @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator of resonator @xmath15 in the upper ring arm . corresponding creation and annihilation operators for resonator @xmath15 of the lower ring arm are denoted by @xmath34 and @xmath35 . in order to investigate the influence of synthetic gauge field in the system , the coupling strength @xmath8 is set unity , the resonators are the same in resonant frequency @xmath36 . there are no disorders in the couplings and no detunings in the array of coupled resonators , the light transport is solely controlled and affected by the synthetic magnetic flux and the ring interferometer structure . we consider the input lead is connected to the ring array at resonators @xmath37 and @xmath38 ( @xmath39 , which is actually resonator @xmath38 ) . the threading synthetic magnetic flux in the ring array is @xmath40 , it acts globally and is invariant under local operator transformations . we study the dynamical process by employing the bethe ansatz method . equivalent descriptions of a ring array of coupled resonators is guaranteed under local operator transformation . for convenience , we take a local transformation @xmath41 with @xmath42 $ ] in the upper ring arm , and @xmath43 with @xmath44 $ ] in the lower ring arm . the hamiltonian is expressed as @xmath45 which describes a one - dimensional coupled ring resonators system with effective nonreciprocal tunneling phase introduced only in between resonators @xmath46 and @xmath47 . photons acquire an additional phase @xmath30 tunneling from resonator @xmath46 to @xmath47 , and acquire an additional phase @xmath48 when tunneling inversely from resonator @xmath47 to @xmath46 . the supporting light frequency in the ring array of coupled resonators is in the range of @xmath49 $ ] . as @xmath8 is set unity , we consider an incident light wave with frequency @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) incoming in the left lead and outgoing in the right lead . the ring array of coupled resonators splits the input wave at connection resonator @xmath1 , a portion of light reflects back to the input lead and others propagate forward in the ring arms ; the forward propagating lights meet at resonator @xmath2 , interfere with each other and form the output . meanwhile , the interference at output resonator @xmath2 also results in a portion of light reflecting back toward input resonator @xmath1 , meeting at the input resonator @xmath1 , interfere and form reflection light in the input lead . in the light propagating process , the ring array of coupled resonators acts as a two - arm ab interferometer . the interference depends on the phase accumulated by photons at each path , which depends on enclosed synthetic magnetic flux in the ring array of coupled resonators . the magnetic flux affects periodically , the phase factor @xmath52 is unchanged for every @xmath53 period of @xmath30 , i.e. , @xmath54 with integer @xmath55 . thus , the light transmission probability in the system satisfies @xmath56 . in fig . [ fig2 ] , we plot the light transmission probabilities for several different configurations with @xmath57 $ ] . moreover , for the ring array shown in fig . [ fig1]b , the transmission probabilities are irrelevant to the direction of the magnetic flux . the magnetic flux is opposite when we turn over the ring array , which indicates an exchanging of the upper and the lower arms of the two - arm ab ring interferometer . this will not change the light interference , and the light transmission remains unchanged . thus , we have @xmath58 , which implies the counterclockwise mode supporting by the coupled resonators system has the same propagating properties as the clockwise mode we are discussing . the ring array of coupled resonators is a hermitian system , the light transmission probabilities are the same for light inputting in either side , this implies a symmetric light transport @xmath59 .    . we schematically illustrate the ring array of coupled resonator in the inserts of ( a ) for no resonator embedded in two arms , ( b ) for one resonator embedded in one arm , and ( c ) for two resonators respectively embedded in two arms . corresponding contours of @xmath60 are plotted in the left panels as functions of the enclosed synthetic magnetic flux and the light wave vector . the middle panels are cuts through contours of @xmath60 at @xmath61 ( red ) and @xmath62 ( blue ) . the right panels are cuts through contours of @xmath60 at @xmath63 ( red ) , @xmath64 ( blue ) , @xmath65 ( green).,width=604 ]    the dynamics in the system is governed by the schrdinger equations . the field amplitude in each resonator has the form @xmath66 . in a rotating frame at oscillating frequency @xmath36 , the stationary resonator modal amplitude @xmath67 inside the ring array of coupled resonators is set as @xmath68 @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 represent the forward and backward propagating light waves with vector @xmath72 , respectively . the stationary resonator modal amplitude in the leads resonators of the input and output leads are set as @xmath73 and @xmath74 . the reflection and transmission coefficients are defined as @xmath75 and @xmath76 for wave vector @xmath72 . due to the interference , light waves in the upper and the low arms of the ring array contain forward transmitted ( green arrow in fig .  [ fig1 ] ) and backward reflected ( red arrow in fig .  [ fig1 ] ) components . in order to calculate the reflection and transmission coefficients , we list the schrdinger equations for all resonators in the whole coupled resonators system . notice that the schrdinger equations for resonator @xmath77 $ ] in the upper arm and resonator @xmath78 $ ] in the lower arm give a series of equations , @xmath79the footnote is @xmath80 . these equations all yield the eigen energy @xmath81 , which implies the dispersion relation , @xmath82 . the remaining schrdinger equations in the ring array together with the boundary conditions ( continuity of wave functions at the connection resonators ) determine the light propagating properties . the boundary conditions mean that the modal amplitude @xmath83 , @xmath84 should be in accordance at resonator @xmath37 and @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) . the boundary conditions at resonator @xmath37 are related to the reflection coefficient , @xmath85similarly , the boundary conditions at resonator @xmath38 are related to the transmission coefficient , @xmath86the schrdinger equation at resonator @xmath87 in the lower ring arm gives @xmath88,\]]this yields another boundary condition at resonator @xmath39 , @xmath89the schrdinger equation for resonator @xmath37 gives@xmath90and for resonator @xmath38 gives @xmath91 + e^{-i\phi } [ x_{\beta } e^{ik(n_{\beta } -1)}+y_{\beta } e^{-ik(n_{\beta } -1 ) } ] = te^{-ik}.   \label{eq:8}\]]from equations ( [ eq:3]-[eq:8 ] ) obtained from the bethe ansatz method , we can exactly calculate the reflection and transmission coefficients @xmath75 , @xmath76 . in the following , we discuss light transmissions in details , in particular , the influence of synthetic magnetic flux . the situation of @xmath92 in the ring array induces a completely destructive interference , that input light is totally reflected with zero transmission . this is an interference effect only relevant to the structure and the input wave vector . the physical interpretation of destructive interference is as follows . the forward and backward going waves interfere in the ring array , forming two standing waves in the two arms . the standing waves are sinusoidal functions that exactly being the eigenstates of uniform tight - binding chains with @xmath93 and @xmath87 coupled resonators , and the interference in the ring array results in vanishing of wave functions at the connection resonators . in this situation , two ring arms that function as transport channels are isolated , and we have @xmath94 , @xmath95 . the input light will be fully reflected without any transmission , while the synthetic magnetic flux will not affect the light propagation . in other aspect , the gauge invariant field introduced in open chain is trial . in the situation of @xmath92 , the ring array of coupled resonators will act as a cage constraining photons of wave vector @xmath72 initially localized in the ring array . photons travel in the ring arms without escaping to the leads .    for the ring array and input wave vector satisfying @xmath96 and @xmath97 , the light wave vector satisfies @xmath98 , the phase acquired by photons in the path of upper ring arm from resonator @xmath37 to resonator @xmath99 is @xmath100 . this indicates the wave functions at two connection resonators have the same amplitude and the same ( opposite ) phase , which depends on the length of upper ring arm , @xmath101 ( @xmath102 ) . the same amplitude of light in the connection resonators implies a none zero transmission . otherwise , zero transmission will reduce to the situation of @xmath92 . in the situation @xmath96 and @xmath97 , none zero light transmission can also be seen from the transmission coefficient @xmath76 , which is calculated by the bethe ansatz method . from eq . ( [ eq:3]-[eq:8 ] ) , we have @xmath103+i\mathrm{sin}(n_{\beta } k)\mathrm{sin}k\ } } ,   \label{eq : t_caseii}\]]where we directly notice the transmission @xmath104 because @xmath97 , and the enclosed synthetic magnetic flux modulates the light transmission probability . the resonant light transmission @xmath105 happens at @xmath106/\mathrm{sin}k$ ] . through tuning the enclosed synthetic magnetic flux in the system , we can always have a resonant light transmission for an input light with wave vector @xmath107 , which corresponds to the input frequency @xmath36 , i.e. , the resonator on - resonance frequency . the on - resonance input is an optimal choice for obtaining resonant light transmission through controlling synthetic magnetic flux . for input wave vector @xmath108 , although a synthetic magnetic flux modulates the light transmission , a resonant light transmission @xmath105 may be impossible by controlling the synthetic magnetic flux , e.g. @xmath109|>|\mathrm{sin}k|$ ] . the case for @xmath110 and @xmath111 is similar , the transmission coefficient obtained is eq . ( eq : t_caseii ) with subscript @xmath112 and @xmath113 switched ( @xmath114 ) and the transmission coefficient @xmath76 substituted by @xmath115 ( @xmath116 ) . now we turn to discuss a general situation . after simplification eq . ( [ eq:3]-[eq:8 ] ) under @xmath117 and @xmath97 , we obtain the transmission coefficient for a two - arm ring interferometer with input and output leads connected at arbitrary positions , the light transmission coefficient of the ring array of coupled resonators threading by synthetic magnetic flux @xmath30 is in form of @xmath118}{\mathrm{sin}(n_{\alpha } k)}+\frac{\mathrm{sin}[(n_{\beta } -1)k]}{% \mathrm{sin}(n_{\beta } k)}-e^{-ik}\right ) ^{2}}.\ ] ] where the transmission zeros @xmath119 happen only when @xmath120 at wave vector @xmath72 fulfills @xmath121 . in other words , the transmission zeros are at wave vector @xmath122 when there is no magnetic flux @xmath123 and @xmath124 when the magnetic flux is at maximum value @xmath125 , where @xmath126 is integer number . the wave functions in the ring arms are sinusoidal functions , waves in the upper and the lower arms interfere destructively due to the extra phase factor @xmath127 in the presents of magnetic flux . the destructive interference effectively opens the ring array at the connection resonator @xmath99 ( @xmath47 ) coupled to the output lead , and the ring arms act like dangling chains . by tuning magnetic flux with other system parameters set , we obtain two reflection zeros at different magnetic flux in a @xmath128 period . the transmission probability @xmath129 for several simple configurations of ring array under magnetic flux are shown in fig . the whole dynamical process is unitary . the reflection is @xmath130 . the ring array with no resonator embedded ( fig . [ fig2]a ) , one resonator embedded ( fig . [ fig2]b ) , and two resonators embedded ( fig .  [ fig2]c ) embedded are shown . moreover , we notice that @xmath125 results in destructive interference in the ab ring interferometer with equal length ( @xmath131 ) . this is because the phase difference of photons reaching the output lead from the upper and from the lower arm is @xmath3 for system with @xmath131 , the magnetic flux induces additional phase factor @xmath132 . therefore , half - integer magnetic flux quantum leads to a destructive interference in the two - arm ab ring interferometer with equal length .    . ( a ) either @xmath133 or @xmath134 is odd . ( b ) both @xmath135 and @xmath134 are odd . the blue line is for system with odd @xmath136 and green line is for system with even @xmath136 . the transmission is zero for @xmath133 and @xmath134 being both even.,width=10 ]    the light with wave vector @xmath137 propagates at the fast velocity @xmath138 , the dispersion relation yields the light frequency is on - resonance with the ring resonators @xmath139 . varying the synthetic magnetic flux enclosed in the ring interferometer , the phase difference photons accumulated in the upper and the lower arms changes , which affects the interference in the ring array . the transmissions probabilities for @xmath137 is plotted as a function of the magnetic flux @xmath30 in fig . [ fig3 ] . for @xmath137 , the destructive interference induces full reflection without any transmission in case the numbers of coupled resonators embedded in the two interferometer arms ( @xmath38 , @xmath39 ) are both even . in the situation that the number of embedded resonators being even in one arm ( @xmath38 or @xmath39 is even ) , the transmission probability equals to @xmath140 , and varies in the range of @xmath141 to @xmath142 as the synthetic magnetic flux . the resonant light transmission happens at @xmath143 , and reaches the minimum @xmath141 at @xmath144 ( fig . [ fig3]a ) . for ring array with @xmath38 , @xmath39 being both odd , the synthetic magnetic flux induces asymmetric fano lineshapes in the transmission ( fig . [ fig3]b ) . in this situation , we have @xmath145 , and the transmission coefficient @xmath146 ( @xmath147 is the amplitude and @xmath148 is the phase ) is closely related to the system structure . if @xmath149 is odd , we have @xmath150 being even , therefore @xmath151}$ ] equals to @xmath152 at half - integer magnetic flux quantum ( @xmath153 , @xmath55 ) , which leads to completely destructive interference ( blue line in fig .

( [ t_na1 ] ) , we notice that in the region @xmath175 and @xmath176 , there is no transmission zero ( @xmath177 ) except for @xmath178 , @xmath55 ( see fig . [ fig4 ] ) . this indicates that only half - integer or integer magnetic flux quantum could lead to complete destructive interference without light transmission . the resonant transmissions ( @xmath179 ) happen at @xmath180 . for @xmath181 ( @xmath55 ) , the transmission amplitude is generally larger than @xmath30 being others and the resonant transmission ( @xmath105 ) happens at @xmath111 . the transmission and reflection are shown in fig .

[ fig4]e and [ fig4]f for @xmath182 and @xmath191 as comparison , where the transmission zeros ( @xmath192 ) are at @xmath193 . the synthetic magnetic flux modulates the light transport , significantly varies @xmath72 for the resonant transmission as well as the transmission zeros . this might be useful in the design of quantum devices such as photon filters or optical switches .    to verify our analysis on transmission probability of the ring array of coupled resonators enclosed synthetic magnetic flux , we simulate light transmission through calculating the dynamical evolution of a gaussian profile wave packet . the profile of the light wave packet is @xmath194 which is centered at the resonator @xmath195 , the coefficient @xmath196 represents the renormalized light intensity of resonator @xmath15 , @xmath197 is the relative phase in each resonators of the incident light wave , and the parameter @xmath198 controls the width of the gaussian profile in the array of coupled resonators . the gaussian wave is localized at its profile center @xmath195 and keeps shape - preserving in the evolution process , in particular , a wide spreading gaussian wave packet  @xcite . the interference of a plane wave with wave vector @xmath72 can be approximately simulated by a gaussian wave packet with velocity @xmath199 in a uniform chain with nearest neighbor coupling strength @xmath8 . to simulate the dynamics , we consider a ring array of coupled resonators threading by synthetic magnetic flux is the central of the system , connected to the input and output leads . the gaussian wave with certain velocity is initially localized in the input lead far away from the central , it moves along the input lead towards the central , interferes in the ring array of coupled resonators and outgoes from the output lead . the dynamical process and transmission probability are shown in the upper and the lower panels of fig .

"it is believed by most astro - cosmologists as well as astro - particle physicists that the only solution to resolve the flatness and horizon problems in the universe is to think of exponential expansion called inflation  @xcite right after birth of our universe . in recent years several observational results to confirm the inflation were reported  @xcite . in particular , the most important evidence in the present days to provide data is the temperature fluctuation of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) which shows us quantitatively that there was the era of the inflation in the early universe . using this data we can investigate the mechanism of the inflationary expansion in detail . the cmb is the photon emitted in the recombination era of which the wavelength is very long so that cmb reaches us without much scattering afterwards . therefore cmb carries to us the information of the early universe . the most peculiar properties of cmb is that it is homogeneous and uniform with very high accuracy and furthermore the spectrum agrees very well with the black body radiation with the temperature 2.725 [ k ] while the temperature fluctuation @xmath7 is of the order of @xmath8 . this temperature fluctuation is believed to come from the gravitational potential @xmath9 through sachs - wolfe effect @xmath10  @xcite . in the usual inflation models the gravitational potential @xmath9 is believed to be created when the hypothetical scalar particle(s ) called inflaton(s ) fluctuates quantum mechanically during rolling down classically along with the potential . there are many models proposed for creation mechanism , such as slow - roll inflation  @xcite , chaotic inflation  @xcite etc . in our previous papers  @xcite , we show that the temperature fluctuation of cmb can be explained as the vacuum fluctuation of a large number of matter fields . here the matter fields are originated from the string excited states and/or the kaluza - klein modes on the compactified space . there appear very many kinds of fields in the exponentially expanding universe , where the hubble parameter plays the role of temperature . these fields fluctuate around the bottom of the mass potential , and generate the energy density of fluctuation . finally the fluctuation creates the gravitational potential @xmath9 through the einstein equation . although each fluctuation due to single field is very small , but enormous number of species of fields contribute and it turns out to be summed up to a huge fluctuation compatible to the present observational value . furthermore it is possible to determine the radii of the compactified spaces , as well as the string coupling constant by comparison with the observational values of cmb . the very merit of our theory is in the fact that we do not need to put any assumption or fine - tuning on the form of the matter fields potential , but we simply consider free fields . however in our above described theory there still are several problems to be resolved . in the first place the spectral index @xmath11 which indicates the distance dependence of the fluctuation or , in other words , the 2-point correlation function of the fields exceeds one , i.e. @xmath12 in our model , although the observed value of the planck is @xmath13  @xcite . as was pointed out in our foregoing papers @xcite the reason why we obtained @xmath12 is in the fact that we assumed the background metric is exactly the de sitter space - time . in order to explain the experimental value of the spectral index , we may have to introduce a time dependent hubble parameter @xmath2 , something like @xmath14 . so far we have not discussed the origin of the inflation , and simply assumed the de sitter space - time . in this paper we point out the possibility that the inflation is caused by the vacuum energy of the many fields in the expanding universe . it is the purpose of the present article that we present a self - consistent theory of the time evolution of the universe by incorporating the backreaction of the quantized matter fields . the main idea of the present paper follows our pervious articles @xcite , except that we do not assume de sitter background and incorporate the backreaction of the matter fields . in the early universe we consider @xmath15 species of the free scalar fields . the time evolution of the early universe is assumed to follow the classical einstein equation , @xmath16 on the right hand side the energy - momentum tensor of the species @xmath17 of the matter fields is regarded as the vacuum expectation value @xmath18 , in the metric @xmath19 . when one expresses @xmath18 by a functional of arbitrary metric @xmath19 , @xmath20 $ ] , the einstein equation ( [ 1-einstein.eq ] ) describes the time evolution of @xmath19 caused by the backreaction from the matter fields . here we take the vacuum of the bunch - davies type in the calculation of @xmath20 $ ] . as we will see @xmath20$]is proportional to @xmath21 . therefore in the early universe , where @xmath2 is large , we can ignore the initial state dependence of the energy - momentum tensor and simply take @xmath20 $ ] . we mainly use the eikonal approximation to make solutions of the equation of motion of the matter fields . then we perform the 1-loop momentum integration to calculate the correlation functions . by so doing the eq . ( [ 1-einstein.eq ] ) becomes a second order differential equation for @xmath2 . the present paper is organized as follows . in section [ 2 ] , we review briefly the eikonal approximation . then we investigate the solution of matter field of mass @xmath22 in two cases , that is , for the cases of @xmath23 and @xmath24 , and evaluate @xmath25 for each cases . in section [ 3 ] we assume that there exist both light and heavy particles in the universe and search for de sitter - like expanding solutions of eq . ( [ 1-einstein.eq ] ) , where @xmath2 is almost constant . then we examine the solutions when the hubble parameter is very small compared to that of the de sitter - like expanding era . from this analysis we will see that the hubble parameter becomes zero and the de sitter era ends for a certain region of the initial conditions . section [ 4 ] is devoted to conclusion and outlook . in appendix [ app - airy ] we describe in detail the calculation by using the airy function around boundary between uv and ir regimes in the eikonal approximation . in appendix [ app - damping ] we show the calculation of the correlation functions using the solution in the ir regime in the eikonal approximation . it is legitimate to assume that the background metric is homogeneous and uniform as are indicated from cmb data . we thus start with investigating the one species of the scalar field described by the action @xmath26 in the friedmann - robertson - walker space - time @xmath27 for the later convenience to apply the dimensional regularization , the space - time dimension in eq . ( [ 2-action ] ) is taken to be @xmath28 with @xmath29 . in terms of the co - moving time @xmath30 we write the differentiation as @xmath31 and then the fourier mode @xmath32 of the rescaled scalar field @xmath33 obeys the following equation of motion : @xmath34\right)\chi_k=0 . \label{2-eom}\end{aligned}\ ] ] here the potential @xmath35 $ ] is defined by @xmath36       & \equiv \left(1-\frac{\epsilon}{2}\right)\frac{a^{\prime \prime}}{a }      -\epsilon \left(\frac{1}{2}-\frac{\epsilon}{4}\right )      \left(\frac{a^{\prime}}{a}\right)^2-m^2a^2 \nonumber \\      & = \left(1-\frac{\epsilon}{2}\right)a^2\left(2h^2+\dot{h}\right )      -\epsilon \left(\frac{1}{2}-\frac{\epsilon}{4}\right)a^2h^2-m^2a^2 ,       \label{2-potential}\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the hubble parameter @xmath37 the quantity we are interested in is the @xmath38-component of the energy - momentum tensor as a functional of @xmath0 ( or @xmath2 ) , @xmath39       & = \frac{\mu^{4-n}}{2}\left\langle\dot{\phi}^2      + \frac{1}{a^2}\left(\nabla \phi \right)^2+m^2\phi^2\right\rangle       \nonumber \\          & = \frac{\mu^{\epsilon}}{2a^{4-\epsilon}}\bigg\ {      \left\langle \left(\chi^{\prime}\right)^2\right\rangle       -\left(1-\frac{\epsilon}{2}\right)ah      \left\langle \chi^{\prime}\chi + \chi \chi^{\prime}\right\rangle       + \left(1-\frac{\epsilon}{2}\right)^2a^2h^2      \left\langle \chi^2\right\rangle \nonumber \\      & \qquad \qquad \quad       + \left\langle \left(\nabla \chi \right)^2\right\rangle       + m^2a^2\left\langle \chi^2\right\rangle \bigg\}.      \label{2-energy - momentum.tensor}\end{aligned}\ ] ] here a mass scale @xmath40 is introduced to keep the mass dimension of the energy - momentum tensor . we solve the equation of motion ( [ 2-eom ] ) with recourse to the eikonal approximation by putting @xmath41 then by using the boundary condition @xmath42 and the assumption of the eikonal approximation @xmath43 ( [ 2-eom ] ) has the solution @xmath44}.      \label{2-eikonal.solution}\end{aligned}\ ] ] here the wronskian is used to normalize the solution : @xmath45 the general solution for @xmath46 is given by @xmath47 in the oscillatory region , @xmath48 we then quantize the field @xmath49 canonically by using the commutation relation @xmath50      = i\delta^{3-\epsilon}(\vec{x}-\vec{y } ) .      \label{2-commutation.relation}\end{aligned}\ ] ] the vacuum state is defined as usual @xmath51 so that the vacuum expectation value of an operator @xmath52 is given by @xmath53 .    in the following we consider the situation where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are much smaller than @xmath2 itself , @xmath56 which means that @xmath2 and @xmath54 vary much slower than the time evolution of the universe .      in this subsection we evaluate the energy density @xmath58 of a scalar field when hubble parameter is much larger than mass ; @xmath57 . it is well known that if @xmath2 is constant @xmath58 is given by @xmath59 note that this result is obtained without using the eikonal approximation .    when @xmath60 and @xmath61 , the potential ( [ 2-potential ] ) is always positive , i.e. @xmath36>0 .      \label{2-potential.is.positive}\end{aligned}\ ] ] then the eq .

hilbert action @xmath82 , respectively . the rest three terms are @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 and from the dimensional analysis their counter terms are given by @xmath86 and @xmath87 . in the case of frw metric ( [ 2-frw.metric ] ) , these two actions give the following additional terms to the euler - lagrange equation : @xmath88 therefore the three coefficients of the @xmath78 term can be renormalized by these two counter terms . in principle we may introduce finite renormalization for the three terms @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath89 . however , since we have to make the same renormalization to the two cases @xmath57 and @xmath90 of the single theory , we relegate to argue this problem after the following subsection [ 2.2 ] for the case of a small hubble parameter @xmath90 . then we make use of the minimal subtraction , and expand ( [ 2-em.tensor-oscillation ] ) for large @xmath2 assuming @xmath91 and @xmath61 : @xmath92    for the regions ( ii ) and ( iii ) the contributions to @xmath93 are described in the appendices [ app -

hilbert action @xmath82 in such a way that @xmath79 and @xmath101 terms and @xmath80 and @xmath102 terms are set to zero . the reason for so doing is because the energy density for small values of @xmath2 should be zero . although we should add the same counter terms to ( [ 2-em.tensor-oscillation-approx ] ) , such terms are negligible when @xmath2 is much larger than @xmath22 . furthermore we may make a finite renormalization for @xmath86 and @xmath87 which generates an additional term @xmath103 to ( [ 2-em.tensor-damping-approx ] ) . so far we have obtained the energy density of a single scalar field for two cases . the explicit form for the case of a large hubble parameter is given by @xmath104 which is the sum of ( [ 2-em.tensor-oscillation-approx ] ) and ( [ 2-em.tensor-airy+damping ] ) . for the case of a small hubble parameter we have @xmath105    we next consider the einstein equation assuming that there are many fields with various masses . then the total energy density is written as @xmath106 where @xmath107 and @xmath108 stand for the numbers of the fields whose masses are lighter and heavier than the hubble parameter , respectively . the ratio of @xmath107 to @xmath108 may vary as the hubble parameter evolves in time . however , the coefficients of each terms in ( [ 3-energy.density-right ] ) and ( [ 3-energy.density-heavy ] ) are roughly the same , so that we may replace @xmath93 and @xmath109 with their average . then ( [ 3-total.energy0 ] ) becomes @xmath110 where @xmath15 is the total number of the species . then the @xmath38-component of the einstein equation reads @xmath111 rewriting this equation after plugging ( [ 3-energy.density-right ] ) and ( [ 3-energy.density-heavy ] ) , we obtain the equation of describing the time evolution of the hubble parameter @xmath2 : @xmath112 where @xmath22 is the typical mass of the fields heavier than the hubble parameter . a comment is in order : the mass scale @xmath40 is originally arbitrary , but as a cut - off scale in the general relativity , field theories and/or string theory , it may be natural to choose planck scale @xmath113 or string scale @xmath114 .      in this subsection we analytically solve the above eq . ( [ 3-einstein.eq ] ) by using linear approximation around the de sitter solution . it is clear that the eq . ( [ 3-einstein.eq ] ) has the solution , where @xmath2 is a constant , @xmath115 which is nothing but the de sitter solution . we next consider a fluctuation @xmath116 around this solution @xmath117 , @xmath118 in the linear approximation the eq . ( [ 3-einstein.eq ] ) becomes @xmath119 where @xmath120 and @xmath121 are constants given by @xmath122 the general solution reads @xmath123    let us turn to investigate the behavior of the solution ( [ 3-einstein.eq-begin-solution ] ) by using observational values . if we assume that the matter field potential is about the forth power of the gut scale , @xmath124}$ ]  @xcite , we obtain @xmath125}.      \label{3-hubble}\end{aligned}\ ] ] consequently , from ( [ 3-pure.de.sitter ] ) , the number of species @xmath15 is evaluated as @xmath126 let us , for example , choose @xmath40 and @xmath22 in ( [ 3-einstein.eq ] ) as @xmath127 } , \nonumber \\      & m=10^{16}\text { [ gev ] } ,       \label{3-scales}\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath114 is the string scale . in the case of @xmath128 , in which we do not make an additional finite renormalization to the minimal subtraction , the solution ( [ 3-einstein.eq-begin-solution ] ) becomes @xmath129 if @xmath130 satisfies @xmath131 the duration of the inflation becomes @xmath132 i.e. the e - folding number exceeds @xmath133 . in fig .

The authors propose a solution to these problems by considering the concept of exponential expansion called inflation.

The text begins by introducing the concept of inflation, which is a theory that proposes that the universe underwent a rapid expansion in the very early stages of its evolution","it is shown that the inflationary era in early universe is realized due to the effect of backreaction of quantized matter fields . 
 in fact we start by quantizing a free scalar field in the friedmann - robertson - walker space - time , and the field is fluctuating quantum mechanically around the bottom of the mass potential . 
 we then obtain the vacuum expectation value of the energy density of the scalar field as a functional of the scale factor @xmath0 of the universe . by plugging it into the einstein equation 
 , a self - consistent equation is established in which the matter fields determine the time evolution of the universe . 
 we solve this equation by setting few conditions and find the following solution : the universe expands  la de sitter with e - folding number @xmath1 and then it turns to shrink with a decreasing hubble parameter @xmath2 which rapidly goes to zero .    * a new mechanism of realizing inflationary universe + * with recourse to backreaction of quantized free fields +  inflation without inflaton  + * *    yoshinobu habara@xmath3 , hikaru kawai@xmath4 and masao ninomiya@xmath5    @xmath5okayama institute for quantum physics , 1 - 9 - 1 kyoyama , okayama 700 - 0015 , japan    @xmath6department of physics , kyoto university , kyoto 606 - 8502 , japan     habara@yukawa.kyoto-u.ac.jp , + hkawai@gauge.scphys.kyoto-u.ac.jp , + msninomiya@gmail.com    pacs numbers : 04.62.+v , 98.80.cq , 11.25.-w , 11.25.mj , 98.80.qc    keywords : inflation , string theory , cosmic microwave background",41346,556,1532,52.16 seconds,1.05 MB,0.3006134969325153,0.04320987654320988,0.15950920245398773,0.790768563747406,medium
"the inflationary paradigm@xcite proposed around @xmath6 was a giant leap towards going beyond the standard model of big - bang cosmology . since then there has been a plethora of inflationary models and it is still increasing @xcite . however , with the high precision observational cosmology @xcite , any cosmological model building will have to take care of strong observational constraints . by now inflation has become an integral part of the modern theoretical cosmology . it is an exponential expansion at the very early stage of our universe . so far this is the only mechanism which can successfully generate all the suitable initial boundary conditions for the standard big - bang cosmology . as mentioned before , there exists a large class of models which predict required inflationary observables within the experimental bounds . particularly , a recently discovered inflationary @xmath7 attractor @xcite gained a significant attentions because of its unification of a large class of models . in this paper we will introduce new classes of inflationary scenarios extending one of the present authors current work on minimal higgs inflation @xcite . in this class of models we consider a very simple modification of the usual power law potential by incorporating an inflation scale such that it generates a flat plateau for infinite range of inflaton field value . we may think of these form of the potentials as a small dip over a cosmological constant set by the aforementioned inflationary energy scale . therefore , it could be very generic in the sense that it does not need extreme fine - tunning to get such a form of the potential . only tunning we have to make is to model the form of the dip . however , we believe as well as our subsequent analysis shows that form of the dip will not have significant effect at least on the inflationary observables . it is the infinite flat plateau which plays the main role to trigger the inflation . depending upon the form of the dip , dynamics after the inflation or more specifically reheating prediction will be different . therefore , infinite class of models can be constructed by changing the form of the dip . in the recent paper on minimal higgs inflation @xcite , two different kind of form of the dip has been taken in compatible with the the usual higgs potential and found the models fit extremely well with the cosmological observations . in this paper we generalize further the form of the dip in compatible with the general power law potential and study in detail their predictions during inflation . we also study the evolution after the end of inflation , specifically focusing on reheating period . in this paper we mainly study the perturbative evolution of all the important components of the universe . out of all the components we specifically focus on the heavy dark matter production and constrain the parameter space based on the present dark matter abundance . the current observational data shows that most of the cold matters in our universe are non - baryonic @xcite , and weakly interacting @xcite . importantly , direct and indirect probe to detect dark matter in the lower mass range has been inconclusive so far . hence , it is quite natural to look for dark matter in the heavy mass range , where it is termed as the super - heavy dark matter@xcite . such a massive particle is very difficult to produce with the current experimental set up because of kinematics . however , reheating phenomena after the inflation is believed to be an important mechanism which can produce such a massive particle . therefore , in the cosmological context we can look for indirect evidence of such a heavy dark matter through small scale non - gaussianities in the cmb or even in ultra - high energy cosmic rays @xcite . the produced mass of the dark matter crucially depends on its production mechanism . for thermal production simple kinematics does not allow the production of dark matter with mass greater than equilibrium temperature@xmath8 . however , it has long been identified that during reheating , the equilibrium temperature @xmath9 is not the maximum temperature of the universe after inflation @xcite and as a consequence particles of mass larger than the reheating temperature can be produced@xcite . the mass limit can be further extended if we allow the dark matter production via direct decay of inflaton @xcite . in this paper we will generalize the existing mechanism of heavy dark matter production for arbitrary equation of state @xmath10 of the oscillating inflaton . we structured our paper as follows : in section - i , we introduce in detail the form of the potential and their behavior . we study inflationary dynamics and corresponding conditions for the inflation . all those conditions , which one generally calls slow roll parameters , will play important roll on the evolution of the cosmological perturbation . by using those we compute three important cosmological observables which are scalar spectral index @xmath11 , the tensor to scalar ratio @xmath12 , and the spectral running @xmath13 . we also considered the behavior of those parameters in terms of model parameter . after the end of inflation , generically the inflaton starts to have coherent oscillation at the minimum of the potential , which we call re - heating phase of the universe . without explicitly considering the detail mechanism of reheating , one can figure out the possible range of re - heating temperature @xmath8 , and constrain the evolution of scale factor parametrized by efolding number @xmath14 during re - heating period , by observing the background evolution of observable scales and entropy density . in section - ii , we will consider the aforementioned evolutions of scales and entropy density to constrain further our models . in section - iii , we study in detail the dynamics of the oscillatory phase of inflaton and study perturbative re - hearting phase . specifically focusing on the heavy dark matter particle production , we have solved a set of boltzmann equations for the coupled system of inflaton , radiation and the matter field with different inflaton equation of state during late time reheating phase . assuming the produced heavy particle to be a part of the total dark matter we see today , we set the upper limit on the value of dark matter annihilation cross - section with respect to the mass and reheating temperature . as we have mentioned in the introduction , we will model the dip part of the potential by the power law form . however , it has to have smooth connection with the flat infinite plateau as one increases the inflaton field value . therefore , we suggest the following simple forms of the potential , v ( ) =     + ,    in the above form of the potentials , we have introduced two free parameters @xmath15 . where , the parameter @xmath16 is defined for @xmath17 , which has been studied as minimal higgs inflation @xcite . for other value of @xmath2 , we can set @xmath18 . as has been advertised , we can think of above potentials as dip in the background of cosmological constants set by @xmath19 . a simple illustration of the above form of the potentials is shown the fig.[potential ] . through out the paper , we will refer type - i for first form of above potential and type - ii for the second form . of course one important generalization of our model can be done by considering the potential to be dependent only upon the modulus of the inflaton field . therefore , all the odd values of @xmath2 can be included . however , our analysis through out the paper will be valid for all values of @xmath2 . for the sake of simplicity we will stick to only even values of @xmath2 . another simple generalization of our model one can do is by defining @xmath20 as a new potential .    , for @xmath21      in this section we will study in detail the background dynamics using the above potential form . we will start with the following action , s  =   d^4x [ action ] where @xmath22 is the reduced planck mass . assuming the usual friedmann - robertson - walker(frw ) background ansatz for the space - time ds^2 = dt^2 - a(t)^2 ( dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2 ) , [ frw ] the system of equations governing the inflationary dynamics in the above background and the dynamics of the scalar field are 3m_p^2 h^2= ^2 + v ( ) + 2m_p^2 = -^2 + + 3 h + v ( ) . [ friedman ] where , the usual definition of hubble constant is @xmath23 . as we have seen , our potential has a very flat plateau away from the dip . therefore , flatness condition which is required for the inflationary dynamics is automatically satisfied for our potential . the flatness conditions for the potential during inflation are called slow - roll parameters , which are defied as ( ) ^2 & = &     +     + m_p^2 ( ) & = &     +    [ eq - slow - roll ] inflation occurs when @xmath24 and @xmath25 . as one can easily see , the inflation should end near the dip of the potential . however , the precise location of the end of inflation is usually set by the condition @xmath26 . let us also define a higher order slow - roll parameter related to the third derivative of the potential for our later purpose . the expression for the higher order slow - roll parameter is as follows : m_p^4 ( ) =     +    in addition to provide the successful inflation , we will see how all the aforementioned slow - roll parameters control the dynamics of cosmological perturbation in the inflationary background . the idea of inflation was first to solve the so - called horizon and flatness problem in the standard big bang cosmology . an important cosmological parameter which quantify the amount of inflation is called e - folding number @xmath27 . the e - folding number which is defined as the logarithmic ratio of the scale factors at the beginning and at the end of inflation , can be written as n = ln ( ) = _ a_in^a_end d lna = _ t_in^t_end h dt [ efold ] in the slow - roll regime one can use hdt = = [ efold2 ] as we have mentioned the inflation ends when @xmath26 , and one can use the eq.([efold ] ) to find the beginning of the inflation . now by using the eqs.([efold]-[efold2 ] ) , we can express the the efolding number into the following form , @xmath28 &   \simeq \frac{\phi_*^2}{n m_p^2 } \frac{1}{(n+2 ) } \tilde{\phi}^{(n+2 ) } \\ \frac{\phi_*^2}{n m_p^2 } \left[\frac{1}{4 } ( \tilde{\phi}^4-\phi_{end}^4 ) + \frac{1}{2 } ( \tilde{\phi}^2-\phi_{end}^2)\right ] & \simeq \frac{\phi_*^2}{4 n m_p^2 } \tilde{\phi}^4 ,         \end{cases }         \label{efold3}\ ] ] where we have defined , @xmath29 . in the right hand side of the above approximate expression for @xmath30 , we have ignored the contribution coming from @xmath31 , and also squared term . we have numerically checked the validity of those expressions for a wide range of value of @xmath32 of cosmological interest . from the observational constraint one needs @xmath33 in order to make the largest scales observed in cmb to be in causal contact before the inflation . we have all the necessary mathematical expressions to solve for the background inflationary dynamics . one particular solution has been given in fig.[mi - rhovaplot ] , with a specific value of the efolding number . once we solve for the background , in the next sections we will do cosmological perturbation analysis , and derive the relevant cosmological parameters as has been described in the introduction .      as we have explained in detail in the introduction , the very idea of inflation was devised to solve some outstanding problems of standard big - bang cosmology . soon it was realized that inflation also provides seed for large - scale structure formation via quantum fluctuation on the inflationary background . this remarkable fact gives the inflationary theory a solid basis . all the cosmologically relevant inflationary observables are essentially identified with various correlation function of those primordial fluctuations calculated in the framework of quantum field theory . in cosmological perturbation theory the most general form the perturbations on the inflationary background eq.([frw ] ) can be expressed as ( x , t ) & = & _ 0(t ) + ( x , t ) , + ds^2 & = & ( 1 + 2 ) dt^2 + 2 a ( _ i b + b_i)dx_i dt + a^2(1 - 2)_ij dx_i dx_j + & + & ( 2 _ i _ j e + 2 _ ( ie_j ) + h_ij)dx_i dx_j , where , the perturbed fields satisfy the following transverse and traceless gauge conditions , _ i h^ij = 0  ;  _ ij h^ij = 0  ;  ^i b_i = ^i e_i=0 . therefore , we have ten metric perturbation components , however , only two of them will be dynamical because of general coordinate invariance . those two are the component of tensor metric perturbation @xmath35 , which are gauge invariant . in addition we have one scalar degrees of freedom which is the inflaton field . by using the diffeomorphism invariance , one can identify the gauge invariant scalar perturbation @xcite : - . in the literature , we call it as co - moving curvature perturbation . two point correlation function of this curvature perturbation is known as primordial power spectrum . this is the fluctuation which turned into density perturbation after their horizon exit , and produce all large scale structure that we see through the gravitational instability after their horizon re - entry . in order to compute the correlation function , necessary quadratic action for curvature perturbation will look like , s_(2 ) = d^4 x a^3 . evaluating the power spectrum from this action is standard ( see , @xcite for a comprehensive review of cosmological perturbation theory ) , and it is given by = |_k = ah = . once , we know the power spectrum , cosmological quantity of our interests are the spectral tilt and its running . during inflation a particular inflaton field value corresponds to a particular momentum mode exiting the horizon . hence by using the following relation to the leading order in slow - roll parameters , @xmath36 , one obtains the following inflationary observables , n_s-1 = -6 + 2 dn_s^k = -2 + 16 - 24 ^2 . in a similar manner , we can also compute quadratic action for the gauge invariant tenor perturbation @xmath35 and compute its power spectrum @xmath37 . standard practice is to define a the tensor - to - scalar ratio r = = 16once we have all the expression for cosmological quantities in terms of slow roll parameters , by using eqs.([eq - slow - roll],[efold3 ] ) , and considering @xmath38 in unit of @xmath39 , we express @xmath34 in terms of @xmath2,@xmath30 and @xmath40 , as 1 - n_s & = &     +    ;  dn_s^k =    - + -     + r & = &    8n^2 ( ) ^ +    [ ns - r - r ] we have also numerically checked all the above approximate expressions . from the above analytic expressions for the @xmath34 , some general but important comments are as follows . for type - ii class of models , we see that the value of @xmath41 are insensitive to the value of @xmath2 or on the dimension of the potential . this fact can also bee seen from the fig.([fig - rvlogalpha ] ) , where , no approximation has been done . in particular one notices that for @xmath42 , value of @xmath43 start to deviate form each other for different value of @xmath2 . however , in general value of @xmath44 to the leading order . therefore , form the planck observation considering the upper bound of @xmath45 , we can constrain the upper limit of @xmath2 for a fixed value of @xmath32 . as one understands from this fact that from the current observation , it is difficult to uniquely fix the form of the potential . therefore , we need more theoretical inputs to figure out the full form of the potential . for type - i models , all quantities are dependent on @xmath2 , which can also be seen from fig.([fig - nsvlogalpha ] ) . however , an important fact emerges in the limit @xmath46 for these type of models . if we take the aforementioned limit , the expression of @xmath47 for the type - i model reduce to 1-n_s ;   r 8 ( ) ^2  ;  dn_s^k = - , which can be identified as a particular model within the class of recently proposed ` @xmath7-attractor ' models @xcite . therefore , for a wide range of parameter values , we have infinite possibilities namely for @xmath48 , which predict all the cosmological parameters within the planck bound @xcite . therefore , it is of particular importance to study their uv completion , specifically the supergravity formulation of those form of the potential . nonetheless , we have numerically checked the dependence of @xmath49 on @xmath2 for a particular value of inflationary scale as shown in fig.([fig - nsvn ] ) . as on observes , from eq.([ns - r - r ] ) , for @xmath50 , @xmath51 as @xmath46 . this is also clearly seen from the asymptotic behavior of @xmath49 in the fig.([fig - nsvn ] ) + .the spectral quantities for different values of @xmath2 for 50 efolding . the two values of @xmath40 are chosen to illustrate that we can have both small field and large field inflation depending on the value of @xmath40 . the general trend for the variation of these quantities with @xmath40 is illustrated in the figures ( [ fig - nsvlogalpha]-[fig - rvlogalpha ] ) [ cols= "" < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < "" , ]      +      in order to understand the the dynamics of all the component during reheating , we will first numerically solve boltzmann equation for a particular choice of parameter values . as we have seen from the reheating analysis , depending upon the equation of state , and within the experimental limit of the scalar spectral index , reheating temperature could be from @xmath52 gev all the way up to @xmath53 gev . therefore , we assume , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , which would result in @xmath57 , the value of @xmath58 can be found from the relation ( [ tre ] ) . we have taken @xmath59 at some arbitrary time during oscillatory period . with these choice of parameters the results are shown in the figure.([fig - particle1 ] ) . as we noted that the reheating temperature is not the maximum temperature in the radiation era and the maximum temperature is reached before the radiation domination begins . in our numerical calculation , we have checked that for reheating temperature @xmath60 the maximum temperature @xmath61 gev and similarly for @xmath62 , @xmath63 . the value of maximum temperature decreases slightly as we increase the value of @xmath2 . we have mentioned two possible ways of producing the @xmath64 particle . we see that changing @xmath65 and keeping @xmath9 fixed , the particle production get enhanced due to the direct production @xmath66 . this effect is evident from the presence of a second plateau in the curves for the evolution of x - particle energy density ( dotted line for @xmath67 and dot - dashed line for @xmath68 ) . even , for reheating temperature lower than @xmath69gev , the production via radiation is negligible and the direct production is the predominant one . we also note that the difference between the two production processes became lesser prominent as we increase @xmath0 . another important point we must mention is that , in deriving the analytic estimate for @xmath70 , we have assumed @xmath71 , in our numerical calculations we have checked the validity for the assumption for all the values of @xmath0 . the numerical values of the quantities for different values of @xmath2 are given in the table ( [ xtable ] ) . it is clear from the table-([xtable ] ) that the production of the dark matter particle decreases as we increase @xmath2 . it is also observed that for @xmath72 , we will not have radiation dominated universe after the reheating phase for @xmath73 gev . we arrived at this conclusion for a specific set of parameter values . therefore , we ask the question of what should be the allowed parameter region for a specific reheating temperature so that our stable heavy x - dark matter particle freezes out at a value such that after evolution it provides us the lower or equal to the dark matter abundance we see today . therefore , we have scan the parameter space of the dark matter annihilation cross section @xmath4 and its mass @xmath74 for a fixed reheating temperature taking reference of the current dark matter abundance . to put a bound we will use second form of eq.([abundance ] ) and this will enable us to write a relation between @xmath75 , @xmath74 and @xmath76 . the full relation is quite complicated , however we can simply write the relation between the three quantities of importance as follows , @xmath77~ \text{for $ m_x \lesssim t_{max}$}\\ \omega_x h^2 & = & d(w ) \left<\sigma|v|\right > m_x^4 exp\left[-\frac{e(w)m_x}{t_{max}}\right]~ \text{for $ m_x \gtrsim t_{max}$ } \label{analytic}\end{aligned}\ ] ] where , @xmath78 and @xmath79 are constants dependent on the equation of state parameter and the reheating parameters such as @xmath80 . according to the various cosmological observation , the dark matter abundance is measured as @xmath81 @xcite . therefore , if we consider this value as an upper limit for our x - particle abundance eq.([analytic ] ) , depending upon different equation of state parameter @xmath0 , we figure out the possible allowed region in fig.([fig - particle1 ] ) . the upper limit on annihilation cross - section @xmath82 is bounded by the red and blue lines coming from unitarity and @xmath83 respectively . the shaded region is allowed . as one observes from the plots , if we consider x - particle is the only dark matter candidate , the parameter space is highly constrained by the unitarity limit . for example , if we consider reheating temperature @xmath84 gev , production of super - heavy dark matter @xmath85 will not be allowed , mainly because of unitarity limit . as we increase @xmath9 , because of exponentially suppressed production , very narrow range of @xmath74 is allowed for super - heavy x - particle . for a fixed value of dark matter mass @xmath74 , as one increases @xmath0 , the upper bound on @xmath86 will decrease . as an example , for @xmath84 gev and @xmath87 gev , one finds @xmath88 for equation of state @xmath89 respectively . from fig.[fig - particle1 ] , as one increases the value of @xmath0 , in the low mass regime slope of the solid and dotted blue curves is decreasing . this fact widens the range of possible dark matter mass range while narrows down the annihilation cross - section . in the first part of this paper , we have constructed two new classes of inflationary model with non - polynomial modification of the inflaton potential . interesting property of these class of potential is that they have infinitely large flat plateau with a dip at the center in the field space . naturally the large flat plateau drives the inflation . as a result , the predictions of the models are not very much sensitive to the details of the dip and more importantly fit extremely well with latest cosmological observation made by planck . all the necessary scales in our models are below planck scale , which may imply that our model predictions are robust and any high energy correction to the observables could be planck scale suppressed . detailed computation on the ultra - violate effect on our model could be important and we left it for our future work . depending upon the choice of scale , our model can have both large field as well as small field inflation . however , for both the cases with a wide range of scale , the prediction of tensor to scalar ratio @xmath12 turned out to be significantly small . another important aspect of our model is that we can have significantly low inflationary hubble scale @xmath90 unlike the prediction of usual power law inflationary model . the value could be as low as @xmath91 gev for different values of @xmath92 for @xmath93 . as we had discussed , low value fo @xmath90 could be interesting in the context of higgs vacuum instability . as has been pointed out in @xcite , during as well as after the inflation the quantum fluctuation of higgs field can destabilize the standard model metastable higgs vacuum at around @xmath94 gev . however , this instability crucially depends upon the value of @xmath90 , and also the height of the higgs potential . therefore , comparing the naive scale dependence between @xmath95 and @xmath96 , our model have potential to save the higgs vacuum from decaying into the global vacuum . we leave detail study for our future work .    since we have discussed about the possible interesting interplay between our model and the higgs field at high energy scale , it would be of particular interest to understand the potential application of our model in the particle physics context . this is what motivates us to study the possible connection and constraints of our models specifically in the context of heavy dark matter production during the reheating period . after the end of inflation , reheating is the stage during which all the matter fields are produced . usual strategy is to consider the effective coupling among inflaton and various other matter fields we see today . in this paper we have specifically concentrated on the perturbative reheating phenomena . near the origin the inflaton potential behaves like a power law @xmath97 , therefore , coherently oscillating inflaton can be well approximated as an effective fluid with the equation of state parameter , @xmath98 . with the usual pure power law potential , one finds it very difficult to fit the cosmological observation for even @xmath99 . therefore , detailed study have not been done for general power law potential specifically in the context of reheating . however , as we have advertised through out our paper , with the non - polynomial generalization we can easily have power law form of the inflaton potential specifically at the bottom of the dip where the inflaton coherently oscillates . this fact leads us to generalize the known analysis of the perturbative reheating @xcite for general effective inflaton equation of state @xmath0 . hence , we first tried to analytically study the boltzmann equations for the evolution of inflaton , radiation and a massive dark matter field for generic @xmath0 . furthermore , we compared our analytic study with the full numerical solutions for specific form of the potential of our interest . we have found some interesting behavior such as the existence of minimum extraction of energy from the inflaton field for @xmath100 . it could be interesting to understand this fact better and constrain the reheating period if any . however , our main focus was to study the production of heavy dark matter particle with mass @xmath101 . as there is no observational evidence of light dark matter so far , the heavy dark matter phenomenology could be interesting to explore@xcite . the reheating mechanism is not fully explored and ill understood because of its non - linearity . however it is assumed to have huge potential to explain many particle physics as well as cosmological problems starting from baryogenesis , dark matter , neutrino mass and their properties . however , in this paper we concentrated on heavy dark matter production . we constrained the dark matter annihilation cross - section ( @xmath102 ) as a function of its mass @xmath74 considering the present dark matter abundance @xmath103 as an upper limit . if we consider single component dark matter , parameter space is tightly constrained . for example , if one considers low reheating temperature such as @xmath104 gev , we can not have production of super - heavy dark matter of mass @xmath105 gev . as we increase the equation of state @xmath0 , the region of parameter space is shrinks . it would interesting study in details these link between the equation of state of the inflaton and the heavy dark matter particle . planck collaboration , p. a. r. ade et al.,planck 2013 results . constraints on inflation , astron . * 571 * ( 2014 ) a22 , [ arxiv:1303.5082 [ astro-ph.co ] ] , planck 2015 results . constraints on inflation , astron . astrophys . * 594 * , a20 ( 2016 ) , [ arxiv:1502.02114 [ astro-ph.co ] ] . r. kallosh and a. linde , jcap * 1307 * , 002 ( 2013 ) [ arxiv:1306.5220 [ hep -

"galaxy - galaxy gravitational lensing is a powerful astrophysical tool for studying the distribution of matter , including dark matter , in galaxies @xcite . one promising application of lensing is to study and measure the properties of dark matter substructures in the lens galaxy @xcite . in recent years , this promise has been realised in several lens systems which are thought to contain at least one dark substructure @xcite . in these studies , the lens was modelled as a superposition of a smooth component ( such as an elliptical power - law matter distribution ) plus a pixellized `` non - parametric '' correction term . the estimated spatial structure of the correction term provides clues about the locations of possible substructures . in a second modelling step , the lens is assumed to be a smooth overall component plus a compact `` blob '' near any locations suggested by the correction term . this kind of inference has also been done with point - like multiple images of quasars @xcite .    in this paper , we introduce an approach for solving this same problem ( inferring the number and properties of dark substructures given an image ) in a more direct fashion , by fitting a model with an unknown number of substructures directly to the image data . however , with appropriate modifications , it may also prove useful in other galaxy - galaxy lens modelling areas . one example is time - delay cosmography , which requires realistically flexible lens models , and reliable quantification of the uncertainties @xcite . lens modelling has been a topic of much interest over the last two decades . most approaches are based on bayesian inference @xcite , maximum likelihood @xcite or variations thereof . these approaches may be categorized according to the following criteria :    1 .   whether to use a simply parameterized ( e.g. a srsic profile ) , moderately flexible ( e.g. a mixture model , * ? ? ? * ) or free - form ( e.g. pixellated ) model for the surface brightness profile of the source ; 2 .   whether to use a simply parameterized ( e.g. singular isothermal ellipsoid [ sie ] ) or flexible model ( e.g. pixellated ) for the mass profile of the lens ; and 3 . how to compute the results ( e.g. optimization methods , markov chain monte carlo [ mcmc ] with source parameters marginalized out analytically , or mcmc with the source parameters included ) . recent sophisicated approaches investigating different prior assumptions and computational approaches include @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . each approach involves tradeoffs between convenience and realism . simply parameterized models , such as srsic surface brightness profiles for the source , and singular isothermal ellipsoid plus external shear ( sie+@xmath0 ) models for the lens , are very convenient . they only have a few adjustable parameters , and they capture ( to `` first order '' ) relevant prior information that we have about the source and lens profiles . of course , they are clearly simplifications , and can produce misleading results if the actual profile is very different from any member of the assumed family . on the other hand , pixellated models for the source ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or the lens ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) can in principle represent `` any '' source surface brightness profile or lens projected density profile . however , the prior distribution over pixel values is often chosen to be a multivariate gaussian for mathematical reasons , so that the source can be analytically marginalized out @xcite . unfortunately , a multivariate gaussian prior over pixel intensities usually corresponds to a poor model of our prior beliefs about the source . it assigns virtually zero prior probability to the hypothesis that the source actually looks like a galaxy , and very high prior probability to the hypothesis that the source looks like noise ( or blurred noise ) . these priors also assign nonzero probability to negative surface brightness or density values ; in fact , the marginal prior probability that any pixel is negative is typically 0.5 . @xcite argued that an ideal modelling approach lies somewhere between simply - parameterised and pixellated models , which is also a motivation behind the investigation of shapelets by @xcite . one way of achieving this is with mixture models . the source and the lens can be built up from a mixture of a moderate number ( from a few to a few hundred ) of simply parameterised components . for the source , this allows us to incorporate prior knowledge about the local correlations ( the surface brightness at any particular point is likely to be similar to that at a nearby point ) and the fact that most of the sky is dark @xcite . the @xcite model also allowed for multi - band data , and allowed for our expectation that the image may or may not be similar in different bands . the present paper is similar in approach to @xcite . the main differences are : i ) we use a simpler and faster set of basis functions ; ii ) we apply it to the lens as well as the source , allowing for the possibility of substructure ; and iii ) the implementation is based on a c++ template library developed by @xcite which allows for hierarchical priors and trans - dimensional mcmc to be implemented in a relatively straightforward manner . however , in the present paper we do not account for multi - band data ; this will be reserved for a future contribution . the source code for this project is available at http://www.github.com/eggplantbren/lensing2 . if we are interested in detecting and measuring the properties of possible dark substructures in a lens galaxy , a superposition of an unknown number of `` blobs '' is the most natural model . in addition , if we want to constrain the mass function of these blobs ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , we will need a hierarchical model which specifies the prior probability distribution for the masses conditional on some hyperparameters . inferring the mass function of the blobs then reduces to calculating the posterior distribution for the hyperparameters . this is related to the general principle that we should ( ideally ) construct our inference methods so that the quantities we infer directly answer our scientific questions @xcite . here , we are referring to the mass function of the substructures within a single lens galaxy . an additional level of hierarchy would be needed to answer questions about a sample of lens galaxies . we now describe the details of our model and its parameterization . the motivation for most of our modelling choices is a compromise between computational efficiency , realism , and ease of implementation . none of the choices we have made are final in any sense ; rather , this model should be considered a proof of concept . we encourage exploration of other choices . since we can compute marginal likelihoods , bayesian model comparison between our choices here and any proposed alternatives should be straightforward , if a union of our hypothesis space and another can be considered a reasonable model of prior uncertainty . the surface brightness profile of the source is assumed to be composed of a sum of a finite number of `` blobs '' , or basis functions , in order to allow some flexibility while incorporating prior information about the non - negativity of surface brightness , and the spatial correlation expected in real surface brightness profiles . for computational speed , we choose the following functional form for the surface brightness profile of a single blob centered at the origin : @xmath1 where @xmath2 , @xmath3 is the width of the blob , and @xmath4 is the total flux of the blob ( i.e. the integral of the surface brightness over the entire domain ) . these basis functions are inverted paraboloids , which are faster to evaluate than gaussians , since they do not contain an exponential function . in addition , the finite support means that each blob will evaluate to zero over a large fraction of the domain which confers an additional speed advantage . more conventional choices such as gaussians are possible , as are alternative compact basis functions , perhaps inspired by the smoothed particle hydrodynamics literature @xcite . alternative choices , such as srsic profiles , may be more realistic despite their computational cost . this is especially likely in the case of an early - type source galaxy ( e.g. * ? ? ? such modifications are possible without great effort using the rjobject library , and once implemented , the marginal likelihood can be compared across different choices for the source model . if our model contains @xmath5 such blobs , positioned at @xmath6 with widths @xmath7 and total fluxes @xmath8 , the overall surface brightness profile is : @xmath9 where @xmath10 . under these assumptions , the source can be described in its entirety by the following parameters : @xmath11 where @xmath12 denotes the parameters for source blob @xmath13 : @xmath14 the dimensionality of the parameter space for the source depends on the minimum and maximum values of @xmath5 , which we set to 0 and 100 respectively ( more detail about priors is given in section  [ sec : priors ] ) . therefore the source is described by 1  401 parameters . the surface mass density profile of the lens is modelled as a superposition of a singular isothermal ellipsoid plus external shear ( sie+@xmath0 ) and @xmath15 circular lens `` blobs '' . the sie+@xmath0 is a simple and widely used lens model with analytically available deflection angles , and is intended to account for the bulk of the lensing effect due to the smooth spatial distribution of ( visible and dark ) matter in the lens galaxy . unfortunately , along with simplicity comes a lack of realism , and generalising the smooth lens model is an important future step . the softened power law elliptical mass density or spemd model is a popular generalization of the sie where the deflection angles can still be computed quickly using the approximations given by @xcite . ultimately , concentric mixtures of smooth components may be the most useful for realistic inference of the density profile of the halo . a common approach in the lensing community , that is similar in spirit , is a superposition of an elliptical power law , external shear , and a pixellated potential correction . however , the direct use of blobs is closer to the scientific question at hand when investigating postential dark substructures . the sie+@xmath0 has nine free parameters : the ( circularized ) einstein radius @xmath16 , axis ratio @xmath17 , central position @xmath18 , orientation angle @xmath19 , the external shear @xmath0 , and the orientation angle of the external shear , @xmath20 . the @xmath15 lens blobs are intended to model possible dark or faint substructures in the projected mass profile of the lens . a lensing blob with mass @xmath21 and width @xmath22 centered at the origin has the following surface mass density profile : @xmath23 which is the same as the surface brightness profile of a source blob . the deflection angles for a single blob are : @xmath24 where @xmath25 . these do not depend on any computationally expensive functions such as square roots or exponentials . for @xmath15 such blobs the deflection angles are summed over all blobs . therefore the lens can be entirely described by the following parameters :    @xmath26    where @xmath27 denotes the parameters for lens blob @xmath13 : @xmath28 and @xmath29 describes the parameters for the sie+@xmath0 component : @xmath30    since the model is not of fixed dimension ( the number of source and lens `` blobs '' is unknown ) , we used a trans - dimensional mcmc sampler based on reversible jump mcmc @xcite . this framework has been used successfully in many astronomical inference problems ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? we implemented the mcmc using the rjobject software @xcite , a c++ library for implementing trans - dimensional mcmc with hierarchically - specified priors when the model is a `` mixture model '' or similar , as is the case here . the rjobject library uses the diffusive nested sampling algorithm ( dns ; * ? ? ? * ) for its sampling , but the trans - dimensionality is handled by the mcmc moves . therefore , the marginal likelihood we obtain is one that involves a sum over the hypothesis space for @xmath5 and @xmath31 . in other words , we do not need separate runs with different trial values of @xmath5 and @xmath31 . previous astronomical applications of rjobject include @xcite and  @xcite . proposal moves for the parameters ( positions and masses of the source and lens blobs ) , and birth / death moves to add or remove blobs to the source or lens , are handled internally by rjobject and fit into the general framework described in @xcite . the prior probability distributions for all hyperparameters , parameters , and the data , are given in table  [ tab : priors ] , and a factorization of the joint distribution is displayed in figure  [ fig : pgm ] . with these priors , we aim to express a large degree of prior uncertainty ( hence the liberal use of uniform , log - uniform , and cauchy distributions ) . however , we also specify some priors hierarchically to allow ( for example ) blobs to cluster around a typical central position , rather than implying a high probability for substructure positions being spread uniformly ( in a frequency sense ) over the sky . we also applied hierarchical priors to the substructure masses ( and source fluxes ) so that , while the typical order of magnitude of the masses is unknown , the masses themselves are likely to be roughly the same order of magnitude . the hyperparameters of these distributions can also be interpreted as straightforward answers to questions about the substructure mass function .    [ cols=""<,<,<"",options=""header "" , ]     we assign somewhat informative ( but heavy - tailed ) cauchy priors to the central positions of the source and the lens . one might object to the cauchy priors for the central positions ( and argue instead for gaussians ) on the basis that they do not have rotational symmetry . however , the priors we are assigning are prior only to the values of the data pixel intensities only , and not other facts about the data , such as its dimensions in arc seconds , or its rectangular shape . given these , there is no reason to insist on rotational symmetry . the cauchy priors are intended to enhance the plausibility ( relative to what a uniform prior would imply ) that the lens and source are somewhere near the centre of the image , but in a cautious way . the `` circular '' conditional prior for the blob positions has the following density : @xmath32 where @xmath33 . this results from an exponential distribution ( with expectation @xmath34 ) for the radial coordinate and a uniform distribution for the angular coordinate in plane polar coordinates . this was chosen ( as opposed to a more `` obvious '' choice such as a normal distribution ) for computational reasons : the rjobject code requires a function to transform from uniform(0 , 1 ) distributions to this distribution and back ( making use of cumulative distribution functions and their inverses ) , and the normal would have required the use of special functions for this .          the conditional prior for the data given the parameters is a product of independent gaussian distributions , one for each pixel . the mean of the gaussian is given by the `` mock '' noise - free image we would expect based on the parameters . the standard deviation of the gaussian is a combination of three terms ; the first ( denoted @xmath35 ) is a `` noise map '' which is loaded from a file , the second is an unknown constant @xmath36 which applies to the whole image , and the third is proportional to the square root of the mock image , with proportionality constant @xmath37 . this is usually called the `` sampling distribution '' , or sometimes just the `` likelihood '' . however , sampling distribution is misleading since no physical frequency distribution exists which is being sampled from . the term likelihood is also usually used to refer to the scalar function of the parameters obtained when the data are known . for a discussion of the view that this object is really a prior distribution , see @xcite . it is common to provide a `` variance image '' to lens modelling software , which specifies the standard deviations used in the likelihood function . however , telescopes do not provide variance images . it also does not make sense to specify vague priors prior to the image pixel values but posterior to the variance image ( which usually resembles the image itself , and therefore would be highly informative ) . allowing the standard deviation of the gaussian in the likelihood to depend on the mock image brightness is a more principled way of modelling our actual inferential situation . nevertheless , we allow for an input variance image as well , which can be used for ad - hoc masking of troublesome regions ( such as unmodelled flux from other sources ) . computing the posterior distribution over the parameters of such a model requires that we can implement markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) over the space of possible sources and lenses . to compute the posterior distribution for the parameters ( of which there are 24464 , depending on the values of @xmath5 and @xmath31 ) , we use diffusive nested sampling @xcite , a form of nested sampling @xcite that uses the metropolis algorithm to move around the parameter space . the proposal distributions for the blob parameters ( both source and lens ) are handled by the rjobject library @xcite . this includes birth and death proposals that increase or decrease either @xmath5 , or @xmath31 , as well as proposals that move the blobs ( in their parameter space ) while keeping the number of blobs fixed . rjobject also facilitates proposals that change the hyperparameters ( either for the lens or the source ) while keeping the actual blobs in place , as well as proposals that change the hyperparameters and shift all of the relevant blobs in so they are appropriate for the new values of the hyperparameters . evaluating the likelihood function requires that we compute a `` mock '' image from the current setting of the parameters . this mock image is calculated using standard ray - tracing methods with a uniform grid of @xmath38 rays fired per image pixel . however , certain kinds of proposals do not affect the image in any way , such as those which change the noise parameters . for efficiency we do not recompute the mock image in these cases . to demonstrate the method , we generated a simulated dataset where the lens was an sie@xmath39 profile with a single additional substructure . the image is shown in figure  [ fig : image1 ] , and consists of 100 @xmath40 100 pixels . the point spread function ( psf ) was compact and was defined on a 5 @xmath40 5 grid . the data was created by firing only one ray per pixel , and the inference was also carried out under the same level of approximation . since the model assumptions are all correct for this image , the demonstration here is purely to illustrate the computational tractability of the problem , and the kind of outputs the method can produce . the sie@xmath39 parameters were , to three significant figures , @xmath41 , where the length units in the image plane are arbitrary , and rotation angles are measured in radians . the single substructure is located at @xmath42 , about halfway between the center and the upper left image . its mass is 2.50 units , using the convention where the critical density is 1 . for comparison , the sie mass within its critical ellipse is @xmath43 units . lens close to the center of the image , indicated by the white circle , plus a single substructure close to the top left image ( indicated by a star symbol ) . the image was blurred by a psf and had some noise added . in an arbitrary system of units , this image extends from -8 to 8 in the @xmath44 and @xmath45 directions.[fig : image1 ] ]    we executed the code to generate 5,000 samples from the `` mixture of constrained priors '' distribution of dns . our thinning factor was @xmath46 , so @xmath47 mcmc iterations were actually performed , taking approximately 48 hours on a modest desktop pc . after resampling these samples to reflect the posterior distribution , we were left with 500 ( equally weighted ) posterior samples . the posterior distributions for complex models , such as the mixture models used here , are often challenging and unintuitive to summarise . one effective way to visualise the uncertainty in the inferences is to play a movie where each frame is a sample from the posterior distribution . the degree to which the frames differ from each other conveys the uncertainty remaining after taking the data into account .    for the purposes of a paper , static summaries are more convenient than movies . one useful summary is based on the concept of empirical measure . the _ empirical measure _ of the substructure positions is a function that takes the actual substructure positions @xmath48 and produces a `` density function '' over two dimensions , composed of delta functions at the positions themselves : @xmath49    intuitively , the empirical measure is a mathematical object that is like an `` infinite resolution histogram '' , in this case a two dimensional histogram , of the substructure positions . being a function of the actual substructure positions , the empirical measure is not available to us since we do not know those positions with certainty . however , we have samples from the posterior distribution for those positions , and can use these ( trivially ) to create samples from the posterior distribution for the empirical measure . we can also summarise this posterior , for example , by taking its expected value . the posterior expected value of the empirical measure is : @xmath50 where @xmath51 denotes all parameters and hyperparameters ( including the @xmath15s ) and `` @xmath52 '' is an integral and summation over the entire parameter space . since we can approximate posterior expectations using monte carlo , we can obtain the expected value of the empirical measure using : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the number of posterior samples . the resulting function is an `` image '' with a point mass wherever a substructure occurred . for visualisation purposes the image can be blurred , or calculated at a lower resolution by replacing the dirac - delta function with a discrete version which returns a nonzero constant if a substructure appears in a pixel or zero otherwise . the masses of the smooth and substructure components of the lens are usually of interest . since the total mass of an sie lens is infinite , the question needs to be redefined , so we ask about the mass within some aperture of finite area . for an sie , the mass ( in dimensionless units based on the critical density ) within the critical ellipse is simply @xmath55 . however , the blobs have finite total masses @xmath56 . to obtain the posterior distribution for the lens masses , one must be clear about exactly which mass they are talking about , and many definitions are possible , although some might be more meaningful or well constrained than others . in the present paper we do not address the question of exactly which quantities related to the density profile of the lens are most scientifically interesting . nevertheless , we can verify that the results of the inference do behave in understandable ways . for example , in figure  [ fig : masses1 ] , we plot the joint posterior distribution for the sie mass within its critical ellipse and the total substructure mass over the entire domain . as one would expect , there is a strong dependence between these two quantities in the posterior distribution , as mass in the sie can be traded off with mass in substructures to some extent , while the model remains ( loosely speaking ) `` consistent with the data '' .    ] the posterior distribution for @xmath31 is also clearly of interest , and is displayed in figure  [ fig : n_lens1 ] . the prior for this parameter was uniform from 0 to 10 ( inclusive ) , and the possibility @xmath57 has been ( loosely speaking ) `` ruled out '' by the image data . the true solution ( @xmath58 ) has the highest probability . however , the possibilities with @xmath59 are still fairly plausible , since it s possible that a very small substructure exists , and it s also possible that two substructures near each other could mimic the effect of one . the degree to which these possibilities are plausible is related to the choice of prior for the blob amplitudes and positions .    , the number of substructures in the lens . the prior was uniform and the true value used to generate the data was 1 . however , the data is only informative enough to suppress the probability of values above 1 slightly , since it is possible ( given this data ) that low mass substructures might exist somewhere , or that what we think is one substructure might actually be two close together , and other such possibilities . [ fig : n_lens1 ] ]    the estimated marginal likelihood of our model ( averaged over all parameters including @xmath31 and @xmath5 ) is @xmath60 \approx -14141.4 $ ] , and the information ( kullback - leibler divergence from the prior to the posterior ) is @xmath61 nats . the information represents the degree of compression of the posterior distribution with respect to the prior , and can be interpreted quite literally as how much was learned about the parameters from the data . it is also straightforward to estimate from nested sampling @xcite . its definition is : @xmath62 \ , d\boldsymbol{\theta}\end{aligned}\ ] ] and we can build intuition about its meaning based on some simple examples . one such example is a uniform prior over a volume @xmath63 and a posterior which is uniform over a smaller volume @xmath64 contained within @xmath63 . in this case @xmath65 therefore , a value of @xmath66 nats implies the posterior distribution occupies roughly @xmath67 of the prior volume .    ]    for the sampled parameter values representing the posterior distribution , there was no structure in the residuals ( not shown ) , when normalised by the noise standard deviation in each pixel . this is unsurprising since the model assumptions are entirely correct for this dataset . to further test the algorithm , we created a `` harder '' simulated image , where the lens consisted of an sie+@xmath0 profile plus 10 additional substructures . the image is shown in figure  [ fig : image2 ] . with the easy dataset , there was little hope of measuring the substructure mass function parameter @xmath68 since there was only a single substructure which would provide little information about @xmath68 ( only constraining its general order of magnitude ) , even if its mass were measured perfectly . ( whose centre is indicated by a white circle ) and ten substructures . only five of the substructures ( star symbols ) occured within the square image boundary , but the other five still have an effect on the image . [ fig : image2 ] ]    as with the ` easy ' dataset , we generated 5,000 samples from the dns target distribution and thinned by a factor of @xmath46 , so @xmath47 mcmc iterations were actually performed , taking approximately 60 hours . the slower runtime in this case was because @xmath69 , more cpu time was spent exploring parts of the hypothesis space where @xmath31 is high . the run resulted in 557 equally - weighted posterior samples . the posterior distribution for the sie mass and the total substructure mass is given in figure  [ fig : masses2 ] . the samples can be viewed as a movie at www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3ppfksk248 .    , but for the ` harder ' simulated dataset . [ fig : masses2 ] ]    to demonstrate the claim that we can infer something about the mass function of substructures directly from the image data , we have plotted the posterior distribution for @xmath68 , the hyperparameter for the substructure masses , in figure  [ fig : mu_lens ] . the true value was 1 , and the posterior distribution indicates a fairly wide uncertainty range that is at least consistent with the true value in some sense . given that the image only contained a few substructures whose masses could be measured with any accuracy , the large uncertainty is not surprising .    , the hyperparameter which determines the prior expected value of substructure masses , given the ` harder ' simulated data . the true value ( in arbitrary units ) was 1 , which is indicated by the vertical line . [ fig : mu_lens ] ]    , but for the ` harder ' simulated dataset . the true number of substructures was 10 , which also happens to be the posterior mode . only five substructures were located within the domain of the image , but @xmath69 is probable because the spread - out positions of the substructures imply that @xmath70 is probably large . [ fig : n_lens2 ] ]    , but for the ` harder ' simulated dataset . for all of the substructures located close to the ring , the positions were well constrained . there was weak evidence for some substructures that did not in fact exist .

[ fig : masses3 ] ]    , but for the cosmic horseshoe . the posterior distribution for the number of lens substructures in the cosmic horseshoe system . there is moderate evidence in favour of the hypothesis that @xmath84.[fig : n_lens3 ] ]    despite weak evidence for the existence of substructure , when we examine the expected value of the empirical measure of substructure positions ( figure  [ fig : substructures3 ] ) we find no consistency in their positions , unlike for the simulated data ( figure  [ fig : substructures1 ] ) . this situation is not uncommon . for example , @xcite found evidence for a large number of keplerian signals in a time series , but the number of such signals with well constrained properties was much lower . related to this , we can compute posterior probabilities for any hypothesis about the substructure masses . with 95% probability the substructure mass is less than 1.53@xmath85 solar masses and with 75% probability it is less than 5.10@xmath86 solar masses . as the einstein ring itself implies a mass of about @xmath87 solar masses , these summaries are affected by the possibility of blobs outside the main einstein ring .    as with any inference , the results presented here may be sensitive to many of the input modelling assumptions , and a slightly different ( yet still reasonable ) set of choices might yield different results . for example , if the density profile of the lens was smooth but not of the sie form , and the data were informative enough to show this , the current model would only be able to explain the data by adding substructures . hence , an alternative explanation for these results is that , rather than containing a substructure , the density profile of the lens is simply not within the sie@xmath39 family . in fact , some of the posterior samples obtained contain massive substructures outside of the image , which could be modelling higher - order effects of the environment beyond what is captured by the simple external shear model . this is one way of violating the sie@xmath39 assumption , and another is simply to have a different projected density profile . one way of further investigating this is to use a different family of smooth lens models and doing model selection based on the marginal likelihoods . another option which we defer to future work is to implement a more flexible model ( such as a mixture of concentric elliptical lenses ) . this result is consistent with that of @xcite , who found a slight preference for an elliptical power law profile over the sie ( which is a specific case of an elliptical power law ) . another potential inadequacy of our model is the assumption that the psf is known . in practice , the psf is often estimated from the image of nearby star(s ) , or from theoretical knowledge of the telescope ( especially in the case of space based imaging ) . however , if the psf is misspecified , or in fact varies across the image , this could induce subtle effects in the imaging which our current model could only explain using substructure .    , but for the cosmic horseshoe . the positions of substructures encountered in the mcmc sampling for the cosmic horseshoe ; technically a monte carlo approximation to the posterior expected value of the empirical measure of substructure positions . unlike figure  [ fig : substructures1 ] , for the cosmic horseshoe there is little consistency in the positions of the substructures . [ fig : substructures3 ] ]    the estimated marginal likelihood of our model is @xmath60 \approx -6948.5 $ ] , and the information ( kullback - leibler divergence from the prior to the posterior ) is @xmath88 nats . three example models ( lens and source ) sampled from the posterior are shown in figure  [ fig : sources ] . the model was able to fit the data down to the noise level . the `` effective sample size '' returned by dns , which we have described as the number of posterior samples , takes into account the fact dns s target distribution is not the posterior . however , it does not take autocorrelation into account , and thus can present an optimistic picture of the accuracy of any monte carlo approximations to posterior quantities . most standard diagnostic techniques used in mcmc can be applied here . the simplest of these is a check of reproducibility . if different runs yield substantially different results , the mcmc output should be treated with caution . for example , in figure  [ fig : masses3 ] , there is a correlation between the mass attributed to the sie component and that attributed to substructures . however , the distribution also appears somewhat `` lumpy '' or multimodal . this may not be a feature of the actual posterior distribution , but could arise due to imperfect sampling . whereas a standard metropolis sampler would move around very slowly in the hypothesis space , dns naturally spends a non - negligible fraction of the time sampling the prior . therefore , a particle exploring the parameter space can `` forget '' its good - fitting position , move somewhere completely different , and find another good - fitting model in a different location . this is a natural feature of the algorithm ( and is also present in related algorithms such as parallel tempering ) . despite this , the patchy nature of figure  [ fig : masses3 ] suggests that posterior exploration is still challenging in this problem . the results for the simulated data ( figure  [ fig : masses1 ] ) were less complex because of the definite existence of one substructure . its mass and position provide some information about the hyperparameters @xmath89 , restricting the probability that high mass substructures exist far from the image . we have developed a trans - dimensional bayesian approach motivated directly by the question of whether dark substructures exist in a lens galaxy , given image data . by making use of the diffusive nested sampling algorithm @xcite and the rjobject library @xcite , we outsource the difficulties associated with choosing metropolis proposals for a hierarchical model of non - fixed dimension . the model allows for source and lens `` blobs '' to appear as needed to explain the data . the prior for the blobs properties is specified hierarchically , to more realistically model sensible prior beliefs , and to tie the model parameters directly to questions of scientific interest such as the mass function of substructures .    as a proof of concept , we demonstrated the successful recovery of a single substructure from simulated data for which all of the model assumptions were true . we then applied the method to an image of the cosmic horseshoe system and found moderate evidence in favour of the existence of a substructure , or at the very least , a departure from a simple sie+@xmath0 lens profile . the main output of our method is a set of posterior samples , each representing a plausible scenario for the lens and the source given the data and the assumed prior information . these samples can be displayed as a movie , which is a very useful method for intuitively understanding the remaining uncertainty . any posterior summaries of interest can be produced from the samples , but the interpretation of many of these summaries is not necessarily straightforward . we have suggested that the posterior expectation of the empirical measure of substructure positions is one of the most helpful summaries . the model assumptions used in this paper are fairly simple . in future work we intend to generalize the model to multi - band data , and extend the smooth lens model beyond the overly simplistic sie+@xmath0 assumption . applications to other systems are also forthcoming , as well as variants on the model using different conditional priors for the substructure properties given the hyperparameters . it is a pleasure to thank phil marshall ( stanford ) , tommaso treu ( ucla ) , ross fadely ( nyu ) , alan heavens ( edinburgh ) , and the referee for valuable discussion . thomas lumley ( auckland ) also deserves credit for ending bjb s usage of the jet colormap . this work was funded by a marsden fast start grant from the royal society of new zealand .","The text discusses a method for inferring the properties of dark matter substructures in galaxy lensing data. The method, called ""mixture of constrained priors,"" is a Bayesian approach that uses a combination of simple and flexible models to infer the properties of the substructures. The method is based on a hierarchical model that includes a smooth component and a pixellated component, and is parameterized by a set of hyperparameters.

The method is compared to other approaches, including Bayesian inference, maximum likelihood","we introduce a bayesian solution to the problem of inferring the density profile of strong gravitational lenses when the lens galaxy may contain multiple dark or faint substructures . 
 the source and lens models are based on a superposition of an unknown number of non - negative basis functions ( or `` blobs '' ) whose form was chosen with speed as a primary criterion . 
 the prior distribution for the blobs properties is specified hierarchically , so the mass function of substructures is a natural output of the method . 
 we use reversible jump markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) within diffusive nested sampling ( dns ) to sample the posterior distribution and evaluate the marginal likelihood of the model , including the summation over the unknown number of blobs in the source and the lens . 
 we demonstrate the method on two simulated data sets : one with a single substructure , and one with ten . 
 we also apply the method to the g - band image of the `` cosmic horseshoe '' system , and find evidence for more than zero substructures . however , these have large spatial extent and probably only point to misspecifications in the model ( such as the shape of the smooth lens component or the point spread function ) , which are difficult to guard against in full generality .

"the classical big - bang model based on einstein s general relativity does not explain the origin of the initial singularity , which is expected to be understood at a higher dimensional string theory model . it is known that the horava - witten theory @xcite relates 11-dimensional supergravity on the orbifold @xmath1 with strongly coupled heterotic @xmath2 string theory . then , this link suggests that as one probes higher energies , our 4-dimensional universe would first go through an intermediate regime where the orbifold dimension becomes visible , thus making our world appear 5-dimensional @xcite , and only at energies of order the string scale the universe would look 11-dimensional . the intermediate 5-dimensional energy regime has led to the conjecture that our universe is a brane in a higher dimensional world . these horava - witten inspired `` braneworlds '' have a topology defined by a line times a non - compact space with two branes at the boundaries of the line element , which is usually characterized as the orbifold @xmath1 . due to the compactness of the orbifold direction , one brane has positive tension while the other has the opposite negative one . by construction these spacetimes are supersymmetric and this unbroken supersymmetry of the static background solution guarantees the local stability of the model @xcite . however , the situation changes when the background solution becomes time - dependent . the idea of having moving branes has naturally led to the suggestion that the hot big bang is the result of a brane collision @xcite , or even that our universe undergoes an endless sequence of cosmic epochs which begins with a universe expanding from a big bang and ending with a contraction to a big crunch @xcite . colliding braneworld scenarios offer an alternative point of view for many long - standing problems and puzzles such as those connected with the existence of gravitational shortcuts ( apparently faster than light signals ) @xcite . these issues refer to the different perspective of higher dimensional theories and conventional 4-dimensional ones . in fact , the proposed observational tests of braneworld scenarios must be able to distinguish between higher and lower dimensional effects . moreover , the former effects must appear as corrections of the latter in these models . one of the approaches used to study these collisions is through low energy supergravity limits . since we lack a complete m - theory formulation , the solutions come from the 5-dimensional supergravity theory obtained after a dimensional reduction of the higher dimensional scenario . in the case of type ii - b theory exact solutions to this problem have been found in @xcite , where the motion of the d3 branes towards one another leads to the complete disappearance of the universe in a spacetime singularity .    in the context of heterotic brane models an exact solution of the equations of motion derived from the same horava - witten lagrangian has been found @xcite . as in the previous case , the setup obtained from a dimensional reduction to 5 dimensions evolves to a singularity where the entire spacetime is annihilated . this can be taken as an indication of an inherent classical instability in braneworld models consisting of a positive and a negative tension brane . however , it has recently been proposed a way to avoid the annihilation by introducing an arbitrarily small amount of matter on the negative tension brane @xcite . this alternative scenario is specially appealing for the ekpyrotic and cyclic universe models @xcite due to the momentary disappearance of the orbifold dimension caused by the collision and the subsequent bounce after which both branes continue to expand into the future . in this paper we study the stability of the solution in @xcite by introducing a scalar perturbation . general perturbations of solutions to the einstein equations are very well known in the literature , see e.g. @xcite and further references therein . in the present case we deal with perturbations of time - dependent solutions , a more delicate issue @xcite . although we know from previous discussions that there exists an instability @xcite , our motivation is to check the possibility of obtaining some information about the signatures we would expect before the spacetime collapses . the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 we describe the time - dependent horava - witten solution under study . in the next section we introduce the scalar field perturbation , we solve the corresponding klein - gordon equation in the bulk , and we discuss the field evolution in the setup . finally , we present our conclusions in section 4 . one of the most popular models connecting m - theory with phenomenology is the horava - witten model @xcite . in this setup the 11-dimensional spacetime is the product of a calabi - yau compact manifold and a 5-dimensional spacetime consisting of two parallel 3-branes or domain walls , one with negative tension and the other with positive one . when we perform a dimensional reduction from eleven to five dimensions , we obtain a 5-dimensional supergravity theory which admits an exact static supersymmetric solution of the form @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 is a constant , while @xmath6 is a scalar field characterizing the size of the internal calabi - yau space . the equations of motion for the metric and @xmath6 can be obtained from the lagrangian @xmath7 in this scenario a second domain wall is introduced at @xmath8 , taking @xmath9 as a periodical coordinate with period @xmath10 and making the @xmath11 identification , @xmath12 .    the model based upon this solution is not physically realistic because it is static , while our universe is time - dependent . led by this motivation many attempts to introduce dynamics in this model have been made . remarkable examples are the ekpyrotic model @xcite , where the big bang is regarded as the result of the collision of an external brane with our universe , and the cyclic universe @xcite , where the distance between the branes oscillates in time .    however , recently chen _ et al . _ @xcite found that the lagrangian ( [ lag ] ) also admits a time - dependent 3-brane solution given by @xmath13 with @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 is an arbitrary constant .    if we turn off the time - dependence in this solution , _ i.e. _ , set @xmath17 , we can go back to the time - independent solution ( [ static])-([st - param ] ) by performing the coordinate transformation @xmath18 and rescaling the constant @xmath19 of the original work of lukas _ et al . _ @xcite , where @xmath20 . in fact , this transition between the solutions can be better visualized if we set @xmath21 , which is always possible since it is an integration constant . the solution ( [ metric])-([param ] ) represents a bulk spacetime with two 3-branes with negative and positive tensions as boundaries at @xmath22 and @xmath8 , respectively . the interval @xmath23 is of @xmath1 type , where @xmath24 occupies the strip @xmath25 and the @xmath11 symmetry corresponds to the identification @xmath26 . by choosing @xmath27 as in @xcite we notice that @xmath28 is a positive but decreasing quantity when @xmath29 . the spacetime is bounded in the range @xmath30 , but the proper length of this interval is time - dependent . thus , the separation between the branes decreases as @xmath31 becomes positive , _ i.e. _ , the universe is contracting . when @xmath31 turns out to be positive , @xmath28 vanishes along @xmath32 . this line represents a singularity which first develops on the negative tension brane ( @xmath22 ) at @xmath17 and travels along the orbifold dimension reaching the positive tension brane ( @xmath8 ) after a finite time @xmath33 . the spacetime can not be extended beyond this point . thus , before the branes effectively collide the power - law singularity wraps the whole spacetime . although we know that an instability exists in the present model , we still want to check the possibility of describing its existence before the spacetime collapses . we consider a perturbation in the form of a scalar field obeying the massive klein - gordon equation @xmath34 or equivalently @xmath35    using the metric ( [ metric ] ) in spherical coordinates and the derivatives of @xmath28 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , eq.([kg ] ) can be rewritten as [ kg-1 ] \ { - h^-1/2 _ t ^2 - h h^-3/2 _ t + h^-1/2 _ r ^2 + h^-1/2 _ r + . + h^-1 _ y ^2 + h^-2 ( y ) _ y - m^2 } = 0 . now we decompose the scalar field @xmath38 as ( t , r,,,y ) = z ( t , r , y ) y_m ( , ) , where the spherical harmonics obey the equation _ ( _ y_m ) + _ ^2 y_m = -(+1 ) y_m . thus , the function @xmath39 satisfies the equation [ kg-2 ] -_t ^2 z - _ t z + _ r ^2 z + _ r z - z + h^-1/2 _ y ^2 z + + + h^-3/2 ( y ) _ y z - m^2 h^1/2 z = 0 . @xmath40    in order to separate the radial part we write @xmath41 as @xmath42 . substituting back into ( [ kg-2 ] ) we obtain [ radial ] _ r ^2 r + _ r r + ( ^2 - ) r = 0 , and [ psi ] _ t ^2 + _ t - _ y ^2 - _ y + ( ^2 + m^2 h^1/2 ) = 0 , where @xmath43 is a constant . the solution to equation ( [ radial ] ) is given by r(r ) = j ( + , r ) + y ( + , r ) , where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are bessel functions of first and second kind , respectively , and @xmath46 and @xmath47 are integration constants . the solution of equation ( [ psi ] ) must be obtained by numerical methods . we must thus introduce some values for the parameters @xmath16 , @xmath48 , @xmath43 , and @xmath49 . following @xcite we choose @xmath16 to be negative so that our description of the system begins at a negative time and evolves to a positive time . in order to simplify the calculation we choose the simplest positive values for @xmath48 and @xmath43 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , as well as a positive scalar field mass @xmath49 .    the potential term @xmath52 is shown in fig.([pot ] ) . we see that it is positive - definite although it possesses some singular derivatives along the line @xmath53 . our results for the evolution of the field @xmath54 are shown in figs.[y0]-[y100 ] . @xmath55    .quasinormal frequencies at @xmath22 . [ cols=""^,^,^,^,^,^,^"",options=""header "" , ]     [ t100 ]    fig.[y0 ] provides information on the stability of the system before @xmath17 , when the singularity develops on the negative tension brane . we can see that for earlier times the system is stable . the oscillations show a quasinormal phase where we can calculate quasinormal frequencies ( see table [ t0 ] ) , which show a strong dependence on the value of the parameters @xmath56 and @xmath48 when @xmath57 . we notice that the real part of the frequency increases with @xmath56 and @xmath48 , as well as with @xmath49 . since we calculated the frequencies in the stability range where the oscillations are almost uniform , the imaginary part appears to be very small , and its sign just suggests a slight change in the amplitude of the oscillation ( positive sign indicates an increase , while negative sign indicates a decrease ) . however , as soon as the scalar field detects the formation of the singularity , the oscillations increase in amplitude and frequency , revealing the instability of the system . once the singularity has formed on the negative tension brane , it travels along the extra dimension in the direction of the positive tension brane . analizing our results at a point between the two branes as shown in fig.[y50 ] we observe that the frequency of the scalar field oscillation increases gradually until encountering the singularity . table [ t50 ] shows some quasinormal frequencies calculated by taking the most stable oscillations . after a time @xmath33 the singularity reaches the positive tension brane . in fig.[y100 ] we see how unstable the system becomes at this point . the quasinormal frequencies shown in table [ t100 ] provide evidence of this behaviour , since their positive imaginary part becomes larger than in the previous cases . the singularity eventually wraps both branes and the space between them , which constitutes the bulk , smearing the actual brane collision . in this paper we have considered the time - dependent horava - witten solution found by chen _ we studied the stability of the model by introducing a massive scalar perturbation . we found that before any singularity appears , _ i.e. _ , for @xmath29 , the model evolves without any instability . for such a time - dependent solution it was possible to calculate quasinormal frequencies at different positions along the extra coordinate . we chose 3 representative points to show our results , namely , at the position of each brane and between the two branes . the quasinormal frequencies show a strong dependence on the parameters of the model for a massive scalar field . the larger the parameters @xmath56 and @xmath48 are , or alternatively the larger the mass of the scalar field @xmath49 is , the larger the real part of the fundamental frequency is . this dependence disappears when the mass of the scalar field vanishes .    at @xmath17 a curvature singularity forms on the negative tension brane . this singularity travels along the extra dimension and hits the positive tension brane at @xmath33 , before the two branes actually collide .      despite knowing the instability of this model that leads to a big crunch , we have shown that it is possible to detect it . the evolution of the scalar field used for this purpose can provide some information about the parameters of the model and the extension of the extra dimension .    a complete picture of the instability should also include gravitational perturbations . however , since both the metric and the potential are time - dependent , such a procedure is beyond the aims of the present paper . we wish to thank elcio abdalla , bin wang , and chi yong lin for enlightening discussions . this work has been supported by fundao de amparo  pesquisa do estado de so paulo * ( fapesp ) * , brazil , and fondo nacional de desarrollo cientfico y tecnolgico * ( fondecyt ) * , chile , under grant 3070009 .","**Summary:**

The classical Big Bang model based on Einstein's General Relativity does not explain the origin of the initial singularity. A higher-dimensional string theory model, specifically the Horava-Witten theory, provides a possible explanation. This model suggests that the universe would first appear as a 5-dimensional space with a line as the dimension, and only at high energies would the 4-dimensional universe become visible. The model predicts that the universe would undergo an intermediate regime where the line dimension becomes visible","we consider scalar perturbations in the time - dependent horava - witten model in order to probe its stability . 
 we show that during the non - singular epoque the model evolves without instabilities until it encounters the curvature singularity where a big crunch is supposed to occur . 
 we compute the frequencies of the scalar field oscillation during the stable period and show how the oscillations can be used to prove the presence of such a singularity .

"the study of the properties of baryon resonances is entering a new era with the forthcoming new and more accurate data from new facilities , such as jefferson lab . , mami , elsa and brookhaven . effective models of baryons which are based on three constituents ( @xmath0 ) share a common spin - flavor - color structure but differ in their assumptions on the spatial dynamics . for example , quark potential models in nonrelativistic @xcite or relativized @xcite forms emphasize the single - particle aspects of quark dynamics for which only a few low - lying configurations in the confining potential contribute significantly to the eigenstates of the hamiltonian . on the other hand , some regularities in the observed spectra , such as linear regge trajectories and parity doubling , hint that an alternative , collective type of dynamics may play a role in the structure of baryons .    in this contribution we discuss a collective model within the context of an algebraic approach @xcite and present some results for electromagnetic form factors @xcite and strong decay widths @xcite . 1.75 in    we consider a collective model in which the baryon resonances are interpreted in terms of rotations and vibrations of the string configuration in fig .

"to model magnetization dynamics , currently two paradigms are commonly used in the field : the micromagnetic model and the heisenberg spin model . the micromagnetic model @xcite is ideal when simulating systems with linear dimensions of the order of a few nanometers or larger ; since it is a continuous model that is discretized for computational application , its reliability decreases dramatically when simulating magnetic structures exhibiting a large gradient that can not be resolved by the finite size cells . a textbook example for this scenario is offered by bloch points @xcite ( see fig .  [ fig : bloch ] ) , domain walls and spin waves also belong to this category for particular values of the material parameters . the heisenberg model @xcite is a discrete description , where with every atom in the lattice of the ferromagnet a magnetic moment is associated . since this is a discrete model , its capability to simulate any magnetic structure is not limited by computational artifacts originating from the discretization of a continuum model , which makes it distinct from micromagnetism . on the other hand , the heisenberg model can not be efficiently used to simulate systems larger than a few nanometers due to the computational time increasing faster than linearly with the number of atoms . @xcite in the presented approach ( fig . [ fig : geom ] ) , the entire system is simulated using the micromagnetic model while one or more regions of it containing large gradient structures ( e.g. bloch points ) , are simulated using the discrete heisenberg model . the main obstacle for the development of a combined multiscale technique consists of devising accurate conditions to make the interface between regions on two different scales magnetically smooth , in order to prevent any interface related artifacts .    while in magnetization dynamics , adaptive mesh refinement techniques @xcite have been used , none of these employed different models for different scales . one related approach has been proposed , addressing the problem of interfaces between layers of different magnetic materials @xcite . however , the lack of proper interface conditions , in particular the choice of applying a coarse scaled exchange field on the magnetic moments along the interface in the fine scale region , restricts the validity of this approach to the systems with uniform magnetization across the interface . while this shortcoming has been later resolved in refs . , these approaches were devised to evaluate equilibrium configurations rather than simulating dynamical systems . one further related approach @xcite employed the finite elements method . it should be noted however that while in this case the atomic lattice in the heisenberg model can be rendered more accurately , the computational times can not be dramatically reduced as shown for our finite differences approach in @xcite , making this approach considerably slower . one further multiscale approach @xcite , devised for a different scale combination than the presented one , proposed to use the micromagnetic model as the fine scale model and the maxwell equations as the coarse scale model , this is however restricted to systems with slowly varying magnetization . another work @xcite uses special relativity to evaluate a corrective term to the landau - lifshitz - gilbert equation in the case of domain wall motion . in continuum mechanics @xcite , multiscale approaches are commonly applied to the investigation of mechanical properties of materials , such as their response to deformations and fractures . however , so far it is unclear whether one can develop such a multiscale model for magnetization dynamics that allows one to carry out valid simulations of systems that can not be modeled with the currently available approaches .    in this paper we show the details of the multiscale approach , with a particular focus on the interface conditions that we developed to obtain a smooth interaction between regions on different scales . finally , demonstrations of the validity for the approach are shown , demonstrating the transmission of spin waves across the scale interface without attenuation , and comparing the simulated ground state for structures exhibiting dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction to the analytical theory .    ] .[fig : geom ] ] the multiscale approach solves the landau - lifshitz - gilbert equation numerically for two different models : the coarse grained micromagnetic model , which simulates the whole sample ; and the fine scale model , which is used for magnetic structures that can not be accurately described by the micromagnetic model , discretizing the magnetization field at atomic resolution and simulating it in the intrinsically discrete heisenberg spin model . our software executes in parallel two independent solving routines , one for each model ( it is in principle possible to execute any number of fine scale solving routines ) , performing one full computational step on the coarse scale one and then a short series of steps on the fine scale one centered around the time coordinate of the coarse one ( see fig . [ fig : time_coord ] ) .    , is executed , then corrections to the coarse scale effective field ( generated by the heisenberg fine scale one ) are evaluated . [ fig : time_coord ] ]    the main task towards the development of this technique consisted in modeling the interaction between different regions . this was achieved by applying , after each coarse scale step , a set of magnetic fields designed to approximate the effect of the non - local terms of the effective magnetic field from one region on the other , see fig .  [ fig : boundary ] , namely exchange and stray field . these magnetic fields are designed as follows : the exchange field , generated by the fine scale magnetic moments closest to the interface ( interfacial moments ) , on their neighboring cells in the coarse scale ( interfacial cells ) is evaluated by averaging all the interfacial moments inside each coarse scale cell . the average vector is rescaled by the volume @xmath0 of a cell in the atomic lattice , in order to obtain the magnetization @xmath1 , rather than the magnetic moment @xmath2 . a new finite difference mesh , with coarse scale discretization is created and the cells corresponding to the internal surface of the fine scale region are filled with the difference between the magnetization of the same cell in the original coarse mesh and the new vectors . in this way , the linearity of the exchange field with respect to the magnetization is exploited to evaluate a correction to the field , calculated in the micromagnetic formulation , generated by the original coarse scale cells alone . the corrected exchange field , exerted by the multiscale cell @xmath3 on the micromagnetic cell @xmath4 is calculated as : @xmath5 here @xmath6 denotes the magnetization in the cell @xmath3 in the purely micromagnetic simulation , while @xmath7 is defined as : @xmath8 where the sum runs over all the magnetic moments @xmath9 located along the interface on the side of cell @xmath3 that is neighboring cell @xmath4 . this effective field term is evaluated in the micromagnetic model . likewise , to evaluate the exchange field generated by interfacial cells on interfacial moments , interpolation is employed in order to define a set of new magnetic moments ( ghost moments @xcite ) to act as first neighbors to the interfacial ones . the exchange field generated by the ghost moments is evaluated in the heisenberg spin model . a combination of fine scale moments and coarse scale magnetization is used in the interpolation in order to ensure a smooth transition in the magnetic pattern across the interface . this means that each ghost moment results from the interpolation of atomistic and aptly renormalized micromagnetic vectors . the interpolation can be linear , bilinear or quadrilinear according to the dimensionality of the coarse scale mesh . the same techniques , based on the average of interfacial magnetic moments , and the calculation of ghost moments through interpolation across the interface , are employed when evaluating antisymmetric exchange ( dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction ) across the scale interface .    ] the stray field contains all the long range contributions to the effective fields . the implementation of this field constitutes one of the main differences between the two models . in both scales the demagnetization tensor formulation was employed,@xcite as well as the calculation method based on fft for efficient calculation.@xcite while for the coarse cells the demagnetization tensor describes the interaction between two uniformly magnetized solid rectangles , according to the calculations carried on by newell _ et al . _ , @xcite the demagnetization tensor used for magnetic moments in the fine scale , is defined as : @xmath10,\ ] ] where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the position of two magnetic moments , @xmath13 is 3 @xmath14 3 identity matrix , and symbol @xmath15 denotes the tensor product . similarly to the exchange field , the stray field is linear in the magnetization vector and this property is exploited likewise . the correction to the stray field generated in the micromagnetic system by fine scale regions is evaluated using the averaged value of magnetic moments in each cell .    in order to evaluate the complete demagnetization field acting on the fine scale system , the coarse scale magnetization structure is copied into a new mesh and the cells corresponding to the fine scale region are filled with zero vectors . the stray field generated by this system is evaluated . this technique is employed in order for the field generated by the fine scale region on itself not to be evaluated twice . since the field has the same discretization as the structure generating it , the result is then interpolated , in order for it to have the discretization of the fine scale mesh . the type of linear interpolation depends , as for the ghost moments , on the dimensionality of the mesh . this is the only case for an effective field term evaluated micromagnetically to be applied on the fine scale region . this approximation is made necessary by the computational complexity of the algorithm calculating the field , increasing with @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the number of cells . this dependence is due to the method employed for calculating the demagnetization tensor based on fast fourier transform ( fft ) . @xcite having implemented the approach , we run a series of tests as a demonstration of the validity of our model . the simulated system was a one - dimensional nanowire , @xmath18 long with a square @xmath19 nm@xmath20 section . the fine scale domain was @xmath21 long ( fig . [ fig : wire ] ) , the material parameters for this system are those commonly used for permalloy , namely : @xmath22 a / m , exchange constant @xmath23 j / m , and gilbert damping constant @xmath24 . @xcite for the purpose of efficiency and due to the constraints of the finite difference method , upon which the original software is based , the crystal in the atomistic region is considered to be ordered in a simple cubic lattice with a lattice constant @xmath25 nm , comparable to the ones of iron and nickel . is applied to a section of the fine scale region to excite spin waves . the amplitude of the spin wave is evaluated in the atomistic fine scale cell @xmath3 and the coarse scale cell @xmath4 which is described micromagnetically . [ fig : wire ] ]    spin waves of different frequencies @xmath26 were excited applying an alternating transversal magnetic field , @xmath27 , to a short ( @xmath28 long ) section of the wire . the magnetization as a function of time was measured on the atomistic moment furthest from the region where @xmath27 is applied ( @xmath29 ) , and on the neighboring micromagnetic cell ( @xmath30 ) , the transversal component of the two arrays was normalized , and then analyzed using fft in order to find @xmath31 and @xmath32 . peaks with frequency corresponding to the frequency of @xmath27 were easily identifiable . the height of such peaks increased linearly with the amplitude of @xmath27 . the peaks , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , were squared and the transmission coefficient @xmath35 across the interface has been evaluated by calculating the ratio between the two : @xmath36    for some values of the frequency , a purely atomistic simulation was performed for comparison and with , the aim of obtaining the relation between frequency and wavelength . using fft in the space domain , the corresponding wavenumber @xmath37 was measured for each value of the excitation frequency . in particular , such fourier transforms were evaluated at different time instants and then averaged . once again peaks were easily identifiable . by means of linear regression ( see fig . [ fig : fit ] ) the dependence @xmath38 was measured and the wavelength corresponding to each value of the excitation frequency was calculated as @xmath39 .     and the excitation frequency @xmath40 . [ fig : fit ] ] three sets of simulations were performed , with different lengths of the micromagnetic cells , corresponding to ten , twenty and thirty times @xmath41 . the data show ideal transmission for frequency values smaller than a sharply defined cut - off frequency . the same data , as a function of the wavelength , show consistently that the transmission drops to zero at a cut - off wavelength corresponding to a specific value of the coarse cell size . this universal behavior can be considered as a limitation of computational micromagnetism , which does not allow one to simulate very short wavelength spin waves without refining the mesh , introducing therefore a dramatic increase in the computation time ( fig . [ fig:1 ] ) . ( a ) and wavelength @xmath42 ( b ) . a transmission of 1 ( @xmath43 ) for a wide range of wavelengths demonstrates the numerical validity of the model . [ fig:1],title=""fig : "" ]   ( a ) and wavelength @xmath42 ( b ) . a transmission of 1 ( @xmath43 ) for a wide range of wavelengths demonstrates the numerical validity of the model . [ fig:1],title=""fig : "" ]    since we assume that the frequency cut - off is a consequence of the coarse scale not being able to resolve waves with such a high frequency , we simulated a similar system , this time with the excitation being applied on the coarse scale region only . here the waves propagate into and then out of the fine scale region and the transmission is measured for waves leaving the fine scale region ( fig .  [ fig:2 ] ) . the test was repeated using periodic boundary conditions to make sure that the sharp cut - off was not caused by the waves being reflected at the end of the wire . both tests were then repeated for different values of the exchange constant .    . the data shown is the result of an average on all the frequencies . peaks with frequency higher than @xmath44 were not visible in the fourier transform , underlining the fact that the cutoff is a consequence of the waves not being resolved for the chosen cell - size . the observed transmission of approximately @xmath45 shows the validity of the method with no artificial attenuation at the interface between the regions where different models are used . [ fig:2 ] ]    in order to measure the cut - off frequencies , a linear regression was executed on all the transmission values between @xmath46 and @xmath47 , the intersection of this line with the transmission value of @xmath48 was defined as the cut - off frequency . we assume the cut - off to be a direct consequence of the exchange interaction not being accurately evaluated in the micromagnetic model when the angle in the magnetization between two neighboring cells is too large . the dependence of the cut - off frequency on the exchange constant supports this hypothesis ( see fig . [ fig:3 ] ) .     for waves excited in the fine scale region with closed and periodic boundary conditions ( bc ) for different values of the exchange constant @xmath49 . a cut - off frequency depending on the exchange constant demonstrates that this phenomenon is strictly micromagnetic and is not introduced by the multi - scale approach . [ fig:3 ] ] to demonstrate the reliability of the method used to evaluate effective fields across the interface by direct comparison to analytical theory , a system exhibiting antisymmetric exchange@xcite was simulated . a nanowire , similar in shape to the one used to test spin wave transmission , with the parameters @xmath50 a / m , exchange constant @xmath51 j / m . different values of @xmath52 were used . the vector @xmath53 scales the energy density of the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction ( dmi ) as calculated in ref . [ ] : @xmath54 the system was relaxed in a coarse scale simulation , then a fine scale region was applied on a section of the wire and the system was relaxed again . the relaxed state ( see fig .  [ fig : dmi ] ) showing continuity in the helix structure , typical of systems exhibiting dmi , with a pitch in agreement with the predicted@xcite value of @xmath55 . the pitch was evaluated from the fourier transform in the space domain for the two components of the helix , using the data points from both scales and taking the peak value from the fourier transform . the components of @xmath56 evidently have a perfectly sinusoidal shape , see fig . [ fig : dmi ] ( a ) . plane , showing continuity and consistency of the period in the coarse and fine scale . the dashed lines show the position of the fine scale region . b ) the wavenumber of the helix increases linearly with the dmi constant and is consistent with the expected value . @xcite [ fig : dmi],title=""fig : "" ]   plane , showing continuity and consistency of the period in the coarse and fine scale . the dashed lines show the position of the fine scale region . b ) the wavenumber of the helix increases linearly with the dmi constant and is consistent with the expected value . @xcite [ fig : dmi],title=""fig : "" ] a tracking algorithm was devised in order to keep the fine scale region as small as possible , it scans the fine scale region for the position of the structure of interest ( soi ) , usually the spin structure with large magnetization gradients , and shifts the fine scale region by an integer number of coarse scale cells units , in order to always have the soi close to its center . when micromagnetic cells previously not part of the fine scale region become included , interpolation is applied in order to fill in the fine scale mesh with magnetic moments that accurately reproduce the coarse scale magnetization and are continuous within and across the scale interface .    to show that the fine scale area can be reliably moved , a test was performed . this test simulated domain wall motion in a nanostrip ( @xmath57 ) induced by a unidirectional magnetic field . the material parameters of the strip are the same as the nanowire from the previous test with the only exception of gilbert damping @xmath58 . the domain wall is initially in the center of the fine scale region , when the distance from the starting position becomes larger than a certain threshold ( tracking distance ) , the whole fine scale region is shifted , in order to keep it centered . the test was repeated for different tracking distances to show that this process does not influence the dynamics of the system ( fig . [ fig:4 ] ) .    ] we have presented an innovative methodology to perform magnetization dynamics simulations in the systems which can not be accurately simulated otherwise . since some of such systems describe phenomena , including vortex cores switching @xcite and skyrmion nucleation , @xcite are considered to be important problems in spintronics , we deem this methodology a key step to advance this field . in order to improve the technique and establish multiscale simulations as a valuable tool , its basic features have been described and its limits have been tested . the transmission data for the spin waves shows that information about magnetic structures in the fine region can cross perfectly the scale interface , thus demonstrating the reliability and numerical validity of our model . a thorough analysis of the cut - off phenomenon found for spin wave transmission shows that in the presence of spin waves with a short wavelength the multiscale approach can be reliably used under the condition that the waves do not leave the fine scale region . meanwhile , the traditional approach  a refinement of the whole mesh  would increase the computational time dramatically . the simulations including the dmi further show that the method employed for evaluating cross scale interactions ensures continuity between the regions of different scales and yield quantitative agreement with the analytical theory . moreover , the domain wall data indicates the reliability of the tracking algorithm and its effectiveness as a method to keep the size of the fine scale regions at a minimum and not introducing artifacts to the simulated results .    as a future direction we propose to analyze the dynamics of magnetic vortex core reversal , a phenomenon that requires a similar approach in order to be accurately simulated . @xcite further research will include magnetic structures such as skyrmions which are stabilized by dmi and where the nucleation involves bloch points . in the long term , there is room for further improvements : generalizing the approach beyond simple cubic lattices in the fine scale region , optimization of the computational routines , extension of this approach to antiferromagnets and nonzero temperatures are some of the examples that will broaden the applicability even further . a.d.l . is a recipient of a scholarship through the excellence initiative by the graduate school materials science in mainz ( gsc 266 ) , b.k . is the recipient of the carl zeiss postdoc scholarship  multiskalensimulationen fr energiesparende magnetisierungsmanipulation . the authors acknowledge the support of spinnet ( daad spintronics network , project number 56268455 ) and the dfg ( sfb trr 173 spin+x ) . o.a.t . acknowledges support by the grants - in - aid for scientific research ( grants no . 25800184 , no . 25247056 and no . 15h01009 ) from mext , japan . we are thankful to u. nowak and d. hinzke from the university of konstanz for their help with testing the fine scale model .    1 a. aharoni , j. phys . colloq . * 32 * , 966 - 971 ( 1971 ) . a. thiaville , j.m . garcia , r. dittrich , j. miltat , t. schrefl , phys . b * 67 * , 094410 ( 2003 ) . a. polyakov , phys . b * 59 * , 79 - 81 ( 1975 ) . d. hinzke and u. nowak , phys . sol .

The micromagnetic model is a continuous model that discretizes the magnetic field, while the Heisenberg model is a discrete model that describes the magnetic moments of individual atoms. The multiscale approach uses a combination of both models to simulate the behavior of magnetic systems with varying scales.

The text highlights the limitations of the micromagnetic model,","simulations of magnetization dynamics in a multiscale environment enable rapid evaluation of the landau - lifshitz - gilbert equation in a mesoscopic sample with nanoscopic accuracy in areas where such accuracy is required . 
 we have developed a multiscale magnetization dynamics simulation approach that can be applied to large systems with spin structures that vary locally on small length scales . to implement this , 
 the conventional micromagnetic simulation framework has been expanded to include a multiscale solving routine . 
 the software selectively simulates different regions of a ferromagnetic sample according to the spin structures located within in order to employ a suitable discretization and use either a micromagnetic or an atomistic model . to demonstrate the validity of the multiscale approach , we simulate the spin wave transmission across the regions simulated with the two different models and different discretizations . 
 we find that the interface between the regions is fully transparent for spin waves with frequency lower than a certain threshold set by the coarse scale micromagnetic model with no noticeable attenuation due to the interface between the models . as a comparison to exact analytical theory ,

body interactions in one dof do not appear in naturally physical systems and can not be implemented by solely using linear optical elements . the two - body interactions involved in one single photon , which necessary for our toffoli and fredkin gates , can be achieved by employing linear optics . additional photons , necessary for the cross - kerr - based , cluster - based , or parity - check based quantum computing , are not required in our schemes , and the diamond nv center only provides a platform for photon - photon interactions . compared to the ones synthesized by cnot and single -

"this work on pricing american options under proportional transaction costs goes back to the seminal discovery by @xcite that to hedge against a buyer who can exercise the option at any ( ordinary ) stopping time , the seller must in effect be protected against all mixed ( randomised ) stopping times . this was followed by @xcite , who established a non - constructive dual representation for the set of strategies superhedging the seller s ( though not the buyer s ) position in an american option under transaction costs . efficient iterative algorithms for computing the upper and lower hedging prices of the option , the hedging strategies , optimal stopping times as well as dual representations for both the seller and the buyer of an american option under transaction costs were developed by @xcite in a model with two assets , and @xcite in a multi - asset model . all these approaches take it for granted that the buyer can only exercise the option instantly , at an ordinary stopping time of his choosing .    by contrast , in the present paper we allow the buyer the flexibility to exercise an american option gradually , rather than all at a single time instance . though it would be difficult in practice to exercise a fraction of an option contract and to hold on to the reminder to exercise it later , the holder of a large portfolio of options may well choose to exercise the individual contracts on different dates if that proves beneficial . does this ability to exercise gradually affect the pricing bounds , hedging strategies and optimal stopping times for the buyer and/or seller ? perhaps surprisingly , the answer to this question is yes , it does in the presence of transaction costs . gradual exercise turns out to be linked to another feature , referred to as deferred solvency , which will also be studied here . if a temporary loss of liquidity occurs in the market , as reflected by unusually large bid - ask spreads , agents may become insolvent . being allowed to defer closing their positions until liquidity is restored might enable them to become solvent once again . this gives more leeway when constructing hedging strategies than the usual requirement that agents should remain solvent at all times . @xcite was the first to explore the consequences of gradual exercise and deferred solvency using a model with a single risky asset as a testing ground . in the present paper these ideas are developed in a systematic manner and extended to the much more general setting of the multi - asset market model with transaction costs due to @xcite ; see also @xcite and @xcite . pricing and hedging for the seller of an american option under transaction costs is a convex optimisation problem irrespective of whether instant or gradual exercise is permitted . however , this is not so for the buyer . in this case one has to tackle a non - convex optimisation problem for options that can only be exercised instantly . a very interesting consequence of gradual exercise is that pricing and hedging becomes a convex optimisation problem also for the buyer of an american option , making it possible to deploy convex duality methods . the convexity of the problem also makes it much easier to implement the pricing and hedging algorithms numerically . we will make use of this new opportunity in this paper . the paper is organised as follows . section  [ sect - multi - curr - mod ] recalls the general setting of kabanov s multi - asset model with transaction costs . in section  [ sect : inst - versus - grad - exe ] the hedging strategies for the buyer and seller and the corresponding option prices under gradual exercise are introduced and compared with the same notions under instant exercise . a toy example is set up to demonstrate that it is easier to hedge an option and that the bid - ask spread of the option prices can be narrower under gradual exercise as compared to instant exercise . in section  [ sect : seller ] the seller s case is studied in detail . the notion of deferred solvency is first discussed and linked in proposition  [ prop : am : seller : immediate - ultimate ] with the hedging problem for the seller of an american option with gradual exercise . the sets of seller s hedging portfolios are then constructed and related to the ask price of the option under gradual exercise and to a construction of a seller s hedging strategy realising the ask price ; see theorem  [ prop : seller : zau0=initial - endowments ] . a dual representation of the seller s price is established in theorem  [ thm : ask - price - representation ] . the toy example is revisited to illustrate the various constructions and results for the seller . section  [ sect : buyer ] is devoted to the buyer s case . buyer s hedging portfolios and strategies are constructed and used to compute the bid price of the option ; see theorem  [ prop:2012 - 07 - 26:hedging - construct ] . finally , the dual representation for the buyer is explored in theorem  [ th : bu - buyer ] . once again , the toy example serves to illustrate the results . a numerical example with three assets can be found in section  [ sec : num - example ] . some conclusions and possible further developments and ramifications are touched upon in section  [ sect : conclusions ] . technical information and proofs are collected in the appendix . let @xmath0 be a filtered probability space . we assume that @xmath1 is finite , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 for all @xmath5 . for each @xmath6 let @xmath7 be the collection of atoms of @xmath8 , called the _ nodes _ of the associated tree model . a node @xmath9 is said to be a _ successor _ of a node @xmath10 if @xmath11 . for each @xmath12 we denote the collection of successors of any given node @xmath10 by @xmath13 .    for each @xmath6 let @xmath14 be the collection of @xmath8-measurable @xmath15-valued random variables . we identify elements of @xmath16 with functions on @xmath7 whenever convenient . we consider the discrete - time currency model introduced by @xcite and developed further by @xcite and @xcite among others . the model contains @xmath17 assets or currencies . at each trading date @xmath18 and for each @xmath19 one unit of asset  @xmath20 can be obtained by exchanging @xmath21 units of asset  @xmath22 . we assume that the exchange rates @xmath23 are @xmath8-measurable and @xmath24 for all @xmath25 and @xmath26 . we say that a portfolio @xmath27 is can be _ exchanged _ into a portfolio @xmath28 at time  @xmath25 whenever there are @xmath8-measurable random variables @xmath29 , @xmath30 such that for all @xmath31 @xmath32 where @xmath33 represents the number of units of asset  @xmath20 received as a result of exchanging some units of asset  @xmath22 .    the _ solvency cone _ @xmath34 is the set of portfolios that are _ solvent _ at time  @xmath25 , i.e.  the portfolios at time @xmath25 that can be exchanged into portfolios with non - negative holdings in all @xmath17 assets . it is straightforward to show that @xmath35 is the convex cone generated by the canonical basis @xmath36 of @xmath15 and the vectors @xmath37 for @xmath30 , and so @xmath35 is a polyhedral cone , hence closed . note that @xmath35 contains all the non - negative elements of @xmath16 . a _ trading strategy _ @xmath38 is a predictable @xmath15-valued process with final value @xmath39 and initial endowment @xmath40 . for each @xmath41 the portfolio @xmath42 is held from time @xmath43 to time @xmath25 . let  @xmath44 be the set of trading strategies . we say that @xmath45 is a _ self - financing _ strategy whenever @xmath46 for all @xmath12 . note that no implicitly assumed self - financing condition is included in the definition of  @xmath44 .    a trading strategy @xmath45 is an _ arbitrage opportunity _ if it is self - financing , @xmath47 and there is a portfolio @xmath48 with non - negative holdings in all @xmath17 assets such that @xmath49 . this notion of arbitrage was considered by @xcite , and its absence is formally different but equivalent to the weak no - arbitrage condition introduced by @xcite . [ th:2012 - 10 - 03:ftap ] the model admits no arbitrage opportunity if and only if there exists a probability measure  @xmath50 equivalent to  @xmath51 and an @xmath15-valued @xmath50-martingale @xmath52 such that @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the polar of @xmath55 ; see ( [ eq:2012 - 09 - 20:aast ] ) in the appendix . we denote by @xmath56 the set of pairs @xmath57 satisfying the conditions in theorem  [ th:2012 - 10 - 03:ftap ] , and by @xmath58 the set of pairs @xmath57 satisfying the conditions in theorem  [ th:2012 - 10 - 03:ftap ] but with @xmath50 absolutely continuous with respect to ( and not necessarily equivalent to )  @xmath51 . we assume for the remainder of this paper that the model admits no arbitrage opportunities , i.e.  @xmath59 .    in place of a pair @xmath60 one can equivalently use the so - called _ consistent price process _ @xmath61 ; see @xcite . we also define for any @xmath62 @xmath63 in the absence of arbitrage @xmath54 is a non - empty compactly @xmath64-generated polyhedral cone for all @xmath25 ( * ? ? ? * remark  2.2 ) , which means that @xmath65 . ( for the definition of a compactly @xmath64-generated cone , see appendix  [ subsect : comp - gen - cones ] . ) the payoff of an american option in the model with @xmath17 underlying currencies is , in general , an @xmath15-valued adapted process @xmath66 . the seller of the american option is obliged to deliver , and the buyer is entitled to receive the portfolio of currencies @xmath67 at a stopping time @xmath68 chosen by the buyer . here @xmath69 denotes the family of stopping times with values in @xmath70 . this is the usual setup in which the option is exercised _ instantly _ at a stopping time  @xmath68 . american options with the provision for instant exercise in the multi - currency model under proportional transaction costs have been studied by @xcite , who established a non - constructive characterisation of the superhedging strategies for the option seller only , and by @xcite , who provided computationally efficient iterative constructions of the ask and bid option prices and the superhedging strategies for both the option seller and buyer .    in the present paper we relax the requirement that the option needs to be exercised instantly at a stopping time @xmath68 . instead , we allow the buyer to exercise _ gradually _ at a mixed stopping time @xmath71 . ( for the definition of mixed stopping times , see appendix  [ sect : mixed - stop - times ] . ) if the buyer chooses to exercise the option gradually according to a mixed stopping time @xmath71 , then the seller of the american option will be obliged to deliver , and the buyer will be entitled to receive the fraction  @xmath72 of the portfolio of currencies  @xmath73 at each time @xmath6 .    the question then arises whether or not it would be more beneficial for the buyer to exercise the option gradually rather than instantly ? what will be the optimal mixed stopping time @xmath71 for the buyer ? how should the seller hedge against gradual exercise ? are the ask ( seller s ) and bid ( buyer s ) option prices and hedging strategies affected by gradual exercise as compared to instant exercise ?      in the case of instant exercise the seller of an american option  @xmath74 needs to hedge by means of a trading strategy  @xmath45 against all ordinary stopping times @xmath68 chosen by the buyer . the trading strategy  @xmath75 needs to be self - financing up to time  @xmath76 and to allow the seller to remain solvent on delivering the portfolio @xmath67 at time  @xmath76 , for any  @xmath68 . hence the family of seller s superhedging strategies is defined as @xmath77 and the _ ask price _ ( _ seller s price _ ) of the option in currency @xmath62 is @xmath78 this is the smallest amount in currency  @xmath64 needed to superhedge a short position in  @xmath74 .    on the other hand , the buyer of an american option  @xmath74 can select both a stopping time  @xmath68 and a trading strategy  @xmath45 . the trading strategy  @xmath75 needs to be self - financing up to time  @xmath76 and to allow the buyer to remain solvent on receiving the portfolio @xmath67 at time  @xmath76 . thus , the family of buyer s superhedging strategies is defined as @xmath79 and the _ bid price _ ( _ buyer s price _ ) of the option in currency @xmath62 is @xmath80 this is the largest amount in currency  @xmath64 that the buyer can raise using the option  @xmath74 as surety .    for american options with instant exercise , iterative constructions of the ask and bid option prices @xmath81 and @xmath82 and the corresponding seller s and buyer s superhedging strategies from @xmath83 and @xmath84 were established by @xcite . when the buyer is allowed to exercise gradually , the seller needs to follow a suitable trading strategy to hedge his exposure . since the seller can react to the buyer s actions , this strategy may in general depend on the mixed stopping time @xmath71 followed by the buyer , and will be denoted by @xmath85 . in other words , we consider a function @xmath86 .    at each time @xmath25 the seller will be holding a portfolio @xmath87 and will be obliged to deliver a fraction @xmath72 of the payoff @xmath73 . he can then rebalance the remaining portfolio @xmath88 into @xmath89 in a self - financing manner , so that @xmath90the self - financing and superhedging conditions have merged into one . we call ( [ eq : seller - self - fin - superhedge ] ) the _ rebalancing _ condition . when creating the portfolio @xmath87 at time  @xmath43 , the seller can only use information available at that time . this includes @xmath91 , but the seller has no way of knowing the future values @xmath92 that will be chosen by the buyer . the trading strategies @xmath85 that can be adopted by the seller are therefore restricted to those satisfying the _ non - anticipation _ condition @xmath93 in particular , the initial endowment @xmath94 of the trading strategy @xmath95 is the same for all @xmath71 . we denote this common value by  @xmath96 . we define the family of seller s superhedging strategies against gradual exercise by @xmath97 and the corresponding _ ask price _ ( _ seller s price _ ) of the option in currency @xmath98 by @xmath99 this is the smallest amount in currency  @xmath22 that the seller needs to superhedge a short position in the american option  @xmath74 when the buyer is allowed to exercise gradually .    on the other hand , the buyer is able to select both a mixed stopping time @xmath71 and a trading strategy @xmath45 , and will be taking delivery of a fraction  @xmath72 of the payoff  @xmath73 at each time  @xmath25 . because the choice of the mixed stopping time  @xmath100 is up to the buyer , the trading strategy @xmath75 needs to be good just for the one chosen stopping time , and does not need to be considered as a function of  @xmath100 , in contrast to the seller s case . the _ rebalancing _ condition @xmath101 needs to be satisfied . hence , the family of superhedging strategies for the buyer of an american option  @xmath74 with gradual exercise is defined as @xmath102 and the corresponding _ bid price _ ( _ buyer s price _ ) of the option in currency @xmath98 is @xmath103 this is the largest amount in currency  @xmath22 that can be raised using the option as surety by a buyer who is able to exercise gradually .

"the topic of control over a communication channel has been extensively studied in the past decade , with issues such as the minimum data rate for stabilization @xcite and optimal quadratic closed - loop performance @xcite being the main focus . other issues of interest concern effects of channel - induced packet drops and/or time - varying delays on closed - loop performance .    the majority of papers concerned with control over networks regards the mechanism of information loss in the network as probabilistic but not strategic . in contrast , in the problem of control over an _ adversarial _ channel , the communication link is controlled by a rogue jammer whose intention is to mount a cyber attack on the system by actively jamming the communication link . its objectives are to impose on the controller a control law which can not be expected under regular operating conditions in a packet - dropping network . if the controller is unaware of the jammer s actions and continues to follow a control policy designed for a regular network , the system performance is likely to be inferior . it is this situation that is considered as a scenario of a successful cyber attack by the jammer .    a natural way to describe the problem of control over an adversarial channel is to employ a game - theoretic formulation . originally proposed in  @xcite , this idea has been followed upon in a number of recent papers including  @xcite . a zero - sum dynamic game between a controller performing a finite horizon linear - quadratic control task and a jammer , proposed in @xcite , specifically accounted for the jammer s strategic intentions and limited actuation capabilities , but was otherwise agnostic regarding the type of channel involved . a startling conclusion of @xcite was that in order to maximally disrupt the control task , the jammer must act in a markedly different way than a legitimate , non - malicious , packet - dropping channel . once this deterministic behavior is observed by the controller , it can establish with certainty that an attack has taken place .    in  @xcite , we introduced a different model , which , while capturing the same fundamental aspects of the problem as in @xcite , modified the jammer s action space so that each jammer decision corresponded to a choice of channel rather than to passing / blocking transmission . the corresponding one - step zero - sum game was shown to have a unique saddle point in the space of mixed jammer strategies . in turn , the controller s best response to the jammer s optimal randomized strategy was to act as if it was operating over a packet - dropping channel whose statistical characteristics were controlled by the jammer . since under normal circumstances the controller can not be aware of these characteristics , and can not implement such a best response strategy , we regard the zero - sum game in  @xcite as an example of a successful cyber attack .    in this paper , we show that such a situation is not specific to the zero - sum game considered in  @xcite . we introduce a class of zero - sum stochastic games that generalize the model introduced in  @xcite . for these games we obtain necessary and sufficient conditions which guarantee the existence of optimal jammer s strategies whose nature suggests that the jammer must select its actions randomly , in order to make a maximum impact on the control performance . our conditions are quite general , they apply to nonlinear systems and draw on standard convexity / coercivity properties of payoff functions . furthermore , we specialize these conditions to the linear - quadratic control problem over a packet - dropping link considered in  @xcite and show that our conditions allow for an express characterization of a set of plant s initial states for which optimal randomized jammer strategies exist ( this is in contrast to  @xcite where a complete analysis of the state space had to be performed to determine such regions ) . we also compute an optimal controller response to those strategies , which turns out to be nonlinear . our analysis is restricted to one - step zero - sum games . although such a formulation is admittedly simple , due to the general nature of the game under consideration , it can be thought of as reflecting a more general situation where one is dealing with a one - step hamilton - jacobi - bellman - isaacs min - max problem associated with a multi - step optimal control problem . also , even a one - step formulation provides a rich insight into a possible scenario of cyber attacks on controller networks . we believe that such an insight can be valuable as was the case , e.g. , in early studies of adversarial channels and multi - agent decision problems involving incomplete information . we present our model in section  [ sec_mod ] . the problem formulation , its assumptions and preliminary results are given in section  [ sec_form ] . the main result of the paper that gives a necessary and sufficient condition for the game under consideration to have a nontrivial saddle point is presented in section  [ main ] . next , in section  [ examples ] we demonstrate an application of this result to the linear - quadratic static problem which is an extension of the problem in  @xcite . in this problem , the jammer is offered an additional reward for undertaking actions concealing its presence . conclusions are given in section  [ conclusions ] . the general model description is an extension of that in  @xcite . we consider a situation where a strategic jammer is attacking the link in the feedback loop between a controller and a plant . the plant is a general discrete - time system described by @xmath0 with a given initial condition ; @xmath1 is the state , @xmath2 is a scalar input , @xmath3 is an @xmath4-valued function defined on @xmath5 . the plant input @xmath2 and the control signal @xmath6 are related by the equation @xmath7 which describes the transmission of information from the controller to the plant over a packet - dropping communication link . here , @xmath8 is a discrete random variable taking value in @xmath9 , that describes the transmission state of the link . the value of @xmath8 depends on actions of the jammer and the state of the communication link , as explained below . the communication link consists of a finite set @xmath10 of channels ( with @xmath11 ) out of which the jammer can draw with certain probability a channel to replace the currently active channel so as to optimally disrupt the control task . each channel can be either in passing or blocking state , and the transmission states of _ all _ channels randomly change _ after _ one of them is selected as a replacement . hence , each channel @xmath12 represents a binary channel with the state space @xmath9 , as pictured in figure  [ fig_2 ] . to describe the probability model of channel transitions , let @xmath13 denote the vectors of transmission states of _ all _ channels before and after the jammer has selected one of them to replace the current one , respectively , with the @xmath14th component @xmath15 , @xmath16 denoting the corresponding transmission state of channel @xmath17 . the probability of channel @xmath17 to become `` passing '' after the replacement is selected , given its and all other channels previous transmission states , is then @xmath18    the jammer strategy is to choose a probability distribution over @xmath10 , indicating which channel it desires to switch to . we denote this distribution by a vector @xmath19 in the unit simplex @xmath20 of @xmath21 . that is , the jammer s strategy is to influence the selection of a channel linking the controller to the plant . let the index of the selected channel be @xmath22 , then @xmath22 is a discrete random variable taking values in @xmath23 , distributed in accordance with the vector @xmath19 . the latter depends on the information set available to the jammer which includes the current state of the plant @xmath24 , the index of the channel occupying the link @xmath25 , and the vector of transmission states of all channels @xmath26 which jammer observes before the link switches from channel @xmath27 to a new channel : @xmath28 in addition , if the control input @xmath6 is available to the jammer , the vector @xmath19 may depend on @xmath6 as well . after the jammer has made its decision , the random variable @xmath22 is realized and the link switches to the channel @xmath29 . after that , the transmission state of all channels including @xmath29 changes , according to ( [ q_j ] ) . thus , the jammer can not predict the transmission state of the channels in @xmath10 when selecting the probability vector @xmath19 .    in accordance with this channel switching mechanism , the transmission state of the link between the controller and the plant is determined by the binary random variable @xmath30 , i.e. , @xmath31 , which takes value 1 with probability @xmath32 and value 0 with probability @xmath33 . clearly , @xmath8 and @xmath22 are statistically dependent . all random variables considered in this paper will be adapted to the joint conditional probability distribution of @xmath22 and @xmath8 , given @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 . the expectation with respect to this conditional probability distribution is denoted @xmath34 $ ] . 1.5ex     is a binary channel . shown here is channel @xmath17 . [ fig_2 ] ] we now introduce a general two - player stochastic one - step zero - sum game as follows . in this game , we assume that the initial state of the plant @xmath24 , the initial vector of transmission states @xmath26 and the channel that initially occupies the link @xmath27 are known to both the jammer and controller . let @xmath35 be a scalar function of @xmath36 . this function will determine the payoff of the game played by the controller and the jammer . the standing assumptions regarding this function are summarized below :    [ sigma.a1 ] for all @xmath12 , @xmath37 . [ sigma.a3 ] for each @xmath12 and @xmath38 , the functions @xmath39 and @xmath40 are coercive .

[ sigma.a4 ] the set @xmath51 is connected .    under this assumption , the set @xmath51 is a closed bounded interval , hence it is a convex set . of course , this can be guaranteed when @xmath60 is chosen so that each @xmath61 is convex . [ bo.t4 ] under assumptions  [ sigma.a1 ] ,  [ sigma.a3 ] , and [ sigma.a4 ] , the value of the game ( [ inf_sup ] ) exists , i.e. , @xmath62 furthermore , the game has a ( possibly non - unique ) saddle point . it is not unreasonable to assume that in the game ( [ inf_sup ] ) the jammer , who observes the controller action @xmath6 , can rank all the channels according to the contribution they make towards the payoff and order them accordingly . it can do so by comparing the conditional expected cost values @xmath63 $ ] . [ sigma.a2 ] for any two channels @xmath64 , @xmath65 , if @xmath66 then @xmath67\ge     \mathbb{e}[\sigma(x^+,u , f_ss)|s = k ] \\ \nonumber \forall u\in u(x ) . \end{aligned}\ ] ]    assumption  [ sigma.a2 ] generalizes the situation considered in  @xcite where all channels were ranked according to the probability of becoming passing , @xmath68 . in section  [ examples ] we will show that such a natural ranking leads to satisfaction of assumption  [ sigma.a2 ] .    according to this assumption , the jammer who seeks a higher value of payoff should favour channels with lower numbers , since a larger reward is associated with these channels . in contrast , the controller actions should be directed towards forcing the jammer into utilizing channels with higher numbers . also , the channel @xmath27 is excluded from this ranking . this is done to allow the jammer to consider contributions to payoff other than those based on blocking / passing . these considerations may either discourage the jammer from switching , or conversely encourage it to undertake a denial - of - service attack . such decisions can be influenced by a number of factors that are not related to channel properties . the cost of channel switching is one reason as to why the jammer may decide not to change the channel . under another scenario , the jammer may be offered a reward for remaining stealthy , and may choose this reward over disrupting the control loop . for instance , when the controller monitors the link , an anomaly in the channel transition probabilities could signal the attack . in this case , rewarding the jammer for not defaulting to the most blocking channel unless it is absolutely necessary will provide it with an incentive for not revealing itself . in yet another class of problems , the jammer s decision could be based on the knowledge that the system is prepared to tolerate service disruptions as long as the cost of such disruptions is below the cost of rectifying them . we defer detailed analyses of these situations to section  [ examples ] . it should be stressed that jammer decisions in each of these scenarios will depend on the plant state @xmath24 , the channel @xmath27 and the channel ranking ( the latter may require knowledge of @xmath6 ) .    using the channel ranking introduced in assumption  [ sigma.a2 ] , the value and saddle points of the game ( [ inf_sup ] ) can be characterized by solving a game over a reduced jammer strategy space . this reduced game focuses on two channels , namely the channel that currently occupies the link and the channel that delivers the highest payoff to the jammer when it seeks to block communications between the controller and the plant . the latter channel is indexed as channel @xmath69 , by assumption  [ sigma.a2 ] . let us introduce the reduced jammer action vector @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 . also , consider payoffs associated with selecting channel @xmath69 and keeping the current channel @xmath27 : @xmath73   , \\ \tilde h_2(u)&= & \mathbb{e}\left[\sigma(x^+,u , f_s)|s = j^-\right ] , \end{aligned}\ ] ] and define @xmath74 . consider the following ` reduced ' two - player game with upper value @xmath75 and lower value @xmath76    [ only.two ] suppose assumptions  [ sigma.a1]-[sigma.a2 ] are satisfied . then @xmath77 furthermore , the zero - sum game ( [ inf_sup.red ] ) has a ( possibly non - unique ) saddle point . also , if @xmath78 is such a saddle point , then @xmath79 is a saddle point of the game ( [ inf_sup ] ) , where @xmath80 lemma  [ only.two ] allows the jammer to constrain its actions to the set @xmath81 . among these actions there are two trivial actions : choose the most blocking channel ( channel @xmath69 in our notation ) by using @xmath82 and @xmath83 , or stay put by allocating @xmath84 and @xmath85 , so that the controller continues communicating with the plant over channel @xmath27 . however , the question arises as to whether there exist _ optimal mixed strategies _ in @xmath86 for the jammer to undertake , i.e. , optimal policy vectors @xmath19 such that @xmath87 , @xmath88 . the first main result of this paper provides necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of nontrivial saddle points . these conditions characterize the controller - jammer games in which the jammer randomizes its choice of optimal strategies . as we will see , this will force the controller to respond in a non - obvious manner in order to remain optimal , which ultimately represents a signature of an attack on the communication link . [ saddle.point ] suppose @xmath89 , @xmath90 are strictly convex functions of @xmath6 for all @xmath24 . for every @xmath24 , the zero - sum game ( [ inf_sup.red ] ) admits a nontrivial saddle point @xmath78 if and only if there exists @xmath91 such that @xmath92 and one of the following conditions hold : either @xmath93 or @xmath94 in this section , we specialize theorem  [ saddle.point ] to the controller - jammer game where the plant is linear , @xmath95 and the performance cost is quadratic . in this game the jammer is rewarded for remaining stealthy . we show that in this game , there is a region in the plant state space where the jammer s optimal policy is to randomize its channel selection . furthermore , an optimal control response to this optimal jammer action is nonlinear . consider a controller - jammer game for the plant ( [ plant.lin ] ) with the quadratic payoff @xmath96 here , @xmath97 is the kronecker symbol , and @xmath98 is the constant ` reward for stealthiness ' which the jammer receives if the channel does not change as a result of its action . as explained earlier , the rationale here is to reward the jammer for keeping the current channel in the link when excessive switching may reveal its presence , or may drain its resources . this controller - jammer game was analyzed in  @xcite ( for a one - dimensional plant ) , where the region in the state - space was found where the game has a unique saddle point corresponding to a jammer s nontrivial strategy . such a region was found by computing the game value directly , which required a quite tedious analysis . here , we revisit this result of  @xcite from a more general perspective , using conditions of theorem  [ saddle.point ] . the corresponding function @xmath60 in this case is @xmath99    clearly , the function @xmath60 defined in ( [ lq.cost ] ) satisfies assumptions  [ sigma.a1 ] and  [ sigma.a3 ] . also in this case , the functions @xmath61 have the form @xmath100 \nonumber \\        & = & \gamma_j(x)+u^2+r_jq_ju(u+2\beta(x ) ) ,    \label{hj.lau3}\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath101 @xmath102 , and @xmath103 for all @xmath14 . also , the available channels are assumed to be ordered according to their probability to become passing , that is , @xmath104    [ u.lq ] under condition ( [ qq ] ) , the set @xmath105 verifies properties ( i ) and ( ii ) stated in lemma  [ u ] , and also satisfies assumptions  [ sigma.a4 ] and  [ sigma.a2 ] .    under the above assumptions , the payoff functions @xmath89 and @xmath90 for the reduced zero - sum game become @xmath106 with these definitions , condition ( [ f = f ] ) reduces to the equation @xmath107 which admits real solutions if @xmath108 . also , condition ( [ df.df<0 ] ) reduces to the condition @xmath109 let @xmath110 the analysis of conditions ( [ f = f.lq ] ) , ( [ df.df<0.lq ] ) shows that only one of the solutions of equation ( [ f = f.lq ] ) , @xmath111 satisfies ( [ df.df<0.lq ] ) provided @xmath112    condition ( [ z.lau3a ] ) describes the region in the state space in which the jammer s optimal policy is to choose randomly between the channel @xmath27 currently in use and the most blocking channel @xmath69 . observe that in the case where the plant ( [ plant.lin ] ) is scalar and @xmath113 , we recover the exactly same condition as that obtained in  @xcite by direct computation . that is , theorem  [ saddle.point ] confirms the existence of the nontrivial optimal jammer s strategy for this region . we refer the reader to  @xcite for the exact value of the optimal vector @xmath114 ; the calculation for the multidimensional plant ( [ plant.lin ] ) follows the same lines , and is omitted for the sake of brevity . we also point out that the optimal controller s policy ( [ u * ] ) is nonlinear . hence , any linear feedback policy that controller may employ assuming that its signals are transmitted over a _ bona fide _ packet dropping channel will lead to an inferior control performance . we interpret this situation as a signature of a successful dos attack by the jammer . in this paper we have analyzed a class of control problems over adversarial channels , in which the jammer actively attempts to disrupt communications between the controller and the plant . we have posed the problem as a static game , and have given necessary and sufficient conditions for such a game to have a nontrivial saddle point . the significance of these conditions is to allow a characterization of a set of plant s initial states for which a dos attack can be mounted that requires a nontrivial controller s response . for instance , in the linear quadratic problem analyzed in the paper the optimal control law is nonlinear . this gives the jammer an advantage over any linear control policy in those problems . the jammer achieves this outcome by randomizing its choice of a packet - dropping channel rather than operating packet dropping facility directly .    on the other hand , the part of the state space where the jammer randomizes is determined by the jammer s cost of switching ( reward for not switching ) and transition probabilities of the current and the most blocking channels . if these parameters can be predicted / estimated by the controller , it has a chance of mitigating the attack by either eliminating those regions , or steering the plant so that it avoids visiting those regions . future work will be directed to further understanding conditions for dos attacks , with the aim to consider dynamic / multi - step control problems . another interesting question is whether associating a distinct payoff with one of the channels is necessary for the jammer to resort to randomization . e. garone , b. sinopoli , and a. casavola , lqg control over lossy tcp - like networks with probabilistic packet acknowledgements , international journal of systems , control and communications , vol . 55 - 81 , 2010 . a. gupta , c. langbort , and t. baar , optimal control in the presence of an intelligent jammer with limited actions , in proc . of 49th ieee conference on decision and control ( cdc ) , 1096 - 1101 , december 2010 . t. baar and y - w . wuh , a complete characterization of minimax and maximin encoder - decoder policies for communication channels with incomplete statistical description , ieee transactions on information theory , vol . 31 , no . 4 , 1985","The text discusses the concept of control over a communication channel, specifically in the context of adversarial channels, where a rogue jammer attempts to disrupt the communication link by actively jamming the signal.

"owing to typical astronomical timescales , a galaxy s spiral arms are often considered as a fixed pattern . so , too , for the numerous , tightly wound spiral waves detected in saturn s rings . in fact , both systems are dynamically active , with waves traveling away from resonant sites . this is manifest only in saturn s case , where a pair of moons  janus and epimetheus  occupy nearly identical orbits that are interchanged every 4 years , causing the resonance locations in the rings to skip back and forth by tens of km . since spiral density waves are initiated in saturn s rings at locations where ring particle orbits are in a lindblad resonance with a perturbing moon , the starting points of waves jump as well , allowing wave trains to interfere in complex ways @xcite . high - resolution images of the rings were obtained by the cassini spacecraft s imaging science subsystem ( iss ) on 2004  july  1 and on 2005  may  20/21 . the calibration and image processing of these data , resulting in a series of brightness scans with orbital radius , along with a catalog of important satellite gravitational resonances falling within the rings , are presented by ( * ? ? ? * hereafter ) . further analysis of these data , employing techniques derived from the wavelet transform , is presented by ( * ? ? ? * hereafter ) . examination of the cassini images to date shows that density waves raised by the co - orbitals are both unusual and variable in their morphology . in this paper , we describe a model that accounts for much of the observed structure . we proceed to use this model to predict the future morphology of selected waves at the times and locations of planned cassini observations , which we expect will test our predictions . , width=302 ] the orbits of janus and epimetheus about saturn constitute a form of the three - body problem of celestial mechanics that is unique in the solar system ( see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? when viewed in a rotating frame of reference , whose angular velocity equals the mass - weighted average of the mean motions of the two moons , epimetheus executes a modified `` horseshoe orbit '' encompassing janus slowly drifting @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 lagrange points ( fig . [ janepiorb ] ) . however , since epimetheus mass is not negligible compared to janus  the mass ratio is 0.278 @xcite  janus executes its own libration about the average orbit .    because the orbits of the two moons are so similar ( @xmath3  km ) , they are commonly known as the `` co - orbital satellites '' ( or , more briefly , the `` co - orbitals '' ) . every 4.00 years , they execute their mutual closest approach and effectively `` trade '' orbits , the inner moon moving outward and vice versa . the most recent reversal event occurred on 2006  january  21 , at which time janus became the inner satellite and epimetheus the outer . spiral density waves are raised in the rings at locations where ring - particle orbits are in a lindblad resonance with a perturbing saturnian moon . the density perturbations propagate outward from the resonance location . as reviewed in ( see also * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , five parameters characterize the idealized functional form of the perturbation : 1 ) the background surface density @xmath4 , which fixes the wavelength dispersion , 2 ) the resonance location @xmath5 , specifying a linear translation of the wave , 3 ) the wave s initial phase @xmath6 , 4 ) the damping parameter @xmath7 , indicating a characteristic distance over which the wave propagates before damping away , and 5 ) the wave s amplitude @xmath8 , which is proportional to the perturbing moon s mass .    considering only co - planar motions , the pattern speed of the resonant perturbation is described by positive integers @xmath9 and @xmath10 + 1 ; the first giving the number of spiral arms , and the second the order of the resonance ( first - order being strongest ) . a ( @xmath10 + 1)th - order lindblad resonance is generally labeled as @xmath11:@xmath12 .    at a given ring longitude @xmath13 , the initial phase of a particular density wave is @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the perturbing moon s mean longitude and longitude of periapse , respectively . although previous authors have usually analyzed spiral density waves in saturn s rings as static phenomena , in fact they propagate with a finite group velocity @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the radial ( epicyclic ) frequency of ring particle orbits , and @xmath19 is newton s gravitational constant . this is the speed at which information ( e.g. , effects of any change in the resonant forcing ) propagates . in the a  ring , @xmath20 is on the order of 10 - 20  km / yr . since spiral density waves commonly propagate over many tens of km , and the forcing from the co - orbital satellites changes every 4 yr , discontinuities resulting from reversal events should be observable in density waves raised by the co - orbitals . in the radial scans of ring brightness taken from cassini  iss images ( ) , spiral density waves due to the co - orbitals can be discerned at first - order , second - order , and third - order resonances . first - order waves ( e.g. , 2:1 , 4:3 , 5:4 , 6:5 ) were seen by voyager , and are some of the strongest waves in the ring system . however , non - linear effects , which occur when the density perturbations are comparable to the background surface density , greatly complicate their analysis @xcite . not only does the wavelength dispersion deviate significantly from linear theory , but simple superposition of multiple wave segments is not valid . second - order waves ( e.g. , 7:5 , 9:7 , 11:9 , 13:11 ) were first clearly resolved in the present cassini data set ( fig . [ jewaveimages ] ) . since the density perturbations comprising these weaker waves are much smaller than the background surface density , they remain well - described by linear theory , and overlapping wave segments can be simply superposed . accordingly , second - order waves are best - suited for comparison with our simple model , and we will focus exclusively on them .    additionally , several third - order co - orbital waves can be discerned through wavelet analysis of the radial scans ( ) ; however , these are too weak for much detailed structure to be resolved . our model is based on a simple assumption : when the co - orbital satellites are in a given configuration ( we ll call the janus - inward configuration `` je '' and the janus - outward configuration `` ej '' ) , spiral density waves propagate outward from the current lindblad resonance locations at the group velocity @xmath20 . when a reversal occurs ( e.g. , the satellites changing configurations from je to ej ) , the je resonance locations become inactive ; however , the waves previously generated there continue to propagate outwards , resulting in a `` headless '' wave . meanwhile , new `` tailless '' spiral density waves begin to propagate outward at a speed @xmath20 from the ej lindblad resonance locations .    , and from ej to je at @xmath21  yr ) . parameters are based on the 9:7 density wave , but here @xmath22 for all wave segments . in the right - hand column are wave segments created by janus in its inner ( purple ) and outer ( red ) configurations , and epimetheus in its inner ( blue ) and outer ( green ) configurations . only amplitudes larger than 1% are shown . dotted lines show the resonance locations , with the same color coding . the left - hand column shows the sum of the wave segments , which is the model prediction . [ jemodeldemo],width=604 ]    at any given time , the locations of `` headless '' and `` tailless '' wave segments can be easily calculated from @xmath20 and the elapsed interval since a reversal event . we simply superpose these wave segments atop one another to arrive at a predicted wave morphology ( fig . [ jemodeldemo ] ) . this time - domain approach to the problem is an alternative to the frequency - domain treatment of @xcite . we set the relative amplitude to unity for janus , and to the moons mass ratio of 0.278 for epimetheus . the relevant resonance locations are easily derived from the moons orbital parameters @xcite . the absolute navigation of iss images is not simple ( see ) ; nonetheless , all that is necessary for wave morphology is to know the separations among the resonance locations . the phase of each wave segment ( eq .  [ dwphase ] ) is determined by what the orbital parameters of the perturbing moon _ would have been _ had no reversal taken place . this is calculated using high - precision numerically - integrated orbits @xcite . we make a linear fit to @xmath15 and to @xmath16 over a single inter - reversal time period , then extrapolate forward to the observation time .    at the end of this process , the only remaining free parameters in our model are the background surface density @xmath4 and the damping parameter @xmath7 , which respectively control the wavelength dispersion and the propagation distance . we manually adjust these parameters to find the optimum agreement of feature locations between model and data .    for locations at which a wave segment begins or ends , an unrealistically sharp cutoff can occur . we soften such discontinuities by using a half - gaussian , with a characteristic width of 1  km , to bring the perturbation back to zero .    , and damping parameter @xmath7 are given in each figure . radial traces were taken from the following images : a ) n1467345385 , b ) n1495327885 , c ) n1467345916 , d ) n1495326975 , e ) n1495326431 . image resolutions are 250 m / pixel ( a , c ) and 1.4 km / pixel ( b , d , e ) . model resolution has been degraded to correspond to image resolution . [ jemodelresults],width=604 ] our model results are shown , along with corresponding cassini image traces , in fig . [ jemodelresults ] . we find good qualitative agreement between the two , especially in the `` upstream '' ( left - hand ) regions . there is also good agreement between model values of @xmath4 and @xmath7 and values for nearby waves in the a ring ( 9:7 , 11:9 ) and cassini division ( 7:5 ) ( ) . we assume that image n1467345916 ( fig . [ jemodelresults]c ) is in the reverse - contrast regime ( see ) . the most glaring failure of the model occurs in regions where the predicted perturbation is zero ( figs . [ jemodelresults]c and  [ jemodelresults]d ) . in such regions , the data instead show an oscillatory mode for which we can not account . it is possible that such oscillations could be raised in the several months during which the resonance locations are migrating from one configuration to the other , which we neglect in treating the reversals as instantaneous events . another potentially interesting explanation for such oscillations is that a leading spiral density wave may be propagating back towards the resonance location @xcite . this mode is allowed by the mathematical formalism , but has never been observed and has been considered impossible to excite ; however , it is conceivable that a `` headless '' wave could send such a mode into an otherwise undisturbed region .    , width=604 ] predictions of our model for the times and locations of cassini  iss observations designed to image the co - orbital waves @xcite are shown in fig . [ jemodelpredict ] . owing to the spacecraft s low orbital inclination so far this year , the main rings have not been observed at high resolution since the last reversal event ( from ej to je ) on 2006  january  21 , so the wave patterns in the new configuration have yet to be observed . we predict that the innermost wavecycles ( due to epimetheus in the ej configuration ) will become headless and shift outwards , while a blank gap ( possibly containing oscillations as in figs .  [ jemodelresults]c and  [ jemodelresults]d ) will appear between the new inner janus perturbation and the headless perturbation from the outer resonance location . the next reversal event , expected on 2010  january  21 , will be observable only if the cassini mission is extended beyond the current plan . saturn s rings are a nearby and accessible natural laboratory @xcite , in which we can observe phenomena of broader interest , such as how a disk responds to variable forcing . our model is a first step towards a new understanding of the observed complex and time - variable waveforms . we will revisit this topic in more detail , after the accuracy of our predictions ( at least for data that will be obtained this year ) becomes apparent . , c.  c. , west , r.  a. , squyres , s. , mcewen , a. , thomas , p. , murray , c.  d. , delgenio , a. , ingersoll , a.  p. , johnson , t.  v. , neukum , g. , veverka , j. , dones , l. , brahic , a. , burns , j.  a. , haemmerle , v. , knowles , b. , dawson , d. , roatsch , t. , beurle , k. , & owen , w. 2004 , space sci . rev . , 115 , 363","**Summary:**

The text discusses the detection of spiral density waves in Saturn's rings, which are caused by the gravitational interactions between the planet and its moons. The waves are observed to be dynamic and variable, with different wave patterns appearing at different times and locations. The text presents a model that accounts for the observed structure of the waves, which is based on the concept of a ""lindblad resonance"" between the moons and the planet.

"bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) in optical lattices ( ols ) are presently attracting a great deal of interest  @xcite due both to their flexibility in parameter design and to the possibility they offer to observe interesting phenomena such as superfluid to mott - insulator transition  @xcite , bloch oscillations @xcite , landau - zener tunneling  @xcite , generation of coherent atomic pulses ( atom laser )  @xcite , atom interferometry  @xcite , etc . in this respect , ols allow to control important properties of bec by means of their periodic structure , this allowing , for example , the existence and stability of localized nonlinear excitations with chemical potentials inside band - gaps ( so called gap - solitons ( gss ) ) even in the presence of repulsive interactions ( positive scattering lengths ) . this fact , that would be obviously impossible in absence of the ol @xcite , has been experimentally demonstrated in  @xcite . modulations of the ol can be used to accelerate , decelerate or to scatter gss as well as to control their velocities  @xcite . uniform accelerations of the ol combined with periodic modulations of the scattering length , either in space or in time , were shown to be effective tools to induce long  lived bloch oscillations in the nonlinear regime  @xcite , as well as band - gap tunneling phenomena such as the landau - zener tunneling @xcite . periodic time dependent ol accelerations were also used to achieve the dynamical localization of nonlinear matter waves  @xcite and the rabi - oscillations of gs states across a band - gaps  @xcite which survive on a long time scale in the presence of nonlinearity . moreover , the combination of the above phenomena permits the stirring of gss both in the reciprocal and in the direct lattice space as recently demonstrated in @xcite . besides the one - dimensional contexts in which these effects have been investigated , ols also play an important role for stabilizing gss against collapse or decay in higher dimensions  @xcite . all what said above refers to the case of perfect ols , e.g. ols without distortions or defects which compromise the periodicity structure . in this case the interplay between periodicity and nonlinearity is the only source for the localization of matter waves in the system . ol defects , however , introduce additional bound states in the band - gaps ( so called impurity modes ) @xcite providing an alternate source of localization in the system . opposite to gss , impurity modes exist both in absence and in presence of nonlinearity and can interfere in the scattering process of gss by ol defects . scattering properties of solitons with single ( non periodic ) potential wells have been extensively investigated during the past years . for the case of the nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nlse ) scattering of solitons by extended defects were numerically investigated in @xcite where the occurrence of a series of reflection , transmission , and trapping regions as a function of the defect strength was reported . a similar problem has been recently investigated for solitons of the gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) with rectangular potential wells and for attractive interatomic interactions @xcite . similar studies were also done for point defects of the discrete nlse equation @xcite which corresponds , under suitable conditions , to a tight  binding model of bec in a deep ol @xcite . the resonant transmission , reflection and trapping of discrete breathers by point - defects was investigated in @xcite . in contrast to these studies , however , the scattering of continuous gpe gss by ol defects have been scarcely investigated . in this context , we mention the numerical study performed in @xcite where the scattering properties of gss were suggested to be useful to construct quantum switches and quantum memories . to our knowledge , however , the mechanism underlying resonant transmissions of gpe gss by ol defects and the possibility of multiple defects resonant scattering have not yet been discussed .    in the present paper we provide an extensive numerical investigation of the scattering properties of gss by ol defects and identify the physical mechanism underlying the phenomenon of the resonant transmission . in particular , we show that the presence of repeated reflections transmission and trapping regions observed for increasing strengths of an ol defect is associated to the impurity modes inside the defect potential with energies ( chemical potentials ) and numbers of atoms matching corresponding quantities of the incoming gs . as the ol defect strength is increased , new impurity modes enter from the gap edges , moving toward the center of the gap ( bottom of the potential ) . this implies that for incoming gss with chemical potentials very close to band edges , the number of resonances observed in the scattering coincides with the number of bound states which can exist in the defect potential for the given defect strength . this fact is demonstrated both by studying stationary states inside the defect potential and by direct numerical integrations of the gpe . an excellent agreement between the two approaches is found , this confirming the correctness of our interpretation . the dependence of the resonant transmission on the incoming velocity of the gs is also investigated both for fundamental gss in the semi - infinite gap and for gss in the first gap zone . as a result we show that the transmission resonant peaks become wider as the incoming velocity is increased , with very sharp peaks at small velocities . the multiple resonant transmission through a series of ( two and three ) ol defects is also demonstrated . we show in this case that for equally spaced identical ol defects the widths of the full transmission resonances in general decreases as the number of defects is increased . we demonstrate , however , that the resonant transmission through a series of defects can be achieved if defects are designed so to compensate off - resonance detunings introduced by velocity changes . this fact gives rise to the possibility of using arrays of ol defects as very precise filters for matter wave dynamics . the paper is organized as follows . in sec . ii we present the model equation and discuss the basic properties of gss of the gpe . in the sec . iii we consider the interaction of small amplitude gss with a localized gaussian impurity in the ol . the problem is investigated by means of direct numerical integrations of the gpe for both attractive and repulsive interactions as well as for attractive and repulsive defects . in section iv we use a stationary defect mode analysis to show that the repeated resonant transmission , reflection and trapping regions occurs in correspondence of resonances with impurity modes inside the defect potential and investigate their dependence on gs incoming velocities . in section v the multiple resonant transmission across a series of equidistant ( equal and unequal ) ol defects , is investigated . in sect . vi the main results of the paper are shortly resumed . let us consider a cigar - shaped bec described by the following normalized one - dimensional gpe  @xcite @xmath0 where @xmath1 denotes an external potential of the form : @xmath2 , with @xmath3 a perfect ol of period @xmath4 : @xmath5 , and @xmath6 a defect potential consisting of a sum of @xmath7 single wells potentials localized on a distance of several lattice period around the ol sites @xmath8 , @xmath9 . in the following we assume @xmath10 and @xmath11 to have the form @xmath12 \label{defect}\end{aligned}\ ] ] where without loss of generality the period of the ol is taken @xmath13 . we remark that results of this paper will not qualitatively dependent on type of defect ( we used gaussian defects just for numerical convenience ) and similar results can be obtained for other shapes of the defects , like square well defects , for example ) . in the following we will mainly restrict to the cases of few ol defects : @xmath14 only . we also remark that in eq.([gp ] ) the normalization has been made by measuring the energy in units of recoil energy @xmath15 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the lattice constant , the space coordinate and time in units of @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively . the dimensionless macroscopic wave function is also normalized as @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the s - wave scattering length . it is well known that in the absence of the defect potential @xmath22 , eq.([gp ] ) posses families of exact gs solutions with energy located in the band - gaps of the linear eigenvalue problem @xmath23\varphi_{\alpha k}=0,\ ] ] where @xmath24 are orthonormal set of bloch functions with @xmath25 denoting the band index and @xmath26 the crystal - momentum inside the first brillouin zone ( bz ) : @xmath27 $ ] . it is also known that small - amplitude gss with chemical potentials @xmath28 very close to band edges are of the form @xmath29 with the envelope function @xmath30 obeying the following nlse @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are slow temporal and spatial variables , @xmath34 denotes the soliton effective mass and @xmath35 the effective nonlinearity @xcite . the condition for the existence of such solitons is @xmath36 and coincides with the condition for the modulational instability of the bloch wavefunctions at the edges of the bz @xcite . examples of small amplitude gss with chemical potential inside the band - gap structure are depicted in fig . [ fig_e(k ) ] .    in the presence of very diluted ol defects , gss will continue to exist and away from defects they practically coincide with gss of the undistorted ol . an attractive ( local potential well ) or repulsive ( local potential barrier ) ol defect will be seen by the gss differently , depending on the sign of their effective mass . thus , for example , in the case of repulsive interactions and a negative effective mass , a gs approaching a repulsive defect will see it as a trapping potential ( rather than as a potential barrier ) , thus besides being totally or partially transmitted / reflected , it can also be trapped at the defect site , a fact which would be impossible in absence of the ol . in all the numerical simulations presented in this paper we have used stationary gss of eqs . ( [ gp])([defect ] ) , exactly determined by the shooting method @xcite or by self - consistent calculations @xcite , and have put them in action by means of phase imprinting ( e.g. we multiply the state by the phase factor @xmath37 , with @xmath38 being the gs velocity ) . this provides initial condition for the gpe numerical time integration of the form : @xmath39 . for possible experimental implementations of our results , an alternate method to use to put the gs in action could be the acceleration of the ol for a short time interval to move the stationary state away from the bz edges ( center ) so that it can acquire a small bloch velocity @xmath40 ( for details on how this can be done see @xcite ) . we consider first the scattering of a gs by a single localized defect ( @xmath41 in eq . ( [ defect ] ) ) . in order not to perturb the soliton initially , the distance between the soliton center and the ol defect is taken much larger than the width of the gs ( @xmath42 ) . in the following we compute the trapping , transmission and reflection coefficients defined as @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , with @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 denoting the numbers of atoms trapped , transmitted and in the initial state , respectively . the final time @xmath49 depends on the initial velocity of the gs and in the numerical experiment is determined as the time necessary for the coefficients @xmath50 to become stationary after the scattering process has occurred . the trapping region @xmath51 $ ] has the size of the initial soliton and in all our calculations we fix @xmath52 .      for the scattering of a gs in the semi - infinite gap to occur , the existence criterion for a gs near the bottom edge of the first band ( where the effective mass is positive ) implies that the nonlinear coefficient must be negative sign@xmath53 .    by applying a small initial velocity to the gs in the defect direction , depending on the amplitude @xmath54 and width @xmath55 of the defect , three possible scenarios can occur : i ) complete reflection , @xmath56 ; ii ) complete transmission , @xmath57 ; iii ) partial trapping , @xmath58 . the regions of the parameter space @xmath59 where these different regimes occur , as obtained from direct numerical integration of eq.([gp ] ) , are reported in fig . [ eta(d)_w-0125_v005 ] . the dependence of @xmath60 on the defect strength @xmath54 for two different incoming gs velocities and for a fixed value of the defect width @xmath61 is depicted in fig . we see that by changing the strength of the defect it is possible to achieve complete reflections ( @xmath62 ) or transmission ( @xmath63 ) as well as partial trappings ( @xmath58 ) . the profiles of the initial , reflected and transmitted gs are depicted in the top panels of fig.[fig3 ] for defect strengths corresponding to points labeled in the middle panel by letters a , b , c. by comparing the middle and the bottom panels of fig.[fig3 ] it is clear that the sharp peaks at small incoming velocities ( @xmath64 ) for which @xmath63 ( see points a , c , e , f , g in the middle panel ) become wider as the velocity is increased while the regions for which @xmath62 are a bit reduced ( also see fig.[fig3_transm_0.475 ] for the case of first band - gap gss ) . the first four impurity modes corresponding to the transmission peaks @xmath65 in the middle panel of fig.[fig3 ] have been depicted in fig . [ modes_fig3 ] . notice the alternating odd - even symmetry of these modes ( modes d and f being odd and modes e and g being even with respect to the center @xmath66 of the defect potential ) as usual for eigenstates of one - dimensional trapping potentials . we remark that the existence of four resonant transmission peaks ( and reflection regions ) seen in fig.[fig3 ] for @xmath67 correlates with the existence of four impurity modes for the given defect strength region ( see stationary defect mode analysis below ) . similar results as those of the previous section can be found for gss inside the first band - gap , with the only difference that now there are two possibilities for the existence of small - amplitude solitons : i ) in the vicinity of the top edge of the first band where the effective mass is negative and therefore gss can exist only for repulsive interactions @xmath68 ; ii ) and in the vicinity of the bottom edge of the second band where effective mass is positive and gs exist only for attractive interactions @xmath69 . the small - amplitude gs near the first band - gap edges b , c , in fig.[fig_e(k ) ] are shown by the corresponding profiles @xmath70 and @xmath71 depicted in the figure .    as remarked before , the sign of the effective mass determines the type of the interaction of the gs has with the defect potential and for negative gs effective mass ( repulsive interatomic interactions ) the defect will be seen as a defect trapping potential ( supporting therefore bound states ) if the defect strength @xmath54 is positive rather than negative ( as seen for the case of a positive effective mass ) . except for this , results go in parallel with those of the previous section and have been collected in figs.[fig3_transm_0.475 ] , [ fig3_transm_0.475_v ] for the case of an initial gs close the top edge of the first band ( negative effective mass ) . in particular , from the bottom panel of fig . [ fig3_transm_0.475 ] and fig . [ fig3_transm_0.475_v ] we clearly see that for a fixed defect width the region of the resonant transmission ( corresponding to red color ) becomes wider as the incoming gs velocity is increased , while the full reflected regions are achieved mainly for small velocities , as one could have expected . we remark that also in this case the number of resonant transmission reflection and trapping regions are found to correlate with the number of impurity modes present in the defect potential for the given range of the defect strength ( first four modes corresponding to the maxima of the trapping coefficient c in fig.[fig3_transm_0.475 ] are depicted in fig.[fig3_transm_0.475_modes ] , [ modes_fig4_0475 ] ) . as remarked before , the presence of a repulsive ( attractive ) ol defect in the gpe affects the existing gs states for @xmath72 and introduces additional localized states inside the gap in presence of repulsive ( attractive ) nonlinearities . numerical calculations show that the band structure is only slightly affected by an ol impurity , the main effect being the introduction of bound states spatially localized at the impurity sites and with chemical potentials inside the band - gap . note that repulsive ( attractive ) ol defects in the presence of an attractive ( repulsive ) nonlinearity can not introduce additional bound states because the corresponding impurity potentials correspond to barriers rather than potential wells , due to the positive ( negative ) effective mass . recalling that the opposite signs of nonlinearity and effective mass is a necessary condition for the gs existence , one has that the effective impurity potential acts as a trapping potential when @xmath54 and @xmath73 have equal signs . away from the ol impurity localized states are practically the same as for @xmath72 case . at the defect site , however , gss levels get slightly shifted by the impurity potential and additional impurity modes enter the gap . a gs moving through the impurity will have , in general , a mismatch in energy and in number of atoms with the impurity modes , this giving a partial reflection / transmission of the incoming matter wave . a total transparency of the ol defect is expected for incoming gs energies and number of atoms exactly matching those of an impurity modes inside the defect potential ( notice that the energy of impurity modes depend on @xmath54 and on the number of atoms ) . by increasing the strength of the impurity , the depth of the defect potential increases and more impurity modes enter the gap . as @xmath74 is increased , the energies of these modes enter the gap from the top ( bottom ) of a band for impurity strength and the nonlinearity both positive ( negative ) . this implies that the transparency ( complete transmission ) of the impurity occurs in correspondence of each impurity mode entering the gap and matching the energy of the incoming gs given by @xmath75 where the first term @xmath76 represents the energy of the stationary gs state at @xmath77 ( eg . with @xmath78 ) , while the second one is the contribution due to the kinetic energy ( here @xmath79 is the bloch velocity and @xmath80 the effective mass ) . for small velocities the energy ( [ energyshift ] ) practically coincides with @xmath76 but in general the kinetic term should be accounted in the matching in energy with the impurity levels ( see below ) . notice that eq . ( [ energyshift ] ) is only valid near stationary points @xmath81 ( bottoms or tops of a band ) where @xmath82 and @xmath83 can be written as @xmath84 in the range of initial velocities @xmath85 $ ] we have considered , the energy curves @xmath86 in vicinity of @xmath87 and @xmath88 are very well approximated by eq . ( [ energyshiftapprox ] ) with @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 and @xmath92 for bottom and top edges of the band , respectively .    by knowing @xmath93 ( e.g. @xmath26 ) and @xmath94 one can compute the energy shift due to the nonzero velocity to be accounted in the matching between the gs and the impurity levels ( see lower panels of figs . [ modes_fig4_-0125 ] , [ modes_fig4_0475 ] ) . notice that the kinetic energy has the sign of the effective mass so that @xmath83 is pushed forward the corresponding band edge for finite @xmath93 , meaning that inside the impurity potential the gs matching condition with an impurity mode can be achieved for a lower values of @xmath74 . from this we expect the resonance transmission peaks to be shifted away from the @xmath95 resonance toward lower values of @xmath74 as @xmath93 is increased .    to confirm these prediction with gpe calculations we have solved the stationary problem @xmath96u-\sigma u^3=0\end{aligned}\ ] ] searching for bound states @xmath97 localized at the ol defect using both shooting method and self - consistent calculations . using these approaches we found that the values of @xmath54 for which the gaussian defect becomes transparent to the gs dynamics , correspond to the values for which a localized mode inside the defect potential has energy and number of atoms matching the corresponding quantities of the incoming gs . since the discussion is very similar ( a part implications due to signs of the effective masses ) for gs of the semi - infinite and for the ones inside finite - gaps , we refer to the case of an initial gs inside the semi - infinite gap , with a positive effective mass with chemical potential close to the bottom of the first band .    in the top panel of fig.[modes_fig4_-0125 ] we have shown the dependence of the number of atoms @xmath98 in a defect mode of a given symmetry on @xmath54 , for an energy @xmath99 corresponding to a gs with zero incoming velocity ( point a of figs . [ fig_e(k ) ] , [ fig3 ] ) . the horizontal dotted line refers to the numbers of atoms in the initial gs . in the bottom panel of fig . [ modes_fig4_-0125 ] we show the energy mismatch @xmath100 between the energy of a defect modes @xmath83 and the one of an incoming gs given by eq . [ energyshiftapprox ] for different incoming velocities . notice that the intersection points @xmath101 of the dotted line @xmath102 with the curves @xmath103 are in coincidence with the zeros of the function @xmath100 displayed in the bottom panel for @xmath64 and correspond to the maxima of the transmission coefficient @xmath104 in fig.[fig3 ] ( see curves @xmath64 in the middle panel ) . [ modes_fig4_-0125 ] ( see also [ modes_fig4_0475 ] for repulsive case ) also explains the decay of the reflection coefficient and the rising of the trapping coefficient coinciding up to the maxima observed ( just before the resonance ) for increasing values of @xmath74 away from the resonance points @xmath101 . to the right of these points in fig.[modes_fig4_-0125 ] , the number of particles in the defect mode is higher then the number of particles in the incoming soliton @xmath105 . in this case the gs can not `` use '' a defect mode to pass the ol impurity and will be fully reflected . on the left of the resonance points , the number of atoms in the gs is higher than the one in the defect mode so that the gs can be captured by the ol impurity by releasing the excess number of atoms into the reflection and transmission channels . it is clear that the peak of the capture coefficient occurs just before the resonant transmission ( e.g. for @xmath106 ) of the gs through the defect ( achieved when the condition @xmath107 is exactly fulfilled ) . notice from fig.[modes_fig3 ] that at the resonant transmission , the profiles of the stationary impurity modes obtained by solving eq.([matheiu_def ] ) exactly coincide with the solution of the gpe during the passage trough the defect . in fig.[-0125_odd_even_eta(d ) ] we have also depicted , similarly to fig.[eta(d)_w-0125_v005 ] , the level curves @xmath102 as a function of the amplitude @xmath54 and the width @xmath55 of the defect .    from the bottom panel of fig . [ modes_fig4_-0125 ] it is also clear that for @xmath108 the resonances shift in the direction of lower values of @xmath74 ( as expected from our analysis ) . this well correlates with the gpe calculations reported in the bottom panel of fig.[fig3 ] . similar results are obtained for a gs near the bottom of the first band gap ( point b in fig . [ fig_e(k ) ] ) for the case of repulsive interactions . this is shown in fig.[modes_fig4_0475 ] . from which we see that the shift of the resonance due to the finite bloch incoming velocity is always in the direction of lower values of @xmath54 and are in good agreement with the gpe numerical results reported in the bottom panel of fig . [ fig3_transm_0.475 ] . in particular , for the velocity @xmath109 and the resonance near @xmath110 we obtain from fig . [ modes_fig4_0475 ] that the resonance peak is at @xmath111 while from the gpe result in fig . [ fig3_transm_0.475 ] we obtain the value @xmath112 . it is also worth to note from the bottom panels of figs . [ modes_fig4_-0125 ] , [ modes_fig4_0475 ] , that for a fixed energy mismatch the widths of the curves increase as the incoming velocity is increased , a fact which correlates with the broadening of the transmission peaks observed in the gpe calculations ( compare bottom panels in fig . [ fig3 ] and in fig [ fig3_transm_0.475 ] , respectively ) .    from this we conclude that the above impurity mode analysis fully confirms the interpretation of the transmission peaks as resonances between incoming gss and impurity modes . an interesting question to ask is whether the soliton resonant transmission could survive multiple impurity scatterings . in fig . [ fig10 ] we show the transmission , reflection and trapping regions of an attractive gs of the gpe with two identical gaussian ol impurities , placed at @xmath66 and @xmath113 , respectively . the tcr curves depend also on the distance between the two impurities and this could be varied so to find optimal values for double resonant transmission to occur . the phenomenon , however , is more sensitive to variations of the incoming gs velocity as one can see by comparing fig.[fig10 ] with the case of single impurity in fig . [ fig3 ] . notice that while the transmission resonance peaks at small velocities are practically unaffected by the presence of the second impurity , they become more narrow at larger velocities for the resonant scattering on two impurities . the shrinking of the resonances at larger velocities can be understood by the fact that for higher incoming velocities the velocity of the gs after the first impurity is slightly reduced and the variation introduces a detuning from resonance in the scattering with the second impurity which in turn reduces the double resonance width . from this one can expect that in the presence of more lattice defects the multiple resonance transmission peaks become very narrow and only solitons with very precise initial matching velocities will be able to pass . in general the gs may be able to pass only a finite number of impurities before remaining trapped at one impurity or becoming scattered back and forth between them . this is shown in fig.[fig11 ] where contour plots of the gs space - time dynamics in presence of two identical gaussian defects are reported for different strengths @xmath54 and for the same parameters as for the bottom panel of fig.[fig10 ] . in the left top and bottom panels we see the occurrence of total reflection and transmission for a resonant value of @xmath54 while in the corresponding right panels we show the back and forth dynamics of the soliton between two impurities ( top panel ) and the trapping by the second impurity ( top panel ) for a non resonant values of @xmath54 . notice the small change of the soliton velocity after the passage through the first defect . to overcome the detuning from resonance induced by the change of velocity one could design the strength of the second impurity so to match the value of the intermediate velocity and still achieving @xmath63 . in this way one can realize a double ( or multiple ) filtering of the soliton motion so that only gss having very precise initial velocity can overcome the defect series .    this possibility is illustrated in fig . [ fig12 ] where the resonant transmission of a gs though a series of three gaussian defects of the ol , with defect strengths designed so to compensate the detunings introduced by the velocity changes , is shown . notice from the left panel of fig . [ fig12 ] that in the case of equal defects with the initial velocity matching the resonance transmission peak of the first defect , the gs can not be transmitted through all the three defects but it is stopped at the second defect . the dynamics of the soliton in presence of multiple defects may be quite complicated and is beyond the aim of this work ( an investigation in the parameter space of the possible scenarios for the gs time evolution will be discussed elsewhere ) . in this paper we have investigated the scattering properties of matter wave gap - solitons with optical lattice defects in the framework of the mean - field gross - pitaevskii equation . we have shown that the occurrence of repeated reflection , transmission and trapping regions are in correspondence of the defects strengths for which the number of atoms and energies of additional bound states created by the optical lattice defect , match the ones of the incoming gap - soliton . this has been demonstrated by a study of the stationary defect modes energies ( chemical potentials ) and number of atoms as a function of the defect strength . a very good agreement between the predicted values of the resonant transmission peaks by means of impurity modes and the ones found by direct time integrations of the gross - pitaevskii equation , is found . the behavior of the reflection and trapping curves have also been explained by impurity mode analysis . these investigations have been performed both for attractive and repulsive interactions and for localized states both in the semi - infinite gap ( attractive case ) and in the first gap zone ( attractive and repulsive cases ) . the dependence of the resonant transmission on the initial gap - soliton velocity has been also investigated . we have shown that the positions of resonant transmission peaks shift toward lower values @xmath74 as the initial gap - soliton velocity is increased , while the widths of resonances shrinks to zero at very small gap - soliton velocities . the possibility of multiple resonant transmission through an arrays of defects was also demonstrated . in particular , we have shown that for an optical lattice with two equally spaced identical gaussian defects the widths of the full transmission resonances for larger incoming velocities , decreases as the number of defects is increased . the sharpening of the transmission peaks has been explained in terms of the detuning from resonance introduced by the small velocity change after the passage of an optical lattice defect . finally , the resonant transmission of a gap - soliton though a series of gaussian defects with unequal strengths designed so to compensate detunings introduced by the velocity changes , was demonstrated . these results give the possibility to construct very precise filters for the matter wave gap - soliton dynamics by means of properly designed arrays of ol defects . v.a.b . acknowledges support from the fct grant , ptdc / fis/64647/2006 . ms acknowledges the miur ( prin-2008 initiative ) for partial financial support . see review papers o. morsch and m. oberthaler , rev . phys . * 78 * , 179 ( 2006 ) and references therein ; i. bloch , j. phys . b * 38 * , s629 .

 the occurrence of repeated reflection , transmission and trapping regions for increasing strengths of an optical lattice defect are shown to be due to impurity modes inside the defect potential with chemical potentials and numbers of atoms matching corresponding quantities of an incoming gap - soliton . for gap - solitons with chemical potentials very close to band edges , 
 the number of resonances observed in the scattering coincides with the number of bound states which can exist in the defect potential for the given defect strength . 
 the dependence of the positions and widths of the transmission resonant on the incoming gap - soliton velocities are investigated by means of a defect mode analysis and effective mass theory . 
 the comparisons with direct integrations of the gross - pitaevskii equation provide a very good agreement confirming the correctness of our interpretation . the possibility of multiple resonant transmission through arrays of optical lattice defects is also demonstrated . 
 in particular , we show that it is possible to design the strength of the defects so to balance the velocity detunings and to allow the resonant transmission through a larger number of defects . the possibility of using these results for very precise gap - soliton dynamical filters is suggested .",32422,504,1452,25.75 seconds,7.39 MB,0.2945205479452055,0.0896551724137931,0.17123287671232876,0.8227813839912415,medium
"the crab nebula @xmath0-ray emission has been established as a standard candle for the @xmath0-ray astronomy ( e.g. meyer et al . this conclusion based mainly on the observations at energy ranges between @xmath1 mev and a few gev ( satellite telescopes ) and between @xmath1 gev and @xmath2 tev ( cherenkov telescopes ) . the theoretical interpretation of the emission from the crab nebula suggests that this may not be exactly the case . the @xmath0-ray spectrum is widely interpreted in the two component radiation model in which the lower energy emission is due to the synchrotron process and the higher energy emission results as a consequence of the inverse compton ( ic ) process . it has been argued that the ends of the synchrotron and ic components can flicker due to the non - stationary acceleration of leptons at the pulsar wind shock . first evidences of the variability of the end of synchrotron component has been reported based on the analysis of the egret data ( de jager et al . 1996 , ramanamurthy et al . 1995 ) . also situation has not been clear at the highest observer energies ( above @xmath2 tev ) , where some measurements seemed to be contradictory ( aharonian et al . 2004 , aharonian et al . 2006 ) . the spectrum from the crab nebula at energies 100 - 400 mev is very steep , with the differential spectral index close to 4 ( abdo et al . it cuts off at about @xmath1 mev , i.e. at clearly larger energies than previously reported @xmath3 mev cut - off derived from the egret measurements ( kuiper et al . 2001 ) . on the other hand , the @xmath0-ray spectrum at gev energies is very flat linking correctly with the tev spectrum measured by the cherenkov telescopes ( e.g. albert et al . unexpectedly , the agile telescope has recently reported an enhanced @xmath0-ray emission above @xmath4 mev from the crab nebula by a factor of 2 - 3 during september 19 - 21 , 2010 in respect to steady emission ( tavani et al . 2010 , 2011 ) . this observation has been confirmed by the fermi - lat telescope which observed enhanced @xmath0-ray emission during the interval september 18 - 22 , 2010 ( buehler et al . 2010 , abdo et al . the @xmath0-ray flux reached the value of @xmath5 ph . s@xmath7 above 100 mev . the flaring component has a differential spectral index @xmath8 and is coincident with the crab nebula . the flare consists from three separated enhancements lasting 6 - 12 hours ( balbo et al . the lack of pulsed emission suggests that the flare is probably related to the crab nebula rather than the pulsar ( hays et al . 2010 ) . the enhanced @xmath0-ray emission at about 1 tev has been also reported by the argo - ybj air shower array ( aielli et al . this flaring component extends up to september 27th 2010 , i.e. it lasts a few days longer than the 100 mev emission reported by the satellite telescopes . the flux measured during the time interval september 17 - 22nd , 2010 was about 3 - 4 time higher than usual . unfortunately , this enhanced emission has not been confirmed by the observations of the magic ( mariotti et al . 2010 ) and veritas collaborations ( ong et al . 2010 ) .    the increased optical emission about 3 arcsec east of the crab pulsar and from the wisp north - west of the pulsar has been reported by the hubble space telescope ( caraveo et al . this corresponds to the brightening of this same region in the x - rays as reported by the chandra observations ( tennant et al . however , other x - ray telescopes have not reported any significant change in the crab nebula spectrum and morphology ( sakamoto et al . 2010 , shaposhnikov et al . moreover , no any glitch of the crab pulsar has been noted during the last 60 days before the @xmath0-ray flare ( espinoza et al . 2010 ) .    in this paper we investigate the hypothesis that the variable @xmath0-ray emission above @xmath4 mev is due to the synchrotron radiation from electrons which are accelerated near the pulsar wind shock region to different maximum energies . we expect that variable gev @xmath0-ray emission should be accompanied by the variable @xmath0-ray emission above a few tev from the inverse compton process . discovery of such variable emission by the present cherenkov telescopes ( hess , magic , veritas ) and the future cherenkov telescope array ( cta ) will allow to constrain the physical processes at the acceleration site and investigate the connections between the pulsar and the nebula . note that recently komissarov & lyutikov  ( 2010 ) proposed the localization of the @xmath0-ray flare emission region with the compact inner knot , based on their recent results on relativistic mhd simulations of the crab nebula . the variability time scale of the @xmath0-ray emission on the level of days can be understood assuming that the emission comes only from a part of the pulsar wind shock . therefore , either only a small region of the axially symmetric pulsar wind shock is excited or the emission region is moving relativistically towards the observer . the axial symmetry of the pulsar wind ( with the axis parallel to the rotational axis of the pulsar ) is consistent with the observations of the jet - torus morphology of the crab nebula ( e.g. hester 2008 ) and with the mhd simulations of the pulsar wind structure ( komissarov & lyubarsky  2003 ) . the first hypothesis seems unlikely since the wisp regions have already extensions which are larger than the light travel distance scale corresponding to 3 - 4 day time scale variability . here we consider the second hypothesis in which the @xmath0-ray emission region is related to the shock region which still moves with substantial lorentz factor , @xmath9 , in the outward direction from the pulsar . this might be the region in the pulsar wind which is in the process of being decelerated at the pulsar wind shock region . it is expected that in this region efficient reconnection process of the pulsar wind magnetic field can occur . as a result , good conditions are produced for acceleration of particles to the highest possible energies . the first wisps in the crab nebula appear at the distance of @xmath10 cm from the pulsar ( caraveo et al . in fact , recent optical observations of the wisp confirm its variability which may be related to the observed @xmath0-ray variability by the agile and fermi . the observed day time scale @xmath0-ray variability allows to constrain @xmath9 . we assume that emission extends along the axially symmetric shock structure as observed in the crab nebula and expected from the mhd simulations ( komissarov & lyubarsky 2003 ) . the turbulence which arrive to the shock is relatively thin , i.e. it is thinner than the light crossing time scale multiplied by the lorentz factor of the emission region . the distant observer is able to detect emission only from a part of the shock with the opening angle @xmath11 ( see fig .  1 ) . based on such scenario we can estimate @xmath12 on , @xmath13 produced radiation is collimated within the angle @xmath11 for the lorentz factor of the shock of the order of , @xmath14 provided that the variability time scale of the @xmath0-ray emission is @xmath15 . in the case of the crab nebula shock with dimension @xmath16 cm , the minimum lorentz factor of the emission region should be of the order of @xmath17 where @xmath18 days . we conclude that for the sub - day time scale variability ( as observed in @xmath0-rays by the fermi - lat telescope , balbo et al . 2010 ) , the lorentz factor of the emission region in the shock has to be at least mildly relativistic . we suggest that the variable @xmath0-ray emission observed from the crab nebula comes from a part of the pulsar wind which is just behind the shock and still moves with relativistic velocities . 5.2truecm    we constrain the physical parameters of the emission region in the fluid frame ( in which the electric field vanishes ) based on the observations . this reference frame moves towards the observer with the lorentz factor @xmath19 . we consider relativistic electrons with characteristic lorentz factors @xmath20 in the fluid reference frame which are immersed in the perpendicular magnetic field with the strength in the fluid frame @xmath21 . the synchrotron spectrum from the crab nebula extends up to a hundred mev , showing a break at , @xmath22100 mev , during the quiescent stage ( abdo et al . this break can be related to a break in the electron spectrum according to , @xmath23 where the critical magnetic field is @xmath24 g , and @xmath25 is the electron rest mass . applying the above value for the break in the synchrotron spectrum , @xmath26 , we get the constraint on the product of the magnetic field strength within the emission region and the lorentz factor of radiating electrons , @xmath27 on the other hand , the @xmath0-ray flare observed by the agile and the fermi telescopes lasted for a few days and show a clear variability on a sub - day time scale , @xmath28 ( balbo et al . the duration of the flare has to be comparable ( or longer ) to the cooling time scale of electrons on the synchrotron process in the fluid frame , @xmath29 . by comparing these two time scales , we get the lower limit on , @xmath30 these two conditions allows us to estimate the magnetic field strength at the acceleration region in the fluid frame on , @xmath31 the magnetic field strength in the observer s frame is , @xmath32 . for the variability time scale observed by the fermi ( of the order of 0.5 day , balbo et al . 2010 ) , we obtain the lower limit on @xmath33 g , assuming that @xmath34 . the magnetic field as seen from the observer reference frame is estimated on @xmath35 g. on the other hand , a simple extrapolation of the magnetic field from the crab pulsar surface up to the location of the first optical wisps in the crab nebula allows to estimate their magnetic field strength . we assume a dipole magnetic field structure in the pulsar inner magnetosphere below the light cylinder radius , @xmath36 , and a toroidal structure in the pulsar wind , @xmath37 , where the surface magnetic field of the crab pulsar @xmath38 g , the light cylinder radius @xmath39 cm , @xmath40 g is the magnetic field strength at the light cylinder , the crab pulsar rotational period is @xmath41 ms , and @xmath42 is the velocity of light . the distance of the optical wisp from the pulsar is @xmath43 cm , estimated from the angular distance of 3 arcsec ( caraveo et al . 2010 ) , and for the distance to the crab nebula of 1650 pc . this wisp has been recently reported as showing optical variability . then , the magnetic field strength at the distance of the wisp is @xmath44 g. this estimate of the magnetic field fits well to the above estimate based on the variability time scale of the @xmath0-ray emission .    in any way , this lower limit is significantly larger than the magnetic field strength within the whole volume of the crab nebula estimated on @xmath45 g. such low values of the magnetic field has been already predicted based on the spherically symmetric mhd model developed by kennel & coroniti ( 1984 ) . they have been successfully applied in modelling of the multiwavelength non - thermal emission from the crab nebula in terms of the popular synchrotron self - compton model ( see e.g. , de jager & harding  1992 , atoyan & aharonian  1995 , or recently meyer , horns & zechlin  2010 ) . the discrepancy between the magnetic field values estimated for the inner wisp and the whole crab nebula can be naturally understood in terms of the recent axially symmetric mhd model discussed by komissarov & lyutikov  ( 2010 ) . in this model the observed features in the inner part of the crab nebula ( i.e. the inner knot and possibly also the wisp regions ) are created by parts of the pulsar wind shock which lays significantly closer to the pulsar than the equatorial part of the pulsar wind shock . therefore , the magnetic field strength at the considered by us the wisp region can be much stronger in respect to the whole nebula . the wisp region is quite extended but for the @xmath0-ray flaring might be responsible only a part of this region which is more directed towards the observer ( see fig  1 ) . the possible variability of the pulsar wind termination shock ( discovered in mhd simulations by camus et al .  2009 ) can be responsible for the change of conditions in the acceleration region directed towards the observer at the earth . in general , the variable emission at the gev energies observed from the crab nebula might be due to the change in the magnetic field strength at the acceleration site or the change of the plasma conditions which determines the acceleration process . its influence on the acceleration of particles is usually described by the so called acceleration parameter . we limit our considerations only to the second case since it is difficult to imagine situation in which the magnetic field , which source lays in the pulsar , can change significantly on a time scale of a few days in the pulsar wind . the problem is how electrons can be accelerated to considered energies in the classical acceleration processes in such a relatively strong magnetic field . in the case of the shock acceleration scenario or acceleration in a turbulent region , the maximum lorentz factors of electrons are limited by the synchrotron energy losses to @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the acceleration coefficient , and the magnetic field strength at the acceleration site is defined in the shock reference frame . it is scaled with @xmath48 g. this limit has been obtained from the comparison of the energy gains of electrons from the shock acceleration mechanism , @xmath49 , with their synchrotron energy losses , @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the energy of electrons , @xmath52 is the larmor radius of electrons , and @xmath53 is the thomson cross section . the maximum energies of synchrotron photons produced by electrons with the lorentz factors , @xmath54 , are independent on the magnetic field strength . they can be estimated from @xmath55 mev ( see eq . note that the maximum energies of synchrotron photons produced by electrons accelerated in the shock scenario can not exceed @xmath1 mev since @xmath56 . this is also true in the case of relativistic shocks if considered in the shock reference frame ( kirk & reville  2010 ) . however , in the case of relativistic shocks these maximum energies observed in the rest frame can be enlarged by the doppler factor of the shock as shown in the analytical calculations by achterberg et al . therefore , detection of synchrotron gev emission from the crab nebula requires that the emission region moves towards the observer with the doppler factor of the order of @xmath5710 , consistent with the lower limit estimated in sect .  2 . on the other hand , monte carlo simulations of the acceleration of particles by the first order fermi shocks propagating in a realistically modelled turbulent magnetic fields show that the process may not be efficient and the maximum energies of accelerated particles can be lower than expected in previous modellings ( niemiec & ostrowski  2004 , niemiec , ostrowski & pohl  2006 ) . another possibility , originally considered by coroniti ( 1990 ) and michel  ( 1994 ) , is the acceleration of electrons in the reconnection regions of the magnetic field in the pulsar wind before it reaches the shock region ( e.g. lyubarsky  1996 , lyubarsky & kirk  2001 , kirk & skjaeraasen  2003 ) . in the case of acceleration in the reconnection regions ( along the magnetic field lines ) , electron energy does not need to be limited by the synchrotron energy losses ( kirk 2004 ) . electrons are injected into the magnetic field of the pulsar wind zone producing synchrotron @xmath0-rays with energies overcoming the synchrotron energy loss limit on the shock acceleration process mentioned above .    due to the observed shape of the spectrum from the crab nebula , we assume that electrons reach the equilibrium spectrum which can be described by a differential power law spectrum with the characteristic cut - off at @xmath58 , @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the spectral index considered in the range 3.0 - 3.6 in order to be consistent with the observed synchrotron spectrum at energies below the break . electrons with such equilibrium spectrum produce synchrotron photons up to gev energies and also tev @xmath0-rays by scattering variety of soft radiation fields inside or close to their acceleration site . between them the best defined is the microwave background radiation ( mbr ) . the level of the soft synchrotron emission produced by low energy electrons fulfilling the whole crab nebula can not be so well defined in the region of the acceleration of electrons close to the pulsar wind shock . the reported variability of a hundred mev - gev @xmath0-ray emission from the crab nebula seems to be naturally interpreted as a result of the non - stationary acceleration of the end of the electron spectrum in the region when the pulsar wind interacts with the nebula . we propose that such emission variable on a short time scale likely comes from the region just behind the pulsar wind shock which still moves mildly relativistically . these electrons should produce synchrotron emission which sometimes can extend up to gev energies . on the other hand , these same electrons can produce also variable multi - tev @xmath0-rays as a result of the inverse compton scattering of the mbr and very low energy ( in radio range ) synchrotron radiation . 12.5truecm    we calculate the example spectra from the synchrotron process for different parameters of the electron spectra which potentially could be responsible for the observed variability of @xmath0-ray emission reported by the agile and the fermi telescopes . for these same parameters we also calculate the ic @xmath0-ray spectra in order to show how the end of ic spectrum should vary at energies above 1 tev . in the calculations we apply the full formulae from blumenthal & gould  ( 1970 ) . only the well defined soft photon target have been taken into account when calculating the ic spectra , i.e. the mbr and synchrotron radiation from the nebula . in the case of the synchrotron radio emission , we applied the observations of the crab nebula in the ghz energies ( baars & hartsuijker  1972 ) . the differential photon spectrum of this emission is well described by a single power law with spectral index 1.26 . this synchrotron differential photon density has been obtained by simple averaging over the whole volume of the nebula with the radius of 2 pc . we do not consider other possible low energy radiation fields such as the infrared radiation or the microwave radiation ( see . e.g. atoyan & aharonian  1996 ) . the photon densities of these other radiation fields is much more difficult to define preciously in the region of the pulsar wind shock . moreover their contribution to the total ic @xmath0-ray spectrum at multi tev region seems to be less important in respect to the comptonization of the mbr and the radio synchrotron photons ( e.g. atoyan & aharonian  1996 ) .    at first , we model the steady synchrotron spectrum and the flare synchrotron spectrum by changing the maximum energies of accelerated electrons and keeping constant the magnetic field strength at the acceleration region which is fixed on @xmath61 g. for this magnetic field strength electrons have to have lorentz factors @xmath62 , in order to be consistent with the observations of the cut - off in the synchrotron spectrum during the quiescent state ( see fig . we also calculate the @xmath0-ray spectra expected from electrons accelerated to maximum energies which might correspond to the emission during the recently observed flare , applying @xmath63 , and the supposed super - quiescent stage for which @xmath64 ( fig . electrons with the lorentz factors corresponding to the quiescent stage scatter the mbr almost in the klein - nishina ( kn ) regime since the energy of the mbr from the peak of the planck spectrum is equal to @xmath65 . on the other hand , scattering of synchrotron radio emission is regulated to the border between t - kn regimes , due to the power law spectrum of the synchrotron photons with the spectral index @xmath66 . the synchrotron and ic spectra are calculated for the two spectral indexes of electron spectrum , 3.0 and 3.6 ( see fig . 2a , b , respectively ) . as expected the @xmath0-ray emission produced by these electrons in the gev and tev energy ranges show clear correlations . however , the end of the tev @xmath0-ray spectrum from scattering of mbr and synchrotron radio emission vary on a lower level than the end of the synchrotron spectrum due to the ic scattering in ( or close to ) the klein - nishina regime . the change in the tev @xmath0-ray spectrum between the quiescent and flare states is substantial at energies above @xmath2 tev . moreover , the ic component , due to the scattering of the radio emission , is steeper and start to dominate at lower energies than the ic component from scattering of the mbr . the calculation of the level of the ic component from scattering of radio emission is less reliable due to the uncertain determination of the photon density of the radio synchrotron photons ( produced in the outer nebula ) in the region close to the pulsar shock .    in fig . 2c , we also show the @xmath0-ray spectra in the case of a very strong magnetic field at the emission region , equal to @xmath67 g , and a few values of the lorentz factor of electrons at the break of their spectrum . such strong magnetic field might appear as a result of the compression due to the decelerating pulsar wind . the lorentz factors of electrons , producing radiation in the quiescent stage , should be of the order of @xmath68 . then , the energies of the mbr photons at the peak of the spectrum are @xmath69 , i.e. the ics of the mbr occurs still in the t regime . therefore , the cut - offs in the ic spectrum calculated for the electron lorentz factors corresponding to the quiescent and flaring stages clearly show stronger variability . we propose that the variable emission from the crab nebula on a time scale of a few days , recently observed by the agile and the fermi telescopes above 100 mev , can be understood assuming that the emission region is moving mildly relativistically to the observer . we suggest that this @xmath0-ray emission comes from the region just behind the shock in the pulsar wind . it could be produced by electrons accelerated to different maximum energies in the electric fields induced during the reconnection process of the magnetic field under the pressure exerted by the shocked wind . these highest energy electrons produce synchrotron radiation in the mev - gev energy range and also the ic @xmath0-rays above @xmath70 tev by scattering of the mbr and the low energy synchrotron radiation . the relative role of these two soft radiation fields in the ics process is difficult to estimate due to the lack of precise knowledge on the density of the ghz radio photons at the acceleration site in the pulsar wind . we consider different parameters describing the spectrum of injected electrons and compare them with the observations in the mev - gev and above 1 tev energy ranges . the flaring stage might result either due to the change of the maximum energies of accelerated electrons ( described by their lorentz factors at the break of the power law spectrum ) or the the change of the spectral index of electrons at the highest energies , or by both effects . the change of only the break energy in the electron spectrum results in the tev @xmath0-ray ic spectra which show rather low level of variability at energies above @xmath2 tev . therefore , in such a case it will be difficult to observe synchronous variations at the gev and tev energies even with the future cherenkov telescope array ( see fig . the situation is more promising in the case of the instantaneous change of the break energy in the electron spectrum with the flattening of the electron spectrum . in such a case , the clear variability of the ic spectrum through the broad range of the tev energies could be detected . the possible discovery of flaring emission in the tev energies will be easier in the case of significantly stronger magnetic field at the acceleration region . then , the maximum energies of accelerated electrons can be lower and the ic scattering of the mbr could still occur in the thomson regime . as a result , the end of ic spectrum should change quadratically with the change of energy of electrons . the tev @xmath0-ray spectra calculated for the range of discussed parameters are compared with the best measurements of the crab nebula spectrum provided by the hegra ( aharonian et al . 2004 ) and the hess ( aharonian et al .  2006 ) . the hegra spectrum extends up to @xmath71 tev showing no evidences of the cut - off . on the other hand , the hess spectrum is steeper and shows a cut - off at clearly lower energies . calculated by us tev spectra from ic scattering of the mbr and synchrotron radio photons in the quiescent and flaring stages shows better consistency with the spectrum measured by the hegra collaboration ( aharonian et al . 2004 ) . the relatively steep tev @xmath0-ray spectrum reported by the hess collaboration ( aharonian et al . 2006 ) might be consistent with our calculations provided that it has been obtained during the stage of a relatively non - efficient acceleration of electrons and relatively strong magnetic field strength in the emission region . the sub - gev synchrotron @xmath0-ray emission during such stage should be on the level below the @xmath0-ray flux reported by the recent measurements by the fermi - lat telescope ( abdo et al . note however , that the @xmath0-ray emission reported by the egret telescope a decade ago ( e.g. kuiper et al . 2001 ) seems to be on the lower level than the present fermi - lat measurements . this suggest that the sub - gev emission from the crab nebula can vary not only up but also down in respect to the so called quiescent level observed by the fermi . the possible variability of the end of the tev @xmath0-ray emission from the crab nebula produced in the ics process by electrons may be partially hidden in the case of efficient acceleration of hadrons within the nebula . these hadrons , coming from the surface of the crab pulsar , could be also accelerated in the scenario discussed here . they interact with the matter within the crab nebula producing steady emission which is expected above @xmath2 tev , see e.g. amato et al .

The Crab Nebula is a complex object that consists of a pulsar, a type of neutron star, and a surrounding nebula. The pulsar is a rotating, highly magnetized neutron star that emits electromagnetic radiation, including X-rays and gamma rays, due to its strong magnetic field.

The Crab Nebula is a significant source","recently the agile @xmath0-ray telescope has reported the enhanced @xmath0-ray emission above 100 mev from the direction of the crab nebula during a period of a few days . 
 this intriguing observation has been confirmed by the fermi - lat telescope . 
 this emission does not show evidences of pulsations with the crab pulsar . 
 it seems that it originates at the shock region created as a result of the interaction of the pulsar wind with the nebula . 
 we propose that such variable @xmath0-ray emission originate in the region behind the shock when the electrons can be accelerated as a result of the reconnection of the magnetic field compressed by the decelerating pulsar wind . 
 the natural consequence of such interpretation is the prediction that the crab nebula @xmath0-ray spectrum produced by electrons as a result of the inverse compton scattering of soft radiation to multi - tev energies should also show synchronous variability on the time scales as observed at gev energies by the agile and fermi - lat telescopes . 
 we calculate how the end of the ic component of the crab nebula @xmath0-ray spectrum should look like during the quiescent and the flare gev @xmath0-ray emission . 
 we conclude that the variability of the multi - tev @xmath0-ray spectrum from the crab nebula might in principle be responsible for the differences between the spectral features reported by the hegra and hess collaborations at the multi - tev energies .

"following the proposal of paczyski ( 1986 ) , experiments to search for lensing - induced light variations of stars ( microlensing events ) located in the galactic bulge and the magellanic clouds have been or are being conducted by several groups ( macho : alcock et al . 1993 ; eros : aubourg et al .  1993 ; ogle : udalski et al . 1993 ; moa : bond et al .  2001 ; duo : alard & guibert 1997 ) . these experiments have successfully detected a large number of events ( @xmath12 ) , most of which are detected towards the galactic bulge .    despite a large number of event detections , the nature of the lenses is still poorly known . this is because the einstein ring radius crossing time @xmath13 ( einstein timescale ) , which is the only observable providing information about the physical parameters of the lens ( lens parameters ) , results from a combination of the lens parameters , i.e.@xmath14^{1/2},\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the einstein ring radius , @xmath16 is the lens mass , @xmath17 is the lens - source transverse speed , and @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the distances to the lens and the source from the observer , respectively . under this circumstance , the only approach one could pursue would be identifying the major lens population by statistically determining the lens mass function based on the observed timescale distribution . however , this approach requires _ a prior _ knowledge about the geometrical distribution of the lens , the lens kinematics , and the functional form of the lens mass function , which are all poorly known . in addition , even if all lensing objects were of the same mass , they would give rise to a broad range of timescale . as a result , it is difficult to identify the major lens population from this approach ( mao & paczyski 1996 ; gould 2001 ) . recently , from the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) images of one of the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) events ( macho lmc-5 ) taken 6.3 years after the original lens measurement , alcock et al . ( 2001 ) were able to resolve the lens from the lensed source star . by directly imaging the lens , they could identify that the event was caused by a nearby low mass star located in the galactic disk . besides the identification of the lens as a normal star , direct lens imaging is of scientific importance due to following reasons . first , by directly and accurately measuring the lens proper motion with respect to the source , @xmath20 , one can better constrain the physical parameters of the individual lenses . the previous method to determine @xmath20 is based on the analysis of the lensing light curves of events affected by the finite source effect , such as source - transit single lens events and caustic - crossing binary lens events ( gould 1994 ; witt & mao 1994 ; nemiroff & wickramasinghe 1994 ) . by analyzing the part of the light curves near the source transit or the caustic crossing of these events , one can measure the source star angular radius normalized by the angular einstein ring radius @xmath21 , i.e.  @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the angular source star radius . then , the lens proper motion is determined by @xmath24 for the proper motion determination by using this method , however , one should know the source star angular radius , which can only be deduced from an uncertain color - surface brightness relation . as a result , the proper motions determined in this way suffer from large uncertainties . by contrast , if the lens is resolved , the proper motion can be directly and thus accurately measured from the observed image . measuring the proper motion is equivalent to measuring the angular einstein ring radius because @xmath25 , where the event timescale is determined from the light curve . while @xmath13 depends on three lens parameters of @xmath16 , @xmath18 , and @xmath17 , @xmath21 does not depend on @xmath17 , and thus the lens mass can be better constrained . second , if the lens is resolved for an event where the lens - source relative parallax , @xmath26 , was previously measured during the lensing magnification , one can completely break the lens parameter degeneracy and the lens mass is uniquely determined by @xmath27 where @xmath28 ( gould 2001 ) . third , if the source of an event was resolved via either a source transit or a caustic crossing and thus @xmath29 was precisely measured , one can determine the angular source star radius by reversing the process of the classical method of the proper motion determination , i.e.   @xmath30 . by measuring @xmath23 , one can determine the effective temperature of the source star , which is important for the accurate construction of stellar atmosphere models ( e.g. , alonso et al . 2000 ) . although the first directly imaged lens was identified for an lmc event , much more numerous direct lens identifications are expected if high resolution followup observations are performed for events detected towards the bulge . there are several reasons for this expectation . first , compared to the total number of lmc events , which is @xmath31 , there are an overwhelmingly large number of bulge events . second , while the majority of lmc events are suspected to be caused by dark ( or very faint ) objects , most bulge events are supposed to be caused by normal stars , for which imaging is possible . third , an important fraction of lenses responsible for bulge events are believed to be located in the galactic disk with moderate distances , and thus more likely to be imaged due to their tendency of being bright and having large proper motions . the goal of this work is to estimate the fraction of galactic bulge events whose lenses can be directly imaged . for this estimation , we first compute the expected distribution of the lens - source proper motions of the currently detected galactic bulge events based on standard models of the geometrical and kinematical distributions of lenses and their mass function (   2 ) . we then apply realistic detection criteria for lens resolution and the result is presented as a function of the time elapsed after the original lensing measurement , @xmath0 (   3 ) . based on the result in   3 , we discuss some of the observational aspects of the future high resolution followup lensing observations aimed for direct lens imaging (   4 ) . we summarize the result and conclude in   5 . the first requirement for direct lens imaging is that the lens should have a large relative proper motion with respect to the source so that it can be widely separated from the lensed source star within a reasonable amount of @xmath0 . in this section , we , therefore , estimate the expected distribution of proper motions of galactic bulge events .    with the models of the lens mass function , @xmath32 , the matter density distributions of the lens and source stars along the line of sight towards the galactic bulge field , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , and the kinematical distribution of lens - source transverse velocities , @xmath35 , the distribution of lens proper motions of galactic bulge events is computed by @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the components of the transverse velocity which are respectively parallel with and normal to the galactic disk plane , @xmath39 is the detection efficiency of events as a function of @xmath13 , and the notation @xmath40 represents the dirac delta function . we note that the factors @xmath17 and @xmath15 are included in equation ( 4 ) to weight the event rate by the transverse speed and the lensing cross section .    for the galactic bulge and disk matter density distributions , we adopt the models of dwek et al . ( 1995 ) and bahcall ( 1986 ) , respectively . in the bulge model , the bulge has a triaxial shape and the matter density is represented by an analytic form of @xmath41 ^ 2+(z'/z_0)^4,\ ] ] where @xmath42 kpc , and the coordinates @xmath43 represent the axes of the triaxial bar from the longest to the shortest , and the longest axis is misaligned with the line of sight toward the galactic center by an angle @xmath44 . the bahcall disk model is expressed by a double exponential form of @xmath45,\ ] ] where the radial scale length and the vertical scale height are @xmath46 pc and @xmath47 kpc , respectively .    for the transverse velocity distribution , we adopt the model of han & gould ( 1995 ) . in this model , the velocity distributions for both disk and bulge components have a gaussian form of @xmath48 , \qquad i \in y,\ z.\ ] ] the means and the standard deviations of the individual velocity components for events with disk lenses and bulge source stars ( disk - bulge events ) are @xmath49 where @xmath50 corresponds to the rotation speed of the galactic disk and @xmath51 are the adopted velocity dispersions of stars in the solar neighborhood . for events with bulge source stars lensed by another foreground bulge stars ( bulge self - lensing events ) , the means and standard deviations of the transverse velocity distributions are @xmath52 for the barred bulge , the velocity dispersions along the axes of the bar are deduced from the tensor virial theorem ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) , resulting in @xmath53 @xmath54 . due to the projection effect caused by the bar misalignment , the projected velocity dispersions are computed by @xmath55^{1/2 } , \sigma_{z'})= ( 82.5 , 66.3)\ { \rm km}\ { \rm s}^{-1}$ ] , which correspond to the standard deviations in ( 9 ) . we note that the adopted velocity model is a rough approximation in the sense that it does not include factors such as the systematic mean motion of bulge stars discussed by evans & belokurov ( 2002 ) , the figure rotation of the bulge discussed by blum ( 1995 ) , and the possibility of non - gaussian nature of disk star velocity distribution discussed by evans & collett ( 1993 ) , which may actually be important in the resulting distribution of proper motions . since the inclusion of the mean motion or the figure rotation of bulge stars result in high proper motions , we note that the fraction of resolvable lenses predicted by the adopted bulge velocity model is the lower limit . the einstein timescale distribution of events observed by the macho group is claimed to be consistent with the distribution from normal stars ( alcock et al . 2000b ) . we , therefore , model the mass function of lenses based on the present day main - sequence stars determined by kroupa , tout & gilmore ( 1993 ) . the adopted mass function has a three power - law functional form of @xmath56 for the detection efficiency , we adopt the latest determination of the macho experiment ( alcock et al . 2000b ) , whose data were analyzed by using the ` difference image analysis ' method . = 12.0 cm -0.5 cm    -0.2 cm    = 12.0 cm -0.2 cm    in figure 1 , we present the obtained distributions of relative lens - source proper motions for disk - bulge ( solid curve ) and bulge self - lensing ( dashed curve ) events , respectively . due to the large uncertainties in the geometrical and kinematical distributions of lenses , the relative contribution of the disk and bulge lenses to the total event rate is very uncertain . we , therefore , leave the proper motion distributions of the disk - bulge and bulge self - lensing events separately , instead of estimating the distribution of total events by arbitrarily normalizing the ratio between the two populations of events . from the figure , one finds that , as expected , the average proper motion of events caused by disk lenses is larger than that of events caused by bulge lenses . the lens detectability is additionally restricted by the lens brightness . this is not only simply because the lens should be brighter than a detection limit , but also because the threshold lens - source separation for lens detection , @xmath57 , varies depending on the apparent lens / source flux ratio . therefore , we compute the angular threshold as a function of the magnitude difference between the lens and the source , @xmath58 .    for the computation of @xmath59 , we first model the point - spread - function ( psf ) of a stellar image as a gaussian , where the standard deviation @xmath60 of the psf characterizes the resolving power of the instrument to be used for followup lensing observations . we then generate the combined image of the lens and the source by normalizing such that the volume under each psf is proportional to the flux of each star . once the combined image is constructed , we then judge whether the lens and the source can be resolved each other . for this judgment , we assume that the lens can be resolved if the sign of the derivative of the combined image s one - dimensional psf profile changes more than two times in the overlapping region between the centers of the lens and the source images ( see figure 2 for illustration ) . then , the angular threshold is defined as the lens - source separation at which the lens is just to be resolved from the source star .    in figure 3 , we present the computed angular threshold as a function of @xmath61 . the two curves correspond to the distributions expected when the followup observations are carried out by using two different instruments , whose resolving powers are characterized by @xmath62 ( dashed curve ) and @xmath63 ( solid curve ) , respectively . we note that the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) recently installed on hst can achieve a resolution of @xmath64 . we also note that the near infrared camera ( nircam ) of _ next generation space telescope _ ( ngst ) , which will have an aperture of 6  7 m , will be sensitive in the wavelength range of 0.6 to 5 microns , and thus can achieve @xmath65 . from the figure , one finds that as the lens becomes fainter , it becomes difficult to resolve the lens from the source star . = 12.0 cm -0.5 cm    -0.2 cm    with the computed distribution of @xmath59 , we recalculate the distribution of proper motions of events by using equation ( 4 ) , but in this time only for events with detectable lenses . to be detected , the lens should meet the condition of @xmath66 . in addition , we also restrict that detectable lenses should be brighter than a threshold magnitude of @xmath67 . for this computation , we assume that the source star has a fixed brightness of @xmath68 , which corresponds to that of a bulge clump giant , while the lens brightness is deduced from its mass by using the mass - luminosity relation provided by kroupa , tout & gilmore ( 1993 ) . once the absolute magnitudes of the source and the lens are set , their apparent magnitudes are computed considering their distances from the observer , i.e.  @xmath19 for the source and @xmath18 for the lens . = 12.0 cm -0.5 cm    -0.2 cm    in figure 4 , we present the finally determined fractions of events with detectable lenses as a function of @xmath0 . in the figure , the thick and thin curves represent the expected fractions when followup observations are conducted by using instruments with @xmath7 and @xmath69 , respectively . if the instrument has a resolution of @xmath1 , we estimate that lenses can be resolved for @xmath2 and @xmath3 of disk - bulge events and for @xmath4 and @xmath5 of bulge self - lensing events after @xmath6 and 20 years , respectively . the fraction increases substantially with the increase of the resolving power . if followup observations are performed by using an instrument with @xmath7 , we estimate that lenses can be resolved for @xmath8 and @xmath9 of disk - bulge events and for @xmath10 and @xmath11 of bulge self - lensing events after @xmath6 and 20 years , respectively . in the previous section , we estimated the fraction of galactic bulge events for which one can directly image lenses from followup observations by using high resolution imaging instruments and presented the result as a function of a time after original lensing measurements . in this section , based on the result in the previous section we discuss some of the observational aspects of the future followup lensing observations aimed for direct lens imaging .    first , from the distributions in fig .  4 , we find that the proper choice of the instrument for the future high resolution followup lensing observations will be ngst . bulge events has been reported since 1993 ( udalski et al . 1994 ; alcock et al . 1995a ) . under a rough assumption that disk - bulge and bulge self - lensing events equally contribute to the total galactic bulge event rate and considering the life expectancy of hst , the fraction of events with resolvable lenses from hst observations will be just @xmath70 even if the followup observations are performed at the end stage of hst for the first generation of lensing events . however , by using ngst , which is scheduled to be launched in 2009 , it will be possible to resolve lenses for a significant fraction of events . second , given that all lensing events will be unable to be followed up due to the limited observation time of ngst , priority of targets should be given to events from which one can obtain extra information about the lens or the source star other than the identification of the lens as a normal star and the measurement of the lens - source proper motion . as mentioned in   1 , one can measure the angular radius of the source star of an event , for which the source was previously resolved , and uniquely determine the lens mass of an event , for which the lens parallax was measured . therefore , these events should be at the top of the target list . in the published literature , we find 10 events , for which the source star was well resolved ( alcock et al . 1997 , 2000a ; albrow et al .   1999 , 2000 , 2001a , b ; afonso et al .  2000 ; an et al .  2002 ) , and 11 events , for which parallax effect was measured ( alcock et al .  1995b ; mao 1999 ; soszyski et al .  2001 ; smith , mao , & woniak 2002 ) . another possible high priority targets will be the longest events with @xmath71 days . these events can not be well explained by the standard models of the geometrical and kinematical distributions of lenses and their mass function ( han & gould 1996 ) . although these events comprise a small fraction ( @xmath72 ) of the total number of events , they are important because their contribution to the total optical depth is important . detection of lenses and the measured proper motions ( or non - detection of lenses ) will allow one to better constrain the nature of these mysterious events . we have estimated the fraction of galactic bulge microlensing events for which the lenses can be directly imaged from future high resolution followup observations by computing the distribution of proper motions of the currently detected bulge events and imposing realistic criteria for lens resolution . from this computation , we find that lens identification will be possible for a significant fraction of bulge events from followup observations using ngst under the assumption that most bulge events are caused by normal stars . besides identifying lenses as stars , direct lens imaging will allow one to accurately determine the lens proper motion , from which the physical parameters of the individual lenses can be better constrained . if lenses are imaged for events where lens parallaxes were measured , the lens parameter degeneracy can be completely broken and the lens mass can be uniquely determined . in addition , high resolution followup observations will provide a valuable chance to measure the angular radii of remote bulge source stars involved with events for which the source was previously resolved via either a source transit or a caustic crossing . afonso , c. et al . , 2000 , , 532 , 340 alard c. , guibert j. , 1997 , , 326 , 1 albrow m.  d.  et al . , 1999 , , 522 , 1011 albrow m.  d.  et al . , 2000 , , 534 , 894 albrow m.  d.  et al . , 2001a , , 549 , 759 albrow m.  d.  et al . , 2001b , , 550 , l173 alcock c.  et al . , 1993 , nature , 365 , 621 alcock c.  et al . , 1995a , , 445 , 133 alcock c.  et al . , 1995b , , 454 , l125 alcock c.  et al . , 1997 , , 491 , 436 alcock c.  et al . , 2000a , , 541 , 270 alcock c.  et al . , 2000b , , 541 , 734 alcock c.  et al . , 2001 , nature , 414 , 617 alonso a. , salaris m. , arribas s. , martinez -

"the apparent metallic - like temperature dependence of the resistivity is observed in various two - dimensional ( 2d ) carrier systems @xcite and remains a focus of a broad interest because it challenges the conventional theory of the metallic conduction . the effect manifests itself in a strong drop of the resistivity over a limited range of temperatures , @xmath0 , from a high temperature value ( call it ` drude ' value ) @xmath1 to a low temperature one @xmath2 , here @xmath3 is the fermi temperature . upon lowering the temperature further , a strong ` metallic ' drop in @xmath4 was found to cross over to the conventional weak localization type dependence @xcite . recently , it was demonstrated @xcite that the ` metallic ' drop is not related to quantum interference and in this sense should have a semiclassical origin . magnetic field applied in the plane of the 2d system causes a dramatic increase in resistivity @xcite . it was proven experimentally @xcite that the magnetoresistance ( mr ) in si - mos samples is mainly caused by spin - effects , though certain contribution of orbital effects @xcite is noticeable at very large fields @xcite , bigger than the field of the spin polarization . the two effects , _ strong metallic drop in resistivity _  and _ parallel field magnetoresistance _ remain _ puzzling_.    in this paper we demonstrate that ( i ) the strength of both effects is well matched and ( ii ) the action of magnetic field on conduction is similar to that of disorder and to some extent to that of temperature . in particular , in the presence of in - plane magnetic field the strong temperature dependence of the resistivity for a high mobility sample transforms into a weaker one and shifts to higher temperatures ; both these features are typical for low mobility samples . next , ( iii ) the effect of the magnetic field on the resistivity is continuous and shows no signatures of a threshold . finally , ( iv ) increase in either temperature or parallel magnetic field restores the same high - temperature ( ` drude ' ) resistivity value while transport remains non - activated . matching of the actions of the above controlling parameters sets substantial constraints on the choice of theoretical models . we performed measurements on a number of different mobility ( 100 ) @xmath5si - mos samples , because this system demonstrates the most dramatic appearance of the discussed effects . table  [ samples ] below shows the relevant parameters for the four most intensively studied samples whose mobilities differ by a factor of  25 ; parameters for other samples were reported in refs . @xcite . .relevant parameters of the five samples . @xmath6 [ m@xmath7/vs ] is the peak mobility at @xmath8k , @xmath9 is in units of @xmath10 , and   @xmath11 is in @xmath12@xmath13 . [ cols=""^,^,^,^"",options=""header "" , ]     for the curve _ 3 _ , the fit is not perfect because it oscillates vs temperature , which is beyond the frameworks of the model . the only steep feature may be found in the field dependence of @xmath14 at the transition from insulating to metallic behavior ; this however may be caused by a minor mismatching of the oversimplified model curves in the metallic and insulating ranges . the ` activation energy ' @xmath15 depends on the choice of the model and on average is 2 - 3 times larger than the values estimated from fig . the right columns in table 2 ) . this discrepancy is presumably caused by the admixture to the data of a non - exponential temperature dependence which is essentially strong for the considered sample and which can not be separated at low temperatures from the exponential one . for example , we were able to achieve a reasonable fit of the data with eq . ( 2 ) , using the _ calculated _ in table  2 values @xmath16 when we modeled the ` tilted separatrix ' in eq . ( [ tilted ] ) by a power low factor , @xmath17 , rather than by the polynomial factor .    in ref . @xcite it was stated that `` the effect of magnetic field can not be ascribed solely to a field - induced change in the critical electron density '' . we verified this possibility and arrive at the opposite conclusion . the success of our fitting confirms that the action of the parallel field , at least , to the first approximation consists in progressive increase of disorder . this is described by increasing the @xmath18-independent scattering rate @xmath19 , decreasing the magnitude of the resistivity drop , @xmath20 , and increasing the critical carrier density @xmath21 ; the three parameters are not independent and within the same material system may be reduced only to the single parameter , e.g. @xmath21 . to summarize , the results reported in this paper demonstrate that the effect of the parallel magnetic field on resistivity in high mobility si - mos samples ( though via zeeman coupling ) is similar to that of disorder and , to some extent , to that of temperature . in other words , _ parallel magnetic field increases disorder_. the temperature dependence of resistivity for various disorder and magnetic fields may be reduced to the dependences of the ` critical ' density @xmath11 on magnetic field and on disorder ; the changes in the resistivity drop with temperature , @xmath22 , caused by disorder and magnetic field may be also mapped onto each other . we find a similarity between the action of the parallel field and temperature for the region of carrier density and field where conduction remains ` non - activated ' . these findings set constraints on the choice of the developed microscopic models .    the analogy between the parallel field and disorder points to the existence of a sub - band of localized carriers . such band of localized carriers should lift in energy as a function of the parallel field , gets ` undressed ' after passing through the fermi energy and cause the increase in the scattering rate . the strong evidence for this mechanism is the variation in the hall voltage observed in the vicinity of the metal - insulator transition . we can not exclude also the contribution of the inter spin - subband scattering , as a complementary feature to the above mechanism . however , our shubnikov - de haas data @xcite indicates that the mobility in different spin and valley sub - bands of conducting electrons are almost equal and the intersubband scattering does not play a major role in the themperature- and parallel field- dependence of the resistance . applying the model of a field dependent disorder , we find a qualitative explanation of the whole set of presented results . one of the authors ( v.p . ) acknowledges hospitality of the lorenz centre for theoretical physics at leiden , where part of this work was done and reported at the workshop in june , 2000 . the work was supported by nsf dmr-0077825 , austrian science fund ( fwf p13439 ) , intas ( 99 - 1070 ) , rfbr ( 00 - 02 - 17706 ) , the programs physics of solid state nanostructures , statistical physics , integration and ` the state support of the leading scientific schools ' . s.  v.  kravchenko , g.  v.  kravchenko , j.  e.  furneaux , v.  m.  pudalov , and m.  diorio , phys . b * 50 * , 8039 ( 1994 ) ; s.  v.  kravchenko , g.  e.  bowler , j.  e.  furneaux , v.  m.  pudalov , and m.  diorio , phys . rev . b * 51 * , 7038 ( 1995 ) . d.  popovi , a.  b.  fowler , s.  washburn , phys . lett . * 79 * , 1543 ( 1997 ) . t.  coleridge , r.  l.  williams , y.feng , p.  zawadszki , phys . b. * 56 * , r12764 ( 1997 ) . a.  r.  hamilton , m.  y.  simmons , m.  pepper , e.  h.  linfield , p.  h.  rose , and d.  a.  ritchie , phys . * 82 * , 1542 ( 1999 ) . the magnetic field driven transition from non - activated to activated conduction regime causes a strong exponential magnetoresistance @xmath23 , where @xmath24 ; therefore , @xmath25 scales as @xmath26 . a theoretical consideration see in ref .","The text discusses the effect of a magnetic field on the resistivity of two-dimensional (2D) carrier systems, specifically in the context of silicon-on-insulator (Si MOS) materials.

 while conduction remains non - activated , the parallel magnetic field restores the same resistivity value as the high temperature does . 
 this matching sets substantial constraints on the choice of the theoretical models developed to explain the mechanism of the metallic conduction and parallel field magnetoresistance in 2d carrier systems . 
 we demonstrate that the data for magneto- and temperature dependence of the resistivity of si - mos samples in parallel field may be well described by a simple mechanism of the magnetic field dependent disorder .    2",7890,493,1046,9.84 seconds,-0.16 MB,0.35593220338983045,0.09401709401709403,0.1864406779661017,0.8300713300704956,medium
"markarian  421 ( mrk  421 , j1104 + 3812 ) is a nearby bl lacertae object ( @xmath7 ) and was the first extragalactic tev gamma - ray source discovered @xcite . the tev gamma - ray flux is variable , with flaring behavior observed on time - scales of less than an hour @xcite . extensive measurements have been performed by several experimental groups based on the imaging cherenkov technique  @xcite . multi - wavelength observations support the synchrotron  self compton ( ssc ) mechanism for the production of tev gamma - rays from this source  ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? tev gamma - rays from extra - galactic sources suffer absorption due to photon - photon interactions with the inter - galactic infrared background radiation  @xcite . according to recent measurements of the infrared background  ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) and predictions of the optical depth for tev gamma - rays  @xcite , gamma - rays at energies above 10  tev from mrk  421 are expected to be suppressed , since they interact with mid- to far - infrared photons of @xmath0100  @xmath8 m . mrk  421 became active in 2000 and 2001 , especially at the beginning of 2001  @xcite . during this period , northern hemisphere observers measured the energy spectrum with good statistics in the region from several hundred gev to @xmath010  tev and reported cutoffs at 36  tev @xcite . the cutoff energy is consistent with , or slightly smaller than , that measured for mrk  501 during its flaring state in 1997  @xcite . as mrk  501 has a similar redshift ( @xmath9 ) to mrk  421 , this suggests the cutoffs may be due to infrared absorption of tev gamma - rays . we observed mrk  421 during the 2001 high state with the cangaroo - ii 10  meter telescope , at very large zenith angles of @xmath070@xmath1 . similar observations have been reported by the durham group for mrk  501 in the high state of 1997  @xcite . for these observations , an effective collecting area @xmath010 times larger than that for observations near the zenith is obtained , with an accompanying increase in the gamma - ray energy threshold to @xmath010  tev . the observations were made with the cangaroo - ii 10  meter telescope  @xcite , located near woomera , south australia , australia ( 136@xmath147@xmath10e , 31@xmath106@xmath10s ) . the telescope consists of 114 segmented optical mirrors , each of 80  cm diameter  @xcite . the camera contains 552 half - inch photomultiplier tubes , arranged at 0@xmath1.115 intervals , and covering a field of view of @xmath03@xmath1 . mrk  421 was observed for ten nights in early 2001 ; january 24 , 26 , 27 , 30 , 31 and february 1 , and march 14 ( all dates in ut ) , when the source was extremely active . from the cangaroo - ii telescope site , mrk  421 culminates at a zenith angle of 69@xmath1.3 . approximately two hours observations were made per night . off source data were taken with the right ascension suitably offset . an event trigger was registered when 3 individual pixels exceeded a threshold of @xmath02.5 photoelectrons . after rejecting data affected by clouds and those at zenith angles greater than 71@xmath1.5 , 14.34  hours on source data and 16.65  hours off source data remain . a software trigger was applied in order to reduce the effect of pixels randomly triggered by the night sky background . pixels with pulse - heights of greater than @xmath03.3 photoelectrons , pixel trigger times within 40  nanoseconds of the central value for the event , and three or more adjacent pixels were required . finally , four or more pixels surviving these cuts were required in each event . large zenith angle observations are well - suited to searching for gamma - ray signals at higher energies , as a much larger effective area can be achieved compared to observations near the zenith  @xcite , though with a higher energy threshold . from monte carlo simulations  @xcite , an effective area of @xmath11 at @xmath12  tev was estimated for observations at 70@xmath1 , with the area increasing to @xmath13 for higher energies . a threshold energy ( where the gamma - ray detection rate is maximized ) of @xmath011  tev was derived for a @xmath14 spectrum . this is an increase by a factor of @xmath030 in comparison with observations near zenith . the energy threshold changes by @xmath151  tev if the spectral index is varied by @xmath20.5 . the selection of the gamma - ray events is based on the parameterization of the elongated shape of the cherenkov light image using the standard parameters : @xmath16 , @xmath17 ( shape ) , @xmath18 ( location ) , @xmath19 ( direction ) , and @xmath20 ( orientation angle )  @xcite . instead of the conventional parameterization cuts , we adopted the likelihood method  @xcite , which has a higher efficiency of gamma - ray discrimination than the conventional parameterization technique . the likelihood method uses a single parameter , @xmath21 $ ] , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the probabilities for the event having been initiated by a gamma - ray from the source or a background event , respectively . they are the products of individual probabilities for @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath19 , which are derived from the probability density functions , including the energy dependence . these functions were obtained using gamma - ray simulations for the signal and the observed off source events for the background . @xmath24 ranges from 0  to  1 , and the probability of a gamma - ray origin for an event increases as @xmath24 becomes closer to 1 , though the gamma - ray acceptance does not significantly decrease in the range of @xmath25  0.5 . we adopted a relatively loose cut of @xmath26  0.4 with an additional requirement of @xmath27 . with these cuts and a further cut excluding events with @xmath28 , 86  % of background events are rejected while 63  % of gamma - ray events are expected to be retained .    the resulting event distribution of @xmath20 is shown in figure  [ fig : alpha ]  ( a ) ( left panel ) . a clear excess over the background is apparent around the source direction . the excess is broadly distributed , up to @xmath0  30@xmath1 , due to the deterioration of the pointing resolution , caused by the shrinkage of the gamma - ray shower image . this spread in @xmath20 distribution is consistent with simulations , as shown in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : alpha ] . the off source distribution was normalized to that of the on source by the ratio of the number of the events in @xmath29 ( 0.88 ) , which is consistent with the ratio of observation times ( 0.86 ) , within statistical errors . an excess of 298@xmath252  events , with a significance of 5.7  @xmath3 ( calculated using the method of @xcite ) was obtained in the region of @xmath30 . for the confirmation of the detected signal , the conventional parameterization cuts of 0@xmath1.2@xmath311@xmath1.1 , 0@xmath1.06@xmath320@xmath1.18 , and 0@xmath1.03@xmath330@xmath1.14 were applied to the data , and a signal of 286@xmath255  events was obtained with 5.2  @xmath3 significance . since the observations were undertaken at large zenith angles , @xmath0  70@xmath1 , we carefully examined the data and the simulations in more detail :    \1 . the shrinkage of the shower image , which is problematic for large angle observations , was studied by a comparison between simulations and data using the background events due to cosmic - ray hadrons . figure  [ fig : para ] shows the imaging parameters @xmath17 and @xmath16 , observed at large ( @xmath070@xmath1 ) and small ( @xmath015@xmath1 ) zenith angles , respectively . the hadron simulations were made using the corsika code ( version 6.004 )  @xcite , considering the cosmic - ray abundance in the tev region  @xcite . the resultant distributions of the simulations agree with the data for both small and large angles . it is also noted that our high resolution imaging camera , which has a pixel spacing size of 0.115@xmath1 , helped to separate the smaller images of gamma - ray events from those of background events . the expected @xmath17 and @xmath16 distributions of the gamma - ray events , simulated with the spacing size of 0@xmath1.115 and 0@xmath1.230 , are shown in the bottom panels of figure  [ fig : para ] . with the larger pixel size , the reconstructed image size increases and becomes more similar to those of hadrons , with an estimated @xmath050  % decrease in the separation efficiency . although gamma - ray detection is still possible with the larger spacing , the higher resolution imaging camera is more advantageous for large zenith angle observations . the @xmath18 distribution of the gamma - ray selected events was compared to those from simulations . the location of cherenkov images due to gamma - ray cascades in the field of view has a particular distribution , while those due to hadron showers are uniformly distributed . for large zenith angle observations in particular , as the observed distances of gamma - ray shower images decrease , there is a substantial difference with the background distribution . figure  [ fig : distance ] shows the @xmath18 distribution of the gamma - ray selected events , which is obtained by subtracting the off source distribution from the on source distribution after the likelihood and @xmath20 cuts were applied . the resulting distribution has a clear peak around 0@xmath1.7 from the source direction , which agrees reasonably well with simulations and differs from that of the cosmic ray background , which provides additional confirmation of the detection of tev gamma - rays . the `` standard candle '' at tev energies , the crab nebula , was observed at relatively large zenith angles of @xmath055@xmath1 in november and december 2000 , and the gamma - ray flux was measured for the confirmation of the analysis method and the estimation of the systematic error in the energy scale . using the same analysis technique as that used for mrk  421 , the differential energy spectrum was derived over the energy range from 2  tev to @xmath020  tev  @xcite , which agrees well with other experiments  @xcite , within a @xmath015  % error in the energy scale . these consistencies provide robust supporting evidence for the detection of @xmath4  tev gamma - rays from mrk  421 . figure  [ fig : energyflux ] ( inserted panel ) shows the raw energy spectrum of the observed gamma - ray events from mrk  421 . the gamma - ray energy was assigned from the pulse - height sum of the individual pixels , using a relation obtained from the simulations . this method is similar to that described in @xcite , and an energy resolution of @xmath031  % is estimated . the excess events are distributed in the energy range 745  tev , however one must take care of the spill - over effect from the lower energies due to the finite energy resolution . in order to take this effect into account , simulated gamma - ray spectra , with the spectral indexes and cutoff energies varied , were compared to the data and the observed spectral parameters were determined from the values which minimized the value of @xmath34 . with the assumption of a power - law spectrum , the differential flux was fitted by      with @xmath34=2.5/2  @xmath36 the cut dependence on @xmath24 and @xmath20 parameters , and the trigger conditions in the simulation , were considered as sources of the systematic uncertainties . the systematic errors giving rise to uncertainty in the energy scale such as cherenkov photon scattering in the atmosphere are not included here , but are considered in more detail later . the derived spectrum is steeper than those observed at lower tev energies . the spectral shape was tested with a cutoff spectrum of @xmath37 , as was derived from the measurements by the whipple and hegra - ct groups , with the spectral index being the hardest one observed during the strong flaring period  @xcite . the fitting result did not improve compared to that with the power - law assumption ( @xmath34=5.0/3  @xmath36 ) , as an excess of events above 20  tev is apparent , as shown in fig  [ fig : alpha ]  ( b ) . an excess of 103@xmath226 ( 4.0  @xmath3 ) was observed with @xmath38 , while 11  events are expected for the cutoff spectrum , based on an estimation using the event ratio between 1020  tev and over 20  tev . however , if a cutoff energy of 8  tev is assumed , the consistency with the data becomes better ( 48 events expected for @xmath39 ) . this cutoff energy is at the high end of the range allowed for mrk  501  ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) . since these two agns have similar redshifts , the cutoff energies in both spectra are expected to be similar , assuming the attenuation is predominantly due to infrared absorption . as there is only a 2@xmath3 difference between our observations and this prediction , our result falls in the acceptable range of the absorption hypothesis due to the cosmic infrared background . figure  [ fig : energyflux ] ( main panel ) shows the measured energy flux , assuming the power - law spectrum . data for the whipple  @xcite and hegra - ct groups  @xcite , observed during a similar period of the flaring state ( january  march 2001 ) are also shown . the observation periods were not exactly the same and the source varied significantly during this high state , therefore the absolute fluxes are expected to differ at some level . the absolute flux level determined from the cangaroo - ii data is within the observed range of the flux variation reported by the whipple group  @xcite , and the spectral slope around 10  tev is consistent with that of these two groups , supporting the roll - over from the flatter spectrum measured at lower energies .    for large zenith angle observations , a large uncertainty in the energy scale , due to the absorption of cherenkov photons in the atmosphere , is inevitable . only rayleigh scattering was considered in the simulation code to avoid over - estimating the gamma - ray energies . the inclusion of mie scattering and ozone absorption would affect the energy scale by @xmath030  % and @xmath03  % , respectively , based on numerical estimations using the program code of @xcite . we stress that these effects increase the energy scale . the use of the `` flat - earth '' approximation for the atmosphere in the simulations requires a @xmath06  % correction which has already been taken into account in the discussion above . the measurement of spectra at large zenith angles was verified by observations of the crab nebula up to the zenith angles of @xmath055@xmath1 , although calibration using the crab nebula at the same zenith angles as the mrk  421 observations ( @xmath070@xmath1 ) is unfortunately impractical with the current instrumental sensitivity . the strong gamma - ray emission of mrk  421 ( @xmath0  3 times that of crab nebula ) enabled us to detect the source in only 14  hours . in order to detect the crab nebula at the same significance level , more than 150  hours observations would be required .    in summary , owing to the large effective area and the high resolution performance of the cherenkov imaging camera , e@xmath4010  tev gamma - rays from mrk  421 were detected at a high confidence level at zenith angles of @xmath070@xmath1 with 14  hours of observations . the derived spectrum in the region of 1030  tev is steeper than that around 1  tev , which supports the cutoff spectrum of mrk  421 measured in the 0.210  tev range by other groups . the excess observed above 20  tev is strongly suggestive of a higher cutoff energy , @xmath08  tev , compared to the lower energy observations . these observations confirm , with the support of detailed simulations , the viability of the large zenith angle technique . large zenith angle observations provide a unique method of measuring the spectrum in the important energy range above 10  tev with a relatively short observation time . the authors thank f.  krennrich and d.  horns for kindly providing flux data . this project is supported by a grant -

The article discusses the discovery of a nearby bl lacertae object, Markarian 421 (MRK 421), a nearby extragalactic TeV gamma-ray source.

"gravity and dark energy govern the structure in the universe at the largest scales but complex baryonic processes like cooling , heating , self - gravity and star formation are important at galactic scales ( e.g. , @xcite ) . numerical simulations have made tremendous progress in understanding galaxy formation , starting from pure gravitational n - body simulations to the current models which try to model the aforementioned complex processes . modeling the gravitationally - interacting dark matter is straightforward in principle , and only limited by the available computing power . but the modeling of baryonic processes is rather involved . in particular , there is no consensus on which baryonic processes are important and how they should be implemented numerically . given the dynamic range of scales , from large scale structure ( 10s of mpc ) to an individual star forming cloud ( @xmath4pc ) , simulations have to resort to unresolved ` subgrid ' models for star formation and feedback due to star formation ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) . while different star formation recipes seem to give similar star formation histories and stellar mass distributions , provided molecular clouds are resolved ( e.g. , @xcite ) , simulations are quite sensitive to the various feedback prescriptions ( e.g. , thermal feedback due to supernovae , momentum injection via dust absorbing / scattering photons produced by massive stars and supernovae ) even with high resolution . stars form in clusters and super - star - clusters ( 100s to @xmath5 stars ) of various sizes and in different environments , ranging from low density galactic outskirts to dense galactic centers ( see @xcite for a review ) . these clusters are observed to disrupt the dense molecular clouds in which they are born ( e.g. , see @xcite ) . this stellar feedback ( due to strong radiation , stellar winds and supernovae ) disperses cold gas and suppresses further star formation . because of the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) and the main sequence lifetimes , the energy input is roughly constant per unit time over the life time of stars more massive than @xmath6 ( @xmath7 myr ; @xcite ) . therefore , stellar feedback is sometimes modeled as a constant luminosity driven blast wave ( @xcite ) . a superbubble ( sb ) expands faster than an isolated supernova remnant ( snr ) because of continuous energy injection , and suffers smaller cooling losses because most supernovae ( sne ) go off in a low density bubble .    the hot bubble breaks out through the gas disk if the outer shock driven by overlapping sne crosses the scale height with a sufficient mach number within the starburst lifetime ( e.g. , see section 2 of @xcite ) . after breakout the hot , metal - rich stellar ejecta is spread out into the galactic halo via the rayleigh - taylor instability . spreading of metals over large scales is required to explain the high metallicity observed in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) , far away from the stellar disk ( @xcite ) . standard models for feedback through multiple sne assume that a fraction @xmath8 of the total explosion energy is retained in the hot ism ( e.g. , @xcite ) . this fraction is much larger than the estimates for a single snr ( @xmath9 ) after the radiative phase at @xmath0 myr ( e.g. , @xcite ) . moreover , there are further radiative and adiabatic losses , such that over the timescale of order tens of myr , the available mechanical energy in the bubble and shell is a negligible ( @xmath10 ) fraction of the initial supernova ( sn ) energy input . recently @xcite argued that sbs created by multiple sne in a star cluster are more effective as a feedback mechanism , in comparison to incoherent sne . recent simulations of interacting sne by @xcite show that the fractional energy retained as thermal energy in the hot ism can be as large as @xmath11 only if the explosions are spatially and temporally correlated such that the radiative losses are effectively compensated by new explosions . sbs produced by compact star clusters are expected to satisfy this condition . in this paper we assume all sne to be coincident , a good approximation if the snr , when it becomes radiative , encompasses the whole cluster . this makes sbs a more effective feedback agent which is responsible for magnificent galactic outflows . in addition to elucidating differences between isolated sne and sbs , we compare various methods of injecting sn energy in numerical simulations of the ism . different feedback processes , such as radiation pressure , photoionization , and cosmic rays , are important in explaining outflows in galaxies of different masses and redshifts ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) . in this paper we only focus on the most important feedback component , namely , thermal feedback due to sne . we find that the sn thermal energy must be deposited over a sufficiently small volume for it to create a hot bubble and to have an impact on the surroundings . for a large energy deposition radius the cooling time is shorter than the thermalization timescale and thermal feedback is artificially suppressed . most early implementations of sn feedback suffered from this problem ( see @xcite and references therein ) .    the formation of a low density bubble is essential for thermal sn feedback to work because the energy of subsequent sne is deposited in the low density bubble and is not radiated instantaneously ; cooling is only restricted to the outer shock . while this fact has been appreciated ( e.g. , @xcite ) , we present _ quantitative _ conditions for the formation of a strong shock and a hot , dilute bubble for different thermal feedback prescriptions . the main culprit responsible for the inefficacy of thermal feedback , in both eulerian ( e.g. , @xcite ) and lagrangian ( @xcite ) simulations , is the lack of resolution . in reality , a sn affects its surroundings starting at small ( @xmath12 1 pc ) scales by launching very fast ejecta ( @xmath13 km s@xmath14 ) into the ism ( e.g. , see @xcite ) . simulations in which sn energy is not deposited at small enough scales have to resort to artificial measures ( turning off cooling for several energy injection timescales , depositing energy into artificial ` hot ' phase that does not cool , etc . ) in order for feedback to have any impact at all on the ism ( e.g. , @xcite ) . these measures are necessary for including the effects of supernova heating in large - scale simulations . the continuous injection of mass and energy by sne deep within the hot sb is expected to launch a steady wind ( as first calculated by @xcite ; hereafter cc85 ) . cc85 obtained analytic solutions for a superwind assuming a constant thermal energy and mass input rate with an injection radius . by modeling realistic sne as fast moving ejecta within sbs we show that a steady cc85 wind is obtained only if a large number of sne ( @xmath3 ) go off within the star cluster . for a smaller number of sne , an individual sn s kinetic energy is not thermalized within a small injection radius and there is an unsteady outflow . this should have implications for works that simply assume a cc85 wind within the sb . our paper presents analytic results that can be readily used for the numerical implementation of thermal feedback using various recipes . these analytic criteria are verified and extended using idealized numerical simulations . the fundamental difference between isolated supernovae and superbubbles  that the former is ineffective on galactic scales is highlighted . the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : fb_pres ] we describe various ways of implementing thermal feedback due to sne . section [ sec : num_sim ] describes the numerical setup used to study sne and sbs . in section [ sec : anal ] we present different analytic criteria for feedback to work with a range of feedback prescriptions . we also derive the conditions for obtaining a thermalized cc85 wind within a sb . in section [ sec : results ] we present 1-d numerical simulations of different feedback recipes with and without cooling , and compare the results with our analytic estimates . we also briefly discuss the effects of magnetic fields and thermal conduction . in section [ sec : conc ] we discuss the implications of our results on galaxy formation , feedback simulations , and on galactic wind observations . although ism is multiphase and extremely complex , for simplicity we consider a uniform , static model with a given density ( typically @xmath15 @xmath16 ) and temperature ( @xmath17 k corresponding to the warm ism ) . we do not consider stratification because the disk scale height is typically a few 100 pc and the fizzling of sn feedback is essentially a small scale problem . moreover , the scales of interest ( 100s of pc ; few myr ) are much bigger than the cluster size and the local ism / circumstellar inhomogeneities . for simplicity we also assume that all sne explode at @xmath18 . this is a good approximation because the size of a typical ( super ) star - cluster is smaller than the bubble size at the beginning of the radiative phase .    the sn prescriptions that we consider in our analytic estimates and numerical simulations cover the full range of methods used in the literature . these are :    1 .   _ kinetic explosion models _ ( ke ) : in these models the sn energy ( @xmath19 , chosen to be 1 bethe @xmath20 erg ) is given to a specified ejecta mass ( @xmath21 , chosen to be 1 @xmath22 ) distributed uniformly with an ejecta density @xmath23 within an ejecta radius @xmath24 . the ejecta velocity is homologous with @xmath25 within the ejecta ; the normalization is such that the kinetic energy of the ejecta is @xmath19 ; i.e. , @xmath26 . the ejecta temperature is taken to be small ( @xmath27 k ) . after every ( fixed ) sn injection time @xmath28 the innermost @xmath24 of the volume is _ overwritten _ by the ejecta density and velocity , thereby pumping sn energy into the ism . after the reverse shock propagates toward the bubble center , once the swept - up mass is comparable to the ejecta mass , the bubble density structure is fairly insensitive to the ejecta density distribution ( @xcite ) . this model most closely resembles a physical snr in early stages at small ( @xmath12 1 pc ) scales when the sn ` piston ' at large speed rams into the ism . this prescription is not widely used in galaxy formation simulations ( there are some exceptions , e.g. , @xcite ) . 2 .   _ thermal explosion models _ ( te ) : in these models the energy is deposited within the ejecta radius in form of thermal energy at an interval of @xmath28 . there are two variants of this model . in one class , the mass and internal energy densities are _ overwritten _ within the ejecta radius ( @xmath24 ) such that the _ uniformly distributed _ ejecta thermal energy is @xmath19 ( 1 bethe ) and the _ uniformly distributed _ ejecta mass is @xmath29 . we abbreviate these models as teo and they behave like ke models . the second class of models is where we _ add _ ( in contrast to overwrite ) the ejecta mass ( with uniform density ) to the preexisting mass and the ejecta thermal energy ( distributed uniformly ) to the preexisting internal energy within @xmath24 . we refer to these models as tea . there are significant differences between the tea and teo / ke models in presence of cooling because tea ejecta can become radiative if thermal energy is added to a dense ism . most models in the literature are analogous to tea models with some variations ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ; some works such as @xcite , @xcite , @xcite unphysically turn off cooling for some time for sn feedback to have an impact ) . sometimes all the sn energy is deposited in a single grid cell ( e.g. , @xcite ) or in a single particle ( e.g. , sn particle method in section 3.2.4 of @xcite ) . luminosity driven models _ ( ld ) : as discussed earlier , for typical imfs , the mechanical energy input due to ob stars per unit time is roughly constant . this motivates a model in which internal energy and mass within an injection radius ( denoted by @xmath24 ) increase at a constant rate corresponding to internal energy @xmath19 and mass @xmath21 for each sn . some of the works that use this prescription are @xcite . all our models are identified with the number of ob stars @xmath30 ( which equals the number of sne in the star cluster ) or luminosity @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the lifetime of the ob association ( taken to be 30 myr ) and @xmath33 is the time interval between sne . we note that the overwrite models do not strictly conserve mass and energy . while the supernova energy is much larger than the overwritten thermal energy , one needs to choose a small enough ejecta radius such that the overwritten mass is subdominant relative to the ejecta mass . the explosion models are substantially slower compared to the smooth luminosity driven models because of very high temperatures created due to sudden energy injection in the former . in this section we describe the numerical setup corresponding to our one - dimensional simulations discussed in section [ sec : results ] . our numerical simulations use the ism setup and the various feedback prescriptions described in section [ sec : fb_pres ] . the ism density and temperature are chosen to 1 @xmath16 and @xmath17 k , respectively , unless specified otherwise . the mean mass per particle is @xmath34 and per electron is @xmath35 . the initial density and temperature are uniform , and the velocity is zero . we use the grid - based zeus - mp code in spherical , one - dimensional geometry ( @xcite ) to solve the standard euler equations with source terms mimicking sn energy / momentum / mass injection for the chosen feedback model , and a sink term in the internal energy equation representing radiative cooling . our equations are similar but not identical to eqs . 20 - 22 in @xcite . we note that the zeus code does not conserve energy to the machine precision . however , we have confirmed that energy conservation holds to better than 90% in most of our runs . in fact , the sedov - taylor blast wave in 1-d spherical coordinates is one of the standard test problems presented in @xcite ; the numerical results match analytic solutions very closely . while most of our runs are hydro , in section [ sec : b_cond ] we briefly discuss runs with simple models of magnetic fields and thermal conduction ; various parameters for these runs are discussed there . the radial velocity is set to zero at the inner radial boundary and other fluid variables are copied in the ghost cells . outflow boundary conditions are applied at the outer radial boundary . note that the outer boundary is out of causal contact . since the setup produces strong shocks , we use the standard zeus artificial viscosity to prevent unphysical oscillations at shocks ( @xcite ) . the cfl number of 0.2 is found to be more robust compared to the standard value of 0.5 , and is used in all the simulations . the cooling function that we use is the collisional - ionization - equilibrium based solar metallicity table of @xcite , with the cooling function set to zero below @xmath17 k. the cooling step is implemented via operator splitting using the semi - implicit method of @xcite . cooling is subcycled and the number of subcycles is limited to be less than 100 . most of our runs use a 1024 resolution grid extending from 1 pc to 2 kpc . a logarithmically spaced grid is used to better resolve smaller radii ; there are equal number of grid points covering 1 pc to @xmath36 pc and @xmath36 pc to 2 kpc . some runs with stronger sn feedback use a larger spatial extent ( c.f . @xmath37 runs in fig . [ fig : rho_vs_r_cc85 ] ) , and some uniform very high resolution runs ( 16384 grid points ; c.f . fig . [ fig : d_t ] ) use a smaller extent ( 1 to 200 pc ) . all our simulations ( except the very high resolution ones that are run for 3 myr ) are run for 30 myr , typical age of a young star cluster . in this section we present the analytic criteria that need to be satisfied for various feedback models discussed in section [ sec : fb_pres ] to work . these analytic estimates help us understand the results of numerical simulations discussed in section [ sec : results ] . while radiative cooling is the most discussed phenomenon in the context of fizzling sn feedback , the feedback prescription should satisfy additional constraints for the energy input to couple realistically with the ism . a recurring concept in what follows is that of thermalization ; i.e. , in order to be effective the input energy should have time to couple to the ism before it is radiated or is overwritten . in section [ sec : cc85 ] we show that a steady superwind within a superbubble , as envisaged by @xcite , occurs only if the number of sne is sufficiently large .    in the following sections we derive upper limits on the ejecta radius within which the feedback energy must be deposited for it to be effective . we can easily convert this radius limit into a critical mass resolution needed in smooth - particle - hydrodynamics ( sph ) simulations ; namely , @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the ism density , @xmath40 is the number of neighbors used in the sph smoothing kernel and @xmath41 is the maximum sph gas particle mass required for feedback to work .        in models where energy within the ejecta radius is overwritten ( ke , teo ) the ejecta radius should be smaller than a critical radius ( @xmath42 ) for the input energy to get coupled to the ism . the critical radius equals the sedov - taylor shock radius at @xmath28 , because the shock quickly transitions from a free - expanding to a sedov - taylor state ; the sedov - taylor radius ( when the swept up ism mass equals the ejecta mass ) is @xmath43 , much smaller than the estimate in eq . [ eq : r_therm ] , where @xmath44 is the ejecta mass in solar units . ] the time lag between sne , [ eq : r_therm ] r_crit ( ) ^1/5 50  pc  n^-1/5 e_ej,51 ^ 1/5 t_sn,0.3 ^ 2/5 , where @xmath39 ( @xmath45 ) is the ism ( number ) density ( assuming @xmath34 ) , @xmath46 is the ejecta energy in units of @xmath47 erg , and @xmath48 is the time between consecutive sne in units of @xmath49 myr . if the ejecta radius is larger than this value the ejecta energy is overwritten before it can push the outer shock . thus , in such a case , the input sn energy is overwritten without much affecting the ism .      for thermal sn feedback to launch a strong shock the energy should be deposited over a small enough volume , such that the post - shock pressure is much larger than the ism pressure . this is equivalent to demanding the outer shock velocity to be much larger than the sound speed in the ism . the shock velocity ( @xmath50 ; @xmath51 is the outer shock radius ) , expressed in terms of the shock radius in sedov - taylor stage , is @xmath52 for an isolated sn and @xmath53 for a luminosity driven sb ( @xcite ) . the condition for a strong shock for an isolated sn is ( @xmath54 ; @xmath55 is the ism isothermal sound speed ) [ eq : r_sn ] r_ej 174  pc  e_ej,51 ^ 1/3 n^-1/3 t_4 ^ -1/3 and for a sb is ( see eq . 3 in @xcite ) [ eq : r_sb ] r_ej 1.5   kpc  l_ej,38 ^ 1/2 n^-1/2 t_4 ^ -3/4 , where @xmath56 is the ejecta luminosity ( @xmath57 for explosion models ) in units of @xmath58 erg s@xmath14 ( this corresponds to @xmath59 over @xmath60 myr ) and @xmath61 is the ism temperature in units of @xmath17 k.    the sonic constraint ( @xmath54 ) is typically less restrictive than the compactness requirements due to cooling in a dense ism ( see next section ) . @xcite , who considered supernova feedback in the hot ism ( @xmath62 k ) of galaxy clusters and elliptical galaxies , found that the shock can quickly ( when outer radius is only @xmath63 pc ; see eq . [ eq : r_sn ] ) decelerate to attain the sound speed in the hot ism . after this the outer shock propagates as a sound wave . while the sound wave can spread the sn energy over a larger radius ( @xmath64 for a sound wave , unlike a strong blast wave in which @xmath65 ) , energy dissipation is not as efficient as in shocks .        in luminosity driven models ( ld ) , sn feedback does not fizzle out ( in fact , the shock can get started ) only if the cooling rate is smaller than the energy deposition rate , i.e. , @xmath66 ( @xmath67 $ ] is the cooling function ) , or [ eq : lum_fizzle ] r_ej 20  pc  l_ej,38 ^ 1/3 n^-2/3 _ -22 ^ -1/3 , where @xmath68 is the cooling function in units of @xmath69 erg @xmath70 s@xmath14 . the above criterion ( eq . [ eq : lum_fizzle ] ) for the luminosity driven models is quite different from the criterion that we now derive for the widely used thermal explosion models with energy and mass addition ( tea model in section [ sec : fb_pres ] ) . since energy is _ added _ to the ( possibly dense ) pre - existing medium , cooling in this model can be substantial . in contrast , since the ejecta density is low , cooling losses are smaller in the overwriting models ( ke , teo ) . for tea models to launch a shock , radiative losses over the timescale in which the shock from a point explosion reaches the ejecta radius , [ eq : t_therm ] t_ej = e_ej^-1/2 r_ej^5/2 ^1/2 , should be smaller than the energy deposited ( here @xmath39 is the density of the medium in which energy is injected , not necessarily the ism density ) ; i.e. , [ eq : cool_cond ] n^2 t_ej 3 e_ej/4r_ej^3 . plugging in the expression for @xmath71 , we get [ eq : eadd_fizzle ] r_ej 31  pc  e_ej , 51 ^ 3/11 _ -22 ^ -2/11 n^-5/11 . this condition is much more restrictive than the one obtained by replacing @xmath71 in eq . [ eq : cool_cond ] by the cfl stability timestep . moreover , this is the appropriate timescale to use because the relevant timescale for the injected energy to couple to the ism is the thermalization time ( @xmath71 ) . @xcite and @xcite have used similar arguments and derived results not too different from ours for the thermal explosion addition models . a slight difference from our work is that they consider energy deposition over a resolution element ( a necessity because of a larger range of scales in cosmological galaxy simulations ) , but we allow for energy deposition over a resolved region . @xcite have expressed their resolution limit in terms of the cooling rate per unit mass and @xcite in terms of the post - shock temperature ; we use the cooling function ( @xmath72 ) to express the critical radius within which the energy needs to be deposited .      in models where the energy and mass densities are overwritten within @xmath24 , the condition for overcoming cooling losses and launching a shock is @xmath73 where ejecta number density @xmath74 and @xmath75 ; note that this expression is different from eq . [ eq : cool_cond ] in that the ejecta density is used instead of the ism density . the overwrite models ( ke , teo ) behave quite differently from addition ( tea , ld ) models because a larger ejecta radius means a smaller density ejecta to which energy is added . replacing the ism density by the ejecta density in eq . [ eq : t_therm ] gives @xmath76 , and the condition for energy thermalization is r_ej 0.003  pc  m_ej,^5/4 _ -22 ^ 1/2 e_ej,51 ^ -3/4 . in order to avoid radiative losses the ejecta radius should be _ larger _ than above . this early cooling of the mass loaded sn ejecta , responsible for creating cold filaments in young sne ( e.g. , @xcite ) , is physical ( unlike fizzling out of the energy addition models ) and should reduce the energy available to drive the sn . all our simulations use an ejecta radius much greater than this limit . @xcite ( hereafter cc85 ) found analytic solutions for a luminosity driven wind with a fixed injection radius . luminosity injection is expected to drive both an outer shock bounding the bubble and a wind that shocks within the hot bubble at the termination shock ( see fig . 1 in @xcite ; see also ld run in fig . [ fig : rho_vs_r_cc85 ] ) . in this section we show that for a small number of sne ( c.f . [ eq : cc_crit ] ) the sn ejecta does not thermalize within the termination shock . in that case , the density inside the bubble is much lower than the cc85 wind because most sne occur in the dilute bubble created by earlier sne and the thermalization radius is comparable to the outer shock radius . this has important implications on cooling and luminosity of sn ejecta . following @xcite , the outer shock radius of a luminosity driven bubble is given by @xmath77 , velocity by @xmath78 , and the post - shock pressure by @xmath79 . assuming a steady superwind , the ram pressure at the termination shock ( @xmath80 ; the wind is assumed to be supersonic at this radius ) is @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the wind velocity , @xmath83 is the density upstream of the termination shock , and @xmath84 is the mass injection rate . the wind termination shock ( @xmath80 ) is located where the wind ram pressure balances the bubble pressure ; i.e. , @xmath85 using @xmath53 and @xmath86 gives , [ eq : r_ts ] ( ) ^1/2 0.08 e_ej , 51 ^ -1/12 m_ej , ^1/4 n^-1/6 r_os , 2 ^ -1/3 t_sn , 0.3 ^ -1/6 , where @xmath87 is the outer shock radius in units of 100 pc , @xmath88 is the time between sne normalized to 0.3 myr ( corresponding to @xmath59 ) ; we have used @xmath57 and @xmath89 . the ratio @xmath90 depends very weakly on time ( @xmath91 ) ; this comes from the time dependence of @xmath51 in eq . [ eq : r_ts ] . the reverse shock for an isolated sn very quickly ( at the beginning of sedov - taylor stage ) collapses to a point but the termination shock for a sb is present at all times . thus the non - radiative termination shock can power a sb long after the outer shock becomes radiative , unlike a sn which dies off shortly after the outer shock becomes radiative ( see section [ sec : energy_budget ] for our results from simulations ) . the condition for the existence of a smooth cc85 wind is that the ejecta thermalization radius should be smaller than the termination shock radius . the superwind is mass loaded by previous sne ( the bubble density in the absence of mass loading is quite small because most of the mass is swept up in the outer shell ) . the swept up mass till radius @xmath92 in a cc85 wind is @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the wind density profile ; here we have assumed that the swept up mass is dominated by the supersonic portion of the wind . now the thermalization radius ( the radius within which the deposited energy is thermalized and which should correspond to cc85 s injection radius ) of the ejecta is where the swept up mass roughly equals the ejecta mass , or [ eq : rth_cc ] r_th v_ts t_sn 3  kpc  e_ej , 51 ^ 1/2 m_ej , ^-1/2 t_sn , 0.3 . since the thermalization radius is quite large , a thermalized cc85 solution will only occur for large clusters ( with shorter @xmath28 , the time lag between sne ) ; for modest star clusters the ejecta will only thermalize beyond the termination shock . of course , the thermalization radius can not be smaller than the size of the star cluster launching the energetic ejecta . [ eq : r_ts ] and @xmath77 , the termination shock radius can be expressed as @xmath95 where @xmath96 is time in units of 0.3 myr . a cc85 solution will appear only if this termination shock radius is larger than the thermalization radius ( eq . [ eq : rth_cc ] ) ; i.e. , if [ eq : cc_crit ] t_sn,0.3 0.007 e_ej,51 ^ -9/26 t_0.3 ^ 4/13 n^-3/13 m_ej,^15/26 . this means that @xmath97 ( recall that @xmath33 , where @xmath60 myr is the cluster lifetime and @xmath30 is the number of sne ) is required for a cc85 wind to appear by 30 myr . thus , a thermally driven cc85 wind occurs only for a sufficiently big starburst , with a large mass loading , and at late times . in this section we present the results from our one - dimensional numerical simulations . we vary the ism density and sn injection parameters to assess when sn energy can significantly affect the ism , both with and without cooling . we also numerically verify the various analytic constraints presented in section [ sec : anal ] . we discuss the structure of a radiative sb and compare the energetics of isolated sne and sbs . while isolated sne lose most of their mechanical energy by a few myr , sbs can retain up to @xmath2 of the input energy long after the outer shock becomes radiative . thus , sbs , and not isolated sne , are the viable energy sources for global , galactic - scale feedback . in section [ sec : b_cond ] we briefly discuss the impact of magnetic fields and thermal conduction on sbs . the sn shock is launched once a protoneutron star forms at the center of a massive evolved star ( with size @xmath98 cm ) . in the ejecta dominated state ( when the swept up ism mass is less than the ejecta mass ) the cold ejecta is dominated by kinetic energy ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in our ` realistic ' simulations ( ke models ; see section 2 ) we choose the ejecta to have a constant density and a velocity proportional to the radius ( homologous expansion ; this is a similarity solution for the freely expanding ejecta ) within the ejecta . the sn shock develops a reverse shock after sweeping up its own mass in the ism ; this slows down the ejecta and communicates the presence of the ism to the supersonic ejecta . in this section we compare the evolution of _ adiabatic _ ( cooling is turned off ) ke models with different parameters , highlighting the importance of having a small ejecta radius ( @xmath24 ) even in absence of cooling for overwrite ( ke , teo ) models . we have verified that kinetic explosion ( ke ) and thermal explosion overwrite ( teo ) models behave in a similar fashion . [ cc][][1.][0]@xmath99   , title=""fig : "" ]    figure [ fig : rho_vs_r ] shows the density profile as a function of radius ( normalized to the self similar scaling , @xmath100^{1/5}$ ] , where @xmath101 ) for different realistic runs ( results are similar for teo models ) with @xmath102 at 10 myr . the runs with a large ejecta radius ( 100 pc ) give a smaller outer shock radius because most of the energy is overwritten without being thermalized ( see section [ sec : over ] for a discussion ) . the problem is worse for larger @xmath30 ( shorter @xmath28 ) , as expected from eq . [ eq : r_therm ] . the normalized location of the outer shock falls almost on top of each other for a small ejecta radius ( @xmath103 pc ) . as expected , the shock is weaker , broader , and with a modest density jump for a smaller number of sne . while the ke model is most realistic , we expect other models in section [ sec : fb_pres ] to give a similar location for the outer shock after the swept - up ism mass equals the ejecta mass and the shock is in the sedov - taylor regime . the structure within the bubble depends on sn prescription , as we show in section [ sec : cc85_sims ] . [ ] [ ] [ 1.][0]@xmath104 [ ] [ ] [ 1.][0]@xmath105 ) is sufficiently small ; otherwise energy is overwritten before getting coupled to the ism . there is no such problem for energy addition and luminosity driven models . at early times the outer shock radius scales with the sedov - taylor scaling ( @xmath65 ) and later on , after many sne go off , it steepens ( @xmath106 ) . [ fig : r_vs_t],title=""fig : "" ]    figure [ fig : r_vs_t ] shows the location of the outer shock ( measured by its peak density ) as a function of time for various models ( ke , ld , tea ) and sn parameters in absence of cooling . the solid line at the bottom shows the transition from a single blast wave ( outer shock radius , @xmath65 ) to a continuously driven bubble ( @xmath106 ; @xcite ) for @xmath59 run . the runs with more sne show such a transition very early on . the dot - dashed line shows the outer shock radius for the ke run using a large ejecta radius violating the criterion in eq . [ eq : r_therm ] ; the outer shock radius is much smaller than expected because energy is overwritten before it energizes the hot bubble ( see section [ sec : over ] ) . the luminosity driven ( ld ) and kinetic explosion ( ke ) models agree only if the ejecta radius satisfies eq . [ eq : r_therm ] for ke models ( we have verified that this constraint also applies to the thermal explosion overwrite [ teo ] models ) . tea ( thermal explosion addition ) runs and ld runs fall on top of each other for both choices of @xmath24 ( 2 , 100 pc ) . the outer shock radii for the runs with @xmath107 pc increase only after a thermalization time ( eq . [ eq : t_therm ] ; although in this case @xmath39 is not the ism density but the much lower density of the bubble within which energy is added ) . [ cc][][1.][0]@xmath99 , but not for ke / tea models with @xmath59 ; the smooth cc85 wind is identified by the density profile varying @xmath108 between the ejecta radius and the termination shock ( various regions have been marked for the ld run ) . the cc85 wind density using @xmath37 is slightly smaller for the ke model compared to the tea model because density is overwritten ( and hence mass is lost ) in ke models . [ fig : rho_vs_r_cc85],title=""fig : "" ]    in this section we show that a simple steady wind , as predicted by cc85 , exists within the bubble only if the number of sne is sufficiently large ( see section [ sec : cc85 ] ) . figure [ fig : rho_vs_r_cc85 ] shows the density profile as a function of the scaled radius for various models . the solid line shows density for a luminosity driven ( ld ) model with @xmath59 and @xmath103 pc ; various regions for the smooth cc85 wind within the bubble are marked . the superwind has a structure identical to the cc85 wind ; the sonic point is just beyond the energy injection radius ( 2 pc ) . the wind shocks at the termination shock ( @xmath80 ) where the wind ram pressure balances the bubble pressure . the ratio of the termination shock and the outer shock ( @xmath51 ) is @xmath109 , in good agreement with eq . [ eq : r_ts ] . for comparison , figure [ fig : rho_vs_r_cc85 ] also shows the density profiles for the kinetic explosion ( ke ) and thermal explosion addition ( tea ) models with the same parameters . while the outer shock radius agree for these runs , the density profiles within the bubble are quite different . the most blatant difference , for runs with @xmath59 , is the absence of a cc85 wind in ke and tea models . in accordance with the discussion in section [ sec : cc85 ] , sn shocks do not thermalize within the termination shock for a small number of sne ( see eqs . [ eq : rth_cc ] & [ eq : cc_crit ] ) ; therefore a smooth cc85 wind is not expected in any model with small @xmath30 except ld .    only for a large enough @xmath30 and late enough times does a cc85 wind start to appear within the hot bubble . figure [ fig : rho_vs_r_cc85 ] includes the density profiles for kinetic explosion ( ke ) and tea models using @xmath37 ( the inner [ outer ] radius of the computational domain for these runs is 0.5 pc [ 5 kpc ] ; @xmath110 pc is chosen to satisfy the constraint in eq . [ eq : r_therm ] ) . clearly , in these cases we see the appearance of the cc85 wind solution within the termination shock because the injected energy is thermalized . for the ke run with @xmath37 one can still see the internal shocks due to isolated sne interacting with the superwind . the density profile for the ke model using @xmath111 is shown by the dotted line in figure [ fig : rho_vs_r ] . in agreement with eq . [ eq : r_ts ] , the ratio @xmath90 increases with an increasing @xmath30 . for @xmath111 thermalization is less complete as compared to @xmath37 , but happens within the termination shock . in comparison , a clear termination shock is absent for @xmath59 because the thermalization radius is larger than the termination shock radius ( see eq . [ eq : cc_crit ] ) .      in this section we study the effects of radiative cooling on sne and sbs . we focus on a few aspects : the fizzling out of thermal feedback in some models in which energy is not injected over a sufficiently small scale ; comparison of cooling losses and mechanical energy retained by radiative snrs and sbs ; the influence of magnetic fields and thermal conduction .      as we mentioned in section [ sec : cool_cond ] , some models ( tea , ld ) in which we _ add _ sn thermal energy in a dense ism , over a large radius , can suffer unphysical catastrophic radiative cooling . in such cases a hot bubble is not even created and sn feedback has no effect , whatsoever . early sn feedback simulations suffered from this problem because of low resolution . , ke model indeed shows a bubble and a forward shock . also shown is the density profile for tea model with a lower density ( 5 @xmath16 ) ism ; at later times it shows a bubble which pushes the shell outwards . the outer shock radius is larger for a lower density ism because @xmath112 . [ fig : fizzling ] ]    figure [ fig : fizzling ] shows the density profiles at 3 myr for three of our energy injection models ( ke , ld , tea ) with @xmath59 and the ism density of 20 @xmath16 . the ejecta radius is chosen to be large such that it violates conditions in eqs . [ eq : lum_fizzle ] & [ eq : eadd_fizzle ] . the figure shows a comparison of the luminosity driven ( ld ) and thermal explosion addition ( tea ) models that fizzle out , and kinetic explosion ( ke ) model which shows a hot , dilute bubble . thus , our results are in agreement with the analytical considerations of section [ sec : cool_cond ] . the outer shock location for the ke model roughly agrees with the self similar scaling of @xcite if the luminosity is reduced by a factor @xmath113 ; this is comparable to the fraction of mechanical energy retained by sbs after the outer shock becomes radiative ( see section [ sec : energy_budget ] and the right panel of fig . [ fig : rad_loss_time ] ) .    for most runs in figure [ fig : fizzling ] we have chosen a rather high density ( @xmath114 @xmath16 ) compared to the critical values in eqs . [ eq : lum_fizzle ] & [ eq : eadd_fizzle ] . for lower densities ( e.g. , 5 @xmath16 for tea model in fig . [ fig : fizzling ] ) we find that the energy does not couple at early times . energy injection excites large amplitude sound waves and associated density perturbations , such that at late times the lowest density regions no longer violate eqs . [ eq : lum_fizzle ] & [ eq : eadd_fizzle ] . after this , a hot bubble starts to grow because of energy injection in a dilute medium ( see dotted line in fig . [ fig : fizzling ] ) , and eventually the outer shock radius starts to agree with analytic estimates . this and later sections , which study the influence of radiative cooling on sbs and snrs , use the realistic kinetic explosion ( ke ) model for supernova energy injection with ejecta radius @xmath103 pc . however , we have verified that other models discussed in section [ sec : fb_pres ] give similar results , as long as the conditions in section [ sec : anal ] are satisfied . spherical adiabatic blast waves , both snrs and sbs , have shells with finite thickness . an estimate for the shell thickness is obtained by assuming that all the swept - up ism mass lies in a shell and that the post shock density is 4 times the ism density for a strong shock ; this gives @xmath115 . of course , the shock transition layer is unresolved in simulations , and in reality is of order the mean free path . the structure of an adiabatic blast waves is fairly simple . the density jump at the shock is 4 for a strong shock , and as the shock becomes weaker the density jump decreases and the shell becomes broader . eventually , the outer shock is so weak that it no longer compresses gas irreversibly , but instead becomes a sound wave with compressions and rarefactions ( see fig . 2 in @xcite ) . since the evolution of isolated snrs with cooling has been thoroughly studied in past ( e.g. , @xcite ; hereafter t98 ) , we only highlight the differences between isolated snrs and sbs . the fundamental difference between the two is that snrs suffer catastrophic losses just after they become radiative because , unlike in sbs , there is no energy injection after this stage . in sbs , the cool ( yet dilute ) , fast sn ejecta periodically thermalizes within the bubble and powers it long after the forward shock becomes radiative . this keeps the radiative forward shock moving ( like a pressure - driven snowplow ) , as long as sne go off within the hot bubble . the structure of a radiative shell is quite complex . the shell become radiative when the cooling time of the post - shock gas is shorter than its expansion time ( which is of order the age of the blast wave ) . moving inward from the upstream ism , the outer shock transition happens over a mean free path , which is followed by a thin radiative relaxation layer of order the cooling length ( see , for example , pp . 226 - 229 of @xcite and the top - right panel of fig . [ fig : d_t ] ) . the radiative relaxation layer is followed by a dense shell , which is separated by a contact discontinuity from the dilute hot bubble . in steady state , radiative cooling is concentrated at two unresolved boundary layers , the outer radiative relaxation layer and the inner contact discontinuity . here the density is high and the temperature is conducive to radiative cooling . figure [ fig : d_t ] shows the zoomed - in density and temperature structure of the radiative shell for a sb ( with @xmath111 ; upper panels ) and a snr ( @xmath116 ; lower panels ) using high resolution ( with 16384 grid - points ) runs . it clearly shows an outer radiative shock and an inner contact discontinuity . within the contact discontinuity of the sb ( @xmath111 ) is the shocked sn ejecta ; figure [ fig : rho_vs_r_cc85 ] shows the full structure of a superwind within the sb . just when the outer shock becomes radiative the coolest / densest part is compressed by high pressure regions sandwiching it ( left panels of fig . [ fig : d_t ] ) . after a sound crossing time the post - shock region is roughly isobaric and in the pressure - driven snowplow phase ( right panels of fig . [ fig : d_t ] ) .    unlike sbs , for isolated snrs there is no energy injection at later times ; the pressure in the bubble falls precipitously after the outer shock becomes radiative at @xmath1170.05 myr . by @xmath118 myr the bubble pressure becomes comparable to the ism pressure , the shell density falls and it becomes momentum conserving with a velocity comparable to the sound speed in the ism . at even later times ( @xmath4 few myr ) the hot bubble just oscillates as a weak acoustic wave .    /[total cooling rate ] ) and bubble ( [ bubble cooling rate]/[total cooling rate ] ) for ke models ( @xmath111 ) with and without conduction ( the run with thermal conduction is discussed in section [ sec : b_cond ] ) . most radiative energy losses happen at the radiative relaxation layer ahead of the dense shell . at late times , as the outer shock weakens , radiative losses in the bubble become more dominant . bubble is comparatively more radiative ( in fact , bubble losses exceed shell losses after 5 myr ) with conduction because of mass loading of the bubble by evaporation from the dense shell . results from the high resolution run and the luminosity driven ( ld ) model are similar . the minimum in fractional radiative losses corresponds to the time when the outer shock becomes radiative . [ fig : rad_ratio ] ]    figure [ fig : rad_ratio ] shows the distribution of radiative losses in the shell and in the bubble ( shell is defined as the outermost region where density is above 1.01 times the ism density ; bubble comprises of all the grid points with radius smaller than the inner shell radius ) for a superbubble with @xmath111 ; results from runs with and without thermal conduction are shown . here we only discuss the run without conduction ; the run with conduction is highlighted in section [ sec : b_cond ] . unlike figure [ fig : d_t ] , here we use our standard resolution runs ( 1024 grid points ) because we are running for a much longer time . results from the higher resolution runs match our standard runs , highlighting the fact that the volume integrated cooling is the same even if the radiative relaxation layer and the contact discontinuity are unresolved . the time and volume integrated losses ( @xmath119 ) in bubble and shell are sampled appropriately and differentiated in time to obtain their respective cooling rates . as already discussed , cooling is concentrated at the radiative relaxation layer , which is included in the shell , and at the contact discontinuity , part of which is included in the bubble . consistent with our previous discussion , most radiative losses are concentrated in the shell . fractional radiative losses in the bubble ( concentrated at the contact discontinuity ) are @xmath120 , which increase with time as the outer shock becomes weaker . the structure of a radiative shock is well known ( see , e.g. , pp . 226 - 229 in @xcite ) . applying mass and momentum conservation across the radiative relaxation layer in the shock frame , and assuming the same temperature upstream / downstream of it ( see the top - right panel of fig . [ fig : d_t ] for different regions of the outer shock ) gives @xmath121 ( eq . 16.36 in @xcite ) , where @xmath122 is the density downstream ( upstream ) of the radiative relaxation layer , @xmath123 ( @xmath124 ) is the upstream ( downstream ) velocity in the shock rest frame , and @xmath55 is the isothermal sound speed of upstream ism ( at @xmath125 k below which radiative cooling vanishes ) . thus , we expect larger density jump across stronger shocks ( @xmath126 ) . this is evident from the shell density for the two cases ( @xmath127 ) in figure [ fig : d_t ] . the thickness of the cold , dense shell can be estimated by equating the swept - up ism mass with the mass in the constant density shell ; @xmath128 . this thickness is quite small , with @xmath129 for a 100 km s@xmath14 shock . this estimate agrees with our results in figure [ fig : d_t ] , and as predicted , the shell is thicker for a smaller @xmath30 and becomes thicker with time as the shock becomes weaker .    the thickness of the radiative relaxation layer can also be estimated . the size of the radiative relaxation layer is @xmath130 ( @xmath130 is the distance behind the outer shock after which the advection time becomes longer than the cooling time ) , such that [ eq : rl ] _ 0^l_cool = _ 0^t_cool dt = t_cool , where @xmath131 is the velocity in the relaxation layer in the shock rest frame . while this equation can only be solved after numerically solving for the structure of the relaxation layer , we can make an order of magnitude estimate . the integral on the lhs of eq . [ eq : rl ] can be estimated as @xmath132 , where @xmath133 is the geometric mean of the velocity at the front of the relaxation layer ( @xmath134 for a strong shock ) and just downstream of it ( @xmath135 ) . similarly , the cooling time @xmath136 in eq . [ eq : rl ] can be estimated by using a geometric mean of densities across the relaxation layer ; i.e. , @xmath137 , where @xmath138 and we can use the peak of the cooling function for @xmath139 and @xmath72 . putting this all together gives , l_cool ~a_t ( ) , which is @xmath140 pc for fiducial numbers , far from being resolved even in our highest resolution runs . while the transition layers ( contact discontinuity and radiative relaxation layer ) where all our cooling is concentrated are unresolved , we find that the volume integrated quantities such as radiative losses , kinetic / thermal energy in shell / bubble are converged even at our modest ( 1024 grid points ; results are similar even for 256 grid points ) resolution .      ) have been combined cumulatively ( see eq . [ eq : cum ] ) , assuming that sne go off independently in the ism . pre - radiative phase energetics are similar but isolated snrs are extremely deficient in mechanical energy ( after 1 myr ) as compared to a sb with the same energy input . the arrow on top right shows the bubble thermal energy at the end for an adiabatic sb run . isolated sn results are only shown till 2 myr because snrs become weak sound waves by then . [ fig : energy ] ]    in this section we focus on the energetics of sb shell / bubble and compare it with the results from isolated snrs . we define the shell to be the outermost region where the density is larger than 1.01 times the ism density . all gas at radii smaller than the shell inner radius is included in the bubble ( this definition is convenient but not very precise as it includes small contribution from the unshocked sn ejecta ) . figure [ fig : energy ] shows a comparison of kinetic and thermal energies in bubble and shell as a function of time for a sb driven by @xmath141 sne . the bubble kinetic energy is not included because it is much smaller . also included is a comparison of the same quantities for the same frequency of sne that go off independently . the results for multiple isolated sne are obtained by combining the single sn run at different times . we simply use the data at an interval of @xmath28 ( time between individual sne ) and add them to obtain total kinetic / thermal energy in the shell and bubble at a given time . for instance , the thermal energy in bubbles of all independent sne at time @xmath142 is obtained by summing up the bubble thermal energy from a single sn ( @xmath116 ) run at @xmath143 , @xmath28 , @xmath144 , ... , till @xmath142 . this is equivalent to a cumulative sum over time for a single sn run , [ eq : cum ] e_cum(t ) = _ i=0^i < n e(i t_sn ) = _ 0^t e(t^ ) dt^ , where @xmath145 stands for , say , bubble thermal energy and @xmath146 is the number of sne till time @xmath147 . @xcite have given analytic predictions for energy in different components of sbs : the total energy of the shell is @xmath148 ( @xmath149 of this is kinetic energy and @xmath150 is thermal ) and the thermal energy of the bubble is @xmath151 ( kinetic energy of the bubble is negligible ) . these analytic predictions agree well with our numerical results in the early adiabatic ( non - radiative ) sb phase in figure [ fig : energy ] . figure [ fig : energy ] shows that the sb shell loses most of its thermal energy catastrophically at @xmath152 myr ; the trough in shell thermal energy can be estimated by assuming that all the swept - up mass till then cools to the stable temperature ( @xmath17 k ) . the thermal energy of the cold shell increases after that as it sweeps up mass from the ism ; this is not a real increase in the thermal energy because the newly added material , which was previously part of the ism , simply becomes a part of the dense shell at the same temperature . the bubble thermal energy and the shell kinetic energy show only a slight decrease in slope after the radiative phase because they are energized by the non - radiative termination ( internal ) shock(s ) driven by sn ejecta . however , there are some losses because of cooling at the contact discontinuity ( see figs . [ fig : d_t ] & [ fig : rad_ratio ] ) . the shell kinetic energy and the bubble thermal energy in radiative sb simulations at 20 myr are roughly half of the values obtained in adiabatic simulations ( which agree with analytic predictions ) . thus , the mechanical energy retained in the sb is @xmath153 . this should be contrasted with the energy evolution in isolated snrs . the isolated snr becomes radiative much earlier ( @xmath117 0.05 myr ; when the shell thermal energy shown by dashed line flattens suddenly in fig . [ fig : energy ] ) because of a weaker shock compared to a sb . note that the energies for isolated sne in figure [ fig : energy ] are _ cumulative sums _ over time of a single sn run ( see eq . [ eq : cum ] ) . the bubble thermal energy and shell kinetic energy also drop for an individual snr after it becomes radiative ( albeit not catastrophically , unlike the shell thermal energy ; see fig . 3 in t98 ; this is the pressure - driven snowplow stage ) because of cooling at the contact discontinuity and adiabatic losses , and because there is no new energy source ( unlike the termination / internal shocks in a sb ) . the total mechanical energy in the bubble and shell of a single snr at the beginning of the momentum conserving phase ( 1 myr ; when bubble pressure is comparable to the ism pressure ) is @xmath154 erg , which is only 10% of the input energy ( see fig . 3 in t98 ) . this agrees with the energy fraction available as mechanical energy of the snr , as quoted by t98 . after a few myr the snr should be considered a non - energetic part of the ism , as the thermal energy of the swept up ism becomes larger than the snr s mechanical energy , and the bubble becomes a weak acoustic wave .    in order to compare isolated snrs and superbubbles over the cluster lifetime we must extrapolate our cumulative sn energies to 30 myr . this is also the relevant timescale for preventing large - scale galactic inflows from efficiently forming stars ( the free - fall timescale at @xmath155 kpc for galactic halos is few 10s of myr ) . for isolated snrs the shell kinetic energy + bubble thermal energy is @xmath47% of the input energy by 2 myr , and only 0.7% when extrapolated to 30 myr . we should not extrapolate the shell thermal energy because its rise at late times in figure [ fig : energy ] is due to the sweeping up of the ism into the shell , without an increase in the temperature . to conclude , isolated sn feedback is much weaker ( by a factor @xmath7 ) as compared to the feedback due to sbs over the cluster lifetime . the left panel of figure [ fig : rad_loss_time ] shows the total radiated energy over the whole computational domain as a function of time for an isolated snr ( @xmath116 ; solid line ) and for sbs ( dashed lines ) . the results are qualitatively different for sbs ( even for @xmath156 ) and isolated sne . while an isolated sn radiates almost all of the input energy ( @xmath47 erg ) over a myr timescale , sbs radiate a smaller fraction ( @xmath157 ) of their energy even till late times . the runs with smaller @xmath30 and larger density become radiative at an early time as the shock is weaker , but sb runs are qualitatively similar . unlike in isolated sne , a significant fraction of the input energy in sbs is retained in the bubble thermal energy and the shell kinetic energy ( @xmath158 ; see fig . [ fig : energy ] ) . the key reason for the difference between isolated sne and sbs is that in sbs the non - radiative termination / internal shocks keep the bubble overpressured but isolated sne , which do not have further energy input after the initial explosion , simply fizzle out soon after they become radiative . the right panel of figure [ fig : rad_loss_time ] shows the fraction of energy retained ( 1-the fraction radiated ) as a function of time for several runs . all sb runs , including a higher density run ( @xmath159 @xmath16 ) and the run with conduction ( see section [ sec : b_cond ] ) , show the asymptotic fraction of energy retained to be @xmath160 . in contrast , an isolated sn loses 90% of the input energy by few myr ( and almost all of it by 10 myr ; see also fig . [ fig : energy ] ) . radiative losses for an isolated snr at late times ( @xmath161 few myr ) are more than the energy input ( @xmath47 erg ) ; these come at the expense of the thermal energy of the swept - up ism . we can compare our results of coincident sne with the case of multiple sne distributed over space in a random manner . the two cases presented in figure [ fig : energy ] represent two extreme limits : spatially coincident sne in a sb and totally independent sne . for spatially distributed sne we expect results somewhere in between these two extremes . @xcite compare the total explosion energy that remains as the thermal energy of hot gas in the case of spatially distributed sn explosions . they study the effects of coherent explosions , as defined in @xcite , which implies that sne overlap before they become radiative . if the shell radius of a snr when it becomes radiative is @xmath162 and the corresponding time scale is @xmath163 , then for a sn rate density of @xmath164 , the coherency condition is that @xmath165 . @xcite compare the cases in which explosions occur coherently with those in which they do not . they find that a fraction @xmath166 of the explosion energy is retained in the gas with temperature @xmath167 k if the explosions occur coherently , and the fraction is @xmath168 if the explosions are incoherent . our results here for sbs correspond to the coherent case , since @xmath28 is always shorter than the cooling time of the gas in the bubble . therefore , our result of a fraction @xmath169 being retained as sb s mechanical energy is consistent with @xcite . since the ism is magnetized , we try to assess the qualitative effects of magnetic fields using an idealized high resolution ( 16384 grid points ) mhd simulation . we assume an azimuthal ( @xmath170 ) component of the magnetic field so that only magnetic pressure forces ( and no tension ) are present . we choose a plasma @xmath171 ( ratio of gas pressure and magnetic pressure ) of unity in the ism , and our sn ejecta is also magnetized with the same value of @xmath171 . since the ejecta is dominated by kinetic energy and the bubble is expanding , we do not expect magnetic fields to affect the bubble and the ejecta structure . however , the radiative shell is compressed because of cooling , and due to flux - freezing magnetic pressure is expected to build up in the dense shell . this is indeed what we find in our simulations with magnetic fields . the left panel of figure [ fig : dt_b_cond ] shows the zoomed - in density and temperature structure of the radiative outer shock with and without magnetic fields . the key difference between the hydro and mhd runs is that the dense shell in mhd has a lower density and is much broader . this is because magnetic pressure prevents the collapse of the dense shell . the dense shell ( @xmath172 in the left panel of fig . [ fig : dt_b_cond ] ) is magnetically dominated with plasma @xmath173 . the mhd run has two contact discontinuities ; one at the boundary of the hot bubble ( @xmath174 pc ) , and another at @xmath175 pc left ( right ) of which the plasma is dominated by thermal ( magnetic ) pressure . another important physical effect , especially in the hot bubble is thermal conduction . we carry out a 1024 resolution hydro run with thermal conduction to study its qualitative influence . however , it is difficult to determine the ism conductivity in a magnetized ( presumably turbulent ) plasma . therefore , we use the spitzer value with a suppression factor of 0.2 ( see eq . 11 in @xcite ) . moreover , since the bubble can become very hot such that the diffusion approximation breaks down , we limit the conductivity to an estimate of the free streaming diffusivity ( chosen to be 2.6 @xmath176 where @xmath177 is the local isothermal sound speed and @xmath92 is the radius ) . thermal conduction is operator split , and implemented fully implicitly through a tridiagonal solver using the code s hydro time step . conduction is expected to evaporate matter from the dense shell and deposit it into a conductive layer in the bubble ; in steady state the rate of conductive transport of energy from bubble to the shell is balanced by the rate of heat advection from shell to the bubble @xcite . the outer and termination shock locations are not affected much by conduction . however , the density and temperature structure in the hot bubble is affected significantly . without conduction the bubble is very hot ( @xmath178 k ) , but with conduction the temperature drops into the x - ray range ( @xmath179 k ) and density is higher . this can enhance the x - ray emissivity of sbs ; a rough estimate of hard x - ray luminosity ( @xmath180 over the hot bubble ) at 10 myr from the right panel of figure [ fig : dt_b_cond ] is few @xmath58 erg s@xmath14 ( which is @xmath181 the energy put in by sne by that time ) . since galactic superwinds are copious x - ray emitters , we expect thermal conduction to be a very important ingredient for explaining observations . figure [ fig : rad_ratio ] confirms that the fraction of radiative losses from the bubble is much higher with conduction than without conduction because of a higher density . however , the right panel of figure [ fig : rad_loss_time ] shows that the total fractional radiative losses with thermal conduction are only slightly higher compared to the non - conductive @xmath111 sb run . we emphasize that our treatment of magnetic fields and thermal conduction is extremely simplified . realistic calculations must be done in three dimensions with tangled magnetic fields and with anisotropic thermal conduction along fields lines . however , we expect the qualitative effects of realistic magnetic fields and thermal conduction to have some semblance with our simplified treatment . we have obtained several important results in this paper , on both numerical implementation of sn / sb feedback and on differences between isolated sne and sbs . sbs are a result of spatially and temporally correlated sne . since most massive stars are expected to be born in star clusters few 10s of pc in extent ( e.g. , @xcite ) , pre - sn stellar winds and first sne are expected to carve out a low density bubble , which by a fraction of myr encloses the whole star cluster ( see fig . [ fig : d_t ] ) . therefore , subsequent sne happen in the low density bubble and we are in the sb regime of coherent sne ( see @xcite ) . magnificent galactic outflows , such as m82 , are powered by multiple super - star - clusters and the problem of understanding coalescing sbs is important . star clusters more massive than @xmath182 ( and hence with @xmath183 sne ) are rare ( e.g. , see @xcite ) ; therefore , the superbubbles in m82 and in our @xmath111 sb model should be considered as giant bubbles driven by 100s of overlapping superbubbles due to individual star clusters . indeed , 100s of star clusters have been observed in the central few 100 pc of m82 ( @xcite ) . we note that vertical stratification is important for the acceleration and assimilation of the metal - rich bubble into the halo . in this paper we consider the idealized smaller - scale problem of the behavior of isolated snrs and multiple coincident sne within a sb in a uniform ism . some of our most important results are :    * our most realistic kinetic explosion ( ke ) models ( and other models in which sn energy is _ overwritten _ ) , in which the sn energy in kinetic form is overwritten in a small volume , give correct results only if the energy is deposited within a small length scale ( see section [ sec : over ] ) ; otherwise , energy is overwritten without coupling to the ism . this is true even without considering any radiative losses . * with cooling , if feedback energy is deposited within a length scale @xmath24 larger than the critical values mentioned in section [ sec : cool_cond ] , such that the input energy is radiated before it is thermalized , a hot bubble is not formed in the widely used luminosity driven and thermal explosion addition ( ld , tea ) models . thus sn fizzles out at early stages due to artificially large cooling losses . * with insufficient resolution and large ism densities the bubble fizzles out completely in the luminosity driven ( ld ) and thermal explosion addition ( tea ) models ( in which energy is _ added _ to the ism ; see section [ sec : fb_pres ] ) and can not have any effect on the ism ( see fig . [ fig : fizzling ] ) . as also pointed out previously ( e.g. , by @xcite ) , early galactic - scale sn feedback simulations failed mainly because of this . however , for a realistic sn ( as mimicked by our ke model ) a bubble is formed and subsequent sne occuring within the non - radiative bubble power the radiative outer shock . another , probably more serious , problem faced by numerical simulations is that the sn energy is not typically put in coherently over a small volume in space and within a short interval . feedback due to sne in young star clusters is expected to be coherent and much more effective than a similar number of isolated sne ( see figs . [ fig : energy ] , [ fig : rad_loss_time ] ) . for correlated sne , isolated sn bubbles overlap to form a superbubble which is powered by the non - radiative termination / internal shocks , long after the outer shock becomes radiative . in contrast , an isolated supernova becomes powerless a bit after ( @xmath184 myr ) the outer shock becomes radiative . * a smooth cc85 wind within the superbubble is possible only if the number of sne ( @xmath30 ) over the cluster lifetime is large ( i.e. , @xmath185 ) . only in these cases , individual sne going off inside the superbubble are able to thermalize within the termination shock . this result has implications for modeling the x - ray output , for example , in individual bubbles blown by star clusters and in the inner regions of galactic outflows , since the cc85 wind structure is often assumed where it may not be valid . * most of the radiative losses come from the unresolved radiative relaxation layer at the outer shock . the fractional radiative losses from the interior region , concentrated at the contact discontinuity between the shocked ism and the shocked ejecta , varies between @xmath186 , with larger losses occurring at later times . while these radiative layers are unresolved even in our highest resolution simulations , the volume integrated radiative losses in them converge even for a modest resolution . * as compared to isolated sne , superbubbles can retain a larger fraction of the initial energy of explosions as thermal / kinetic energy of the gas . isolated sne are mixed with the ism soon after they become radiative ; by few myr they are incapable of affecting the ism at all . while most energy is radiative away ( close to 100% , and not @xmath187% , as is often assumed ) for isolated sne over 10 myr , a sb can retain a fraction @xmath169 ( for @xmath15 @xmath16 ) as the bubble thermal energy + the shell kinetic energy . this fraction is only weakly affected by a higher ism density and by thermal conduction ( see the right panel of fig . [ fig : rad_loss_time ] ) . thus , sbs are expected to significantly affect even a dense ism . substantial radiative losses can partly explain the smaller observed bubble sizes compared to what is expected by modeling the stellar populations ( see @xcite for a summary ) . * the temperature profile of sbs strongly depend on thermal conduction , whose inclusion can decrease ( increase ) the temperature ( density ) and thereby enhance the x - ray luminosity . thermal conduction ( and other sources of mass loading of the hot bubble , such as turbulent mixing ) plays an important role in explaining the x - ray emission from galactic superbubbles because very little gas is expected to be in the x - ray emitting regime ( @xmath188 k ) in its absence ( see the right panel of fig . [ fig : dt_b_cond ] ) . our simple one - dimensional simulations show that isolated supernova remnants , owing to large radiative losses , are much weaker feedback agents compared to superbubbles driven by coherently overlapping supernovae . however , detailed three - dimensional calculations , particularly with a realistic distribution of stars in a cluster , and magnetic fields and thermal conduction , are required in order to make quantitative comparisons with observations . this will be done in future . ps thanks ramesh narayan for useful discussions . ps is partly supported by dst - india grant no . sr / s2/hep-048/2012 . ys is partly supported by rfbr ( project code 12 - 02 - 00917 ) . agertz , o. , teyssier , r. , & moore , b. 2011 , mnras , 410 , 1391 chevalier , r. 1974 , mnras , 169 , 229 chevalier , r. 1977 , ann . astr . , 15 , 175 chevalier , r. a. & clegg , a. w. 1985 , nature , 317 , 44 chevalier , r. a. & blondin , j. m. 1995 , apj , 444 , 312 cox , d. p. 1972 , apj , 178 , 159 creasey p. , theuns , t. , bower , r. g. , & lacey , c. g. 2011 , mnras , 415 , 3706 creasey , p. , theuns , t. , & bower , r. g. 2013 , mnras , 429 , 1922 cooper , j. l. , bicknell , g. v. , sutherland , r. s. , & bland - hawthorn , j. 2008 , apj , 674 , 157 dalla vecchia , c. & schaye , j. 2012 , mnras , 426 , 140 dubois , y. , teyssier , r. 2008 , a&a , 477 , 79 gerritsen , j. p. e. 1997 , phd thesis , university of groningen gnedin , n. y. 1998 , mnras , 297 , 407 guedes , j. , callegari , s. , madau , p. , & mayer , l. 2011 , 742 , 76 hayes , j. c. et al . 2006 , apjs , 165 , 188 hopkins , p. f. , quataert , e. , & murray , n. 2011 , mnras , 417 , 950 hopkins , p. f. , quataert , e. , & murray , n. 2012 , mnras , 421 , 3522 joung , m. k. r. & mac low , m. 2006 , apj , 653 , 1266 katz , n. 1992 , 391 , 502 kay , s. t. , pearce , f. r. , frenk , c. s. , & jenkins , a. 2002 , mnras , 330 , 113 larsen , s. s. 1999 , a&a supp . ser . , 139 , 393 leisawitz , d. , bash , f. n. , & thaddeus , p. 1989 , apjs , 70 , 731 mac low , m. , mccray , r. , & norman , m. l. 1989 , apj , 337 , 141 mac low , m. & ferrara , a. 1999 , apj , 513 , 142 mccray , r. & kafatos , m. 1987 , apj , 317 , 190 nath , b. b. & shchekinov , y. 2013 , apjl , 777 , 12 navarro , f. f. & white , s. d. m. 1993 , mnras , 265 , 271 oconnell , r. w. , gallagher , j. s. , hunter , d. a. , & colley , w. n. 1995 , apj , 446 , l1 oey , m. s. 2009 , aip conf . proc . , 1156 , 295 ( 2009 ) palous , j. , wnsch , r. , martnez - gonzlez , s. , hueyotl - zahuantitla , f. , silich , s. , & tenorio - tagle , g. 2013 , apj , 772 , 128 portegies zwart , s. f. , mcmillan , s. l. , & gieles , m. 2010 , ann . astr . , 2010 , 48 , 431 recchi , s. & hensler , g. 2013 , a&a , 551 , 41 roy , a. , nath , b. b. , sharma , p. , & shchekinov , y. 2013 , mnras , 434 , 3572 sharma , p. , parrish , i. j. , & quataert , e. 2010 , apj , 720 , 652 shu , f. h. , the physics of astrophysics , vol . ii , gas dynamics , university science books , 1992 silich , s. , tenorio - tagle , g. , torres - campos , a. , munz - tun , monreal - ibero , a. , & melo , v. 2009 , apj , 700 , 931 springel , v. & hernquist , l. 2003 , mnras , 339 , 289 springel , v. et al . 2005 , nature , 435 , 629 stinson , g. , seth , a. , katz , n. , wadsley , j. , governato , f. , & quinn , t. 2006 , mnras , 373 , 1074 stone , j. m. & norman , m. l. 1992 , apjs , 80 , 753 strickland , d. k. & stevens , i. r. 2000 , mnras , 314 , 511 strickland , d. k. & heckman , t. m. 2009 , apj , 697 , 2030 suchkov , a. a. , balsara , d. s. , heckman , t. m. , & leitherer , c. 1994 , apj , 430 , 511 sutherland , r. s. & dopita , m. a. 1993 , apjs , 88 , 253 tang , s. & wang , q. d. 2005 , apj , 628 , 205 tasker , e. j. & bryan , g. l. 2006 , apj , 641 , 878 thacker , r. j. & couchman , h. m. p. 2000 , apj , 545 , 728 thornton , k. , gaudlitz , m. , janka , h. , & steinmetz , m. 1998 , apj , 500 , 95 truelove , j. k. & mckee , c. f. 1999 , apjs , 120 , 299 tumlinson , j. , thom , c. , werk , j. k , prochaska , j. x. , tripp , t. m. , weinberg , d. h. , peeples , m. s. , omeara , j. m. , oppenheimer , b. d. , meiring , j. d. , katz , n. s. , dav , r. , ford , a. b. , & sembach , k. r. 2011 , science , 2011 , 334 , 948 vasiliev , e. o. , nath , b. b. , bondarev , r. , & shchekinov , y. 2014 , arxiv:1401.5070 weaver , r. , mccray , r. , castor , j. , shapiro , p. , & moore , r. 1977 , apj , 218 , 377 zhang , q. , fall , s. m. , & whitmore , b. c. 2001 , apj , 561 , 727","The text discusses the study of supernovae (sne) feedback in galaxies, specifically focusing on the role of supernovae explosions in shaping the structure and evolution of galaxies. The authors examine the effects of supernovae on the structure of galaxies, including the formation of superbubbles, and the impact of supernovae on the formation of stars and the distribution of gas within galaxies.

The text begins by discussing the role of gravity and dark energy in shaping the structure of the universe, and then","using idealized 1-d eulerian hydrodynamic simulations , we contrast the behavior of isolated supernovae with the superbubbles driven by multiple , collocated supernovae . continuous energy injection via successive supernovae going off within the hot / dilute bubble maintains a strong termination shock . 
 this strong shock keeps the superbubble over - pressured and drives the outer shock well after it becomes radiative . 
 isolated supernovae , in contrast , with no further energy injection , become radiative quite early ( @xmath0 myr , 10s of pc ) , and stall at scales @xmath1 pc . 
 we show that isolated supernovae lose almost all of their mechanical energy by a myr , but superbubbles can retain up to @xmath2 of the input energy in form of mechanical energy over the lifetime of the star cluster ( few 10s of myr ) . 
 these conclusions hold even in the presence of realistic magnetic fields and thermal conduction . 
 we also compare various recipes for implementing supernova feedback in numerical simulations . for various feedback prescriptions 
 we derive the spatial scale below which the energy needs to be deposited for it to couple to the interstellar medium ( ism ) . 
 we show that a steady thermal wind within the superbubble appears only for a large number ( @xmath3 ) of supernovae . for smaller clusters 
 we expect multiple internal shocks instead of a smooth , dense thermalized wind .

"since their first detection by cobe , the cmb temperature fluctuations have become an essential tool for constraining cosmological parameters . from the beginning of 2000 , new experiments have released data set of good quality up to the third acoustic peak . better constraints have been obtained on several cosmological parameters . nevertheless , it has been shown that even with precise measurements of the power spectrum , it is nearly impossible to distinguish models with the same physical parameters on the last scattering surface . basically , some degeneracies are inherent to the cmb . we consider in this work x ray clusters as an independent way for constraining cosmological parameters . in the present analysis we consider the data from cobe , boomerang , maxima and dasi . we analysed the likelihood of inflationary models with @xmath0 , @xmath1 as free cosmological parameters . this corresponds to @xmath2 models tested.to derive the likelihood values for the models we considered , we used the method developed in bartlett et al . ( 2000 ) , and already used in le dour et al . ( 2000 ) . the results are presented as two - dimensional contours plots of the likelihood projected onto various parameters planes . this 2-d presentation has the advantage of showing clearly all the degeneracies between parameters . the left contour plots of figure 1 show some degeneracies between our parameters . basically , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are strongly degenerated if only cmb data are used in parameter estimation . this means that one should consider another source of constraints , independent from cmb observations , for a better cosmological parameter estimation . we choose x - ray clusters as additional constraints . clusters are interesting object for which both the luminous baryonic mass ( x - ray emitting intracluster gas ) and the total gravitating mass can be determined . therefore , an upper limit on the fraction baryon , @xmath6 , can be estimated . results are not necessary in agreement allowing values between @xmath7 and @xmath8 . in this work , we consider the constraints given in sadat and blanchard 2001  @xcite for the baryon fraction : @xmath9 . the aim of this contribution being to show that clusters may help for breaking degeneracies shown by cmb parameters estimations , we did not consider constraints given by other groups . a better consideration of these different results on x - ray clusters will be found in douspis et al . ( 2001b ) . given the constraints of cmb and x - ray clusters , one could combined the two by multiplying the corresponding likelihood .    the right figure of fig . 1 shows the constraints from the combined analysis in the same plane as the left figure . we can see that the degeneracies are broken . confidence intervals are now determined for @xmath3 and @xmath4 . for both parameters , low values are preferred : @xmath10 and @xmath11 at 99% cl .    due to inherent degeneracies in the cmb it is nearly impossible to specify some of the cosmological parameter ; `` cross constraints '' are then necessary . this work is thus a preliminary view of the kind of constraints one would obtain in a near future , using last x  ray satellite data , and in a less near future the cmb satellite data ( map and planck ) .","Here's a concise and informative summary of the text:

**Key Points:**

1. The CMB (Cosmic Microwave Background) temperature fluctuations are a crucial tool for constraining cosmological parameters.
2. New experiments have provided high-quality data from 2000 onwards, improving constraints on cosmological parameters.
3. However, precise measurements of the power spectrum are challenging, and some degeneracies remain between models with the same physical parameters.

"[ cols= "" < , < "" , ]     after fixing compensator structure , coefficients @xmath0 are obtained by applying straightforward least squares optimization . + we should emphasize here that fitting has to be done for both real and imaginary part of @xmath1 $ ] , thus the actual compensator structure is twice that depicted in figure  [ fig : compensator_structure ] . +        simulation parameters for system * s * are as follows : symbol rate @xmath2 , carrier frequency @xmath3 , with 64qam input symbol sequence . nonlinear distortion subsystem * f * of * s * , used in simulation , is defined in , where the delays @xmath4 are given by the vector @xmath5 $ ] , with @xmath6 . digital simulation of the continuous part of * s * was done by representing continuous signals by their discrete counterparts , obtained by sampling with high sampling rate @xmath7 . as input to * s * , we assume periodic 64qam symbol sequence , with period @xmath8 . this period length is used for generating input / output data for fitting coefficients @xmath0 , as well as generating input / output data for performance validation . + in figure  [ fig : evm_comparison ] we present evm obtained for different compensator structures , as well as output evm with no compensation , and case with ideal compensator @xmath9 . as can be seen from figure  [ fig : evm_comparison ] , compensator fitted using the proposed structure in figure  [ fig : compensator_structure ] outperforms other compensators , and gives output evm almost identical to the ideal compensator . this result was to be expected , since model in figure  [ fig : compensator_structure ] approximates the original system * s * very closely , and thus is capable of approximating system @xmath10 closely as well . this is not the case for compensators modeled with simple volterra series , due to inherently long ( or more precisely infinite ) memory introduced by the lti part of * s*. even if we use noncausal volterra series model ( i.e. @xmath11 ) , which is expected to capture true dynamics better , we are still unable to get good fitting of the system * s * , and consequently of the compensator @xmath12 . + advantage of the proposed compensator structure is not only in better compensation performance , but also in that it achieves better performance with much more efficient strucuture . that is , we need far less coefficients in order to represent nonlinear part of the compensator , in both least squares optimization and actual implementation ( table  [ table ] ) . in table [ table ] we can see a comparison in the number of coefficients between different compensator structures , for nonlinear subsystem parameter value @xmath13 . data in the first column is number of coefficients ( i.e. basis elements ) needed for general volterra model , i.e. coefficients which are optimized by least squares . the second column shows actual number of coefficients used to build compensator . least squares optimization yields many nonzero coefficients , but only subset of those are considered significant and thus used in actual compensator implementation . coefficient is considered significant if its value falls above a certain treshold @xmath14 , where @xmath14 is chosen such that increase in evm after zeroing nonsignificant coefficients is not larger than 1% of the best achievable evm ( i.e. when all basis elements are used for building compensator ) . from table [ table ] we can see that for case 3 volterra structure , 10 times more coefficients are needed in order to implement compensator , than in the case of our proposed structure . and even when such a large number of coefficients is used , its performance is still below the one achieved by this new compensator model . in this paper , we propose a novel explicit expression of the equivalent baseband model , under assumption that the passband nonlinearity can be described by a volterra series model with the fixed degree and memory depth . this result suggests a new , non - obvious , analytically motivated structure of digital precompensation of passband nonlinear distortions caused by power amplifiers , in digital communication systems . it has been shown that the baseband equivalent model can be written as a series connection of a fixed degree and low memory volterra model , and a long memory discrete lti system , called reconstruction filter . frequency response of the reconstruction filter is shown to be smooth , hence well aproximable by low order polynomials . parameters of such a model ( and accordingly of the predistorter ) can be obtained by applying simple least squares optimization to the input / output data measured from the system , thus implying low implementation complexity . state of the art implementations of dpd , have long memory requirements in the nonlinear subsystem , but structure of our baseband equivalent model suggests that the long memory requirements are shifted from the nonlinear part , to the lti part , which consists of fir filters and is easy to implement in digital circuits , giving it advantage of much lower complexity . we also argued that this baseband model , and its corresponding dpd structure , can be readily extended to ofdm modulation . simulation results have shown that by using this new dpd structure , significant reduction in nonlinear distortion caused by the rf pa can be achieved , while utilizing full frequency band , and thus effectively using maximal input symbol rate . the authors are grateful to dr . yehuda avniel for bringing researchers from vastly different backgrounds to work together on the tasks that led to the writing of this paper . l. ding , g. t. zhou , d. r. morgan , z. ma , j. s. kenney , j. kim , and c. r. giardina , `` a robust digital baseband predistorter constructed using memory polynomials , '' _ ieee trans . 1 , pp.159 -

The method is based on a novel structure that combines a fixed-degree and low-memory Volterra model with a long-memory discrete linear time-invariant (LTI) system.

The proposed structure is designed to approximate the original system's behavior, which is modeled using a fixed-degree and infinite-memory Volterra model. This structure is more efficient and simpler to implement","we consider discrete - time ( dt ) systems s in which a dt input is first transformed to a continuous - time ( ct ) format by phase - amplitude modulation , then modified by a non - linear ct dynamical transformation f , and finally converted back to dt output using an ideal de - modulation scheme . assuming that f belongs to a special class of ct volterra series models with fixed degree and memory depth 
 , we provide a complete characterization of s as a series connection of a dt volterra series model of fixed degree and memory depth , and an lti system with special properties . 
 the result suggests a new , non - obvious , analytically motivated structure of digital compensation of analog nonlinear distortions ( for example , those caused by power amplifiers ) in digital communication systems . 
 we also argue that this baseband model , and its corresponding digital compensation structure , can be readily extended to ofdm modulation . 
 results from a matlab simulation are used to demonstrate effectiveness of the new compensation scheme , as compared to the standard volterra series approach .

"in recent years the idea that the ground state of nuclear matter at high density contains a bose condensate of kaons has received considerable attention . the existence of this novel state of matter is suggested by the attractive _ s_-wave kaon - nucleon interactions found in low energy effective chiral lagrangians , which , by construction , preserve the symmetries of qcd . this is supported experimentally by kaonic atom data which indicate @xcite a strongly attractive @xmath1 optical potential . attractive kaon - nucleon interactions imply that in dense matter , such as that in the interior of neutron stars , the effective kaon mass is lower than in free space . it could thus be energetically favorable for leptons in the matter to convert to kaons via strangeness changing interactions , in which case the lowest energy kaon mode becomes macroscopically populated , forming a condensate .    since the original suggestion by kaplan and nelson@xcite , studies of kaon condensation and kaon propagation in the nuclear medium can broadly be divided into three categories : studies of the basic interactions , consequences for heavy - ion collisions and astrophysical implications . a number of studies have been aimed at improving the description of kaon - nucleon interactions over that of the original model . brown , lee , rho and thorsson@xcite included all terms to next - to - leading order ( @xmath2 ) in chiral perturbation theory , and fitted the expansion parameters to @xmath3 scattering lengths . lee , brown , min and rho@xcite included all terms to next - to - next - to - leading order ( @xmath4 ) in chiral perturbation theory and also fitted kaonic atom data . have also included the @xmath5 ( which dominates the low - energy @xmath6 interaction ) , four - baryon interactions , and pauli blocking . other noteworthy studies are those of ref.@xcite , concerning the effect of kaon - nucleon correlations , and the work of the kyoto group ( see e.g. ref.@xcite ) . waas , kaiser , and weise@xcite have recently investigated kaon modes in matter using a multichannel k - matrix analysis . for our purposes , it is worth mentioning that the majority of these more refined investigations have shown that the basic mechanism for kaon condensation , namely the existence of an attractive interaction , is robust . as regards heavy ion collisions , strangeness is conserved on the relevant timescales and a kaon condensate is not likely to form . however , modification of the kaon modes following from the chiral lagrangian could have consequences in kaon flow@xcite , for subthreshold production of kaons@xcite , or for the @xmath7-meson peak in dilepton spectra@xcite . another major direction that investigations have taken is to study the astrophysical consequences of the formation of a kaon condensate ( the effects appear to be reduced if hyperons are also present @xcite , a possibility that we do not consider here ) . the presence of such a condensate considerably enhances the proton concentration which leads to a softer equation of state ( eos ) and a lower maximum mass for the cold neutron star . the actual value of this maximum mass is dependent on the nuclear eos , but for the non - relativistic eos employed here it is quite close @xcite to the lower limit of @xmath8 set by psr 1913 + 16 @xcite . an interesting effect occurs when the neutron star has just formed since electron neutrinos are trapped for about 1015 s ( also the entropy / baryon is @xmath9 , but this plays a lesser role ) . the changes in the stellar composition induced by trapping increase the threshold for kaon condensation . this stiffens the eos and allows a maximum mass which is @xmath10 larger than in the absence of trapped neutrinos . thus there is the possibility of metastable neutron stars which become black holes after about 1015 s when the trapped neutrinos have left @xcite . this could account for the fact that fewer pulsars are observed in supernova remnants than expected from conventional scenarios @xcite . as regards dynamical simulations @xcite of the delayed collapse of hot neutron stars into black holes , baumgarte , shapiro and teukolsky@xcite have recently examined the effect of kaon condensates . here the cold eos is supplemented with simple assumptions about corrections for finite temperature . one - loop calculations to date are valid only up to the density at which the condensate forms where the condensate amplitude is vanishingly small . in order to go beyond threshold we analyze the fluctuations around the kaon condensate to one loop order and include the full non - linearities of the lagrangian . this is of general theoretical interest , as well as in the particular context of neutron stars . while we shall restrict our numerical analysis here to the zero - point contribution at zero temperature , the formalism also provides a consistent treatment of the thermal contributions due to kaons . these would be needed in studies of newborn neutron stars .    in the work which follows , we shall make the following approximations . nucleons are treated non - relativistically , whereas a more complete treatment would involve a relativistic treatment to one loop order . in the meson sector , we restrict the discussion to kaonic degrees of freedom . we thus omit from the discussion fluctuations in the pion and eta sectors . physically one might argue that ignoring non - kaonic pseudoscalar degrees of freedom is justified since one expects that the corresponding modes are less modified in nuclear matter than those of kaons . the methods developed here could be used to include the full octet of pseudoscalar fluctuations , but this would further complicate the present analysis . lastly , we have sought to treat the chiral lagrangian at the most simple level starting from the lagrangian of kaplan and nelson @xcite , although one would wish to include the additional terms of refs . @xcite at a later stage . the paper is organized as follows . in sec . ii , we present the basic formalism , including the evaluation of the kaon partition function , a discussion of divergences in the zero - point energy , the nucleon hamiltonian , and the equilibrium conditions . in sec . iii we compare numerical results in neutron star matter with and without zero - point fluctuations . we discuss the critical density for kaon condensation , the composition of the star and the eos . following the conclusions in sec . iv are three appendices . appendix a concerns the cancellation of divergences dependent on the chemical potential in a toy model , while appendix b discusses the case of the actual chiral lagrangian . in appendix c we derive the critical density from the kaon propagator to one - loop order , and show that it is the same as that obtained by expanding the zero - point energy in terms of the kaon fields . our principal interest is the evaluation of the impact of the kaon zero - point energy contribution on the structure of neutron stars . in subsec . a we obtain the partition function for the chiral lagrangian of kaplan and nelson @xcite to one loop order and in subsec . b we discuss the elimination of the divergences . for the nucleons alone we use a simple non - relativistic hamiltonian which should be sufficient for present purposes , as outlined in subsec . c. the stellar equilibrium conditions that need to be satisfied are given in subsec . d.      the @xmath11 chiral lagrangian involving the pseudoscalar meson octet and baryon octet is@xcite _ k & = & l^(1)+l^(2)+l^(0)_ct + l^(3)_ct+l^(4)_ct + l^(1 ) & = & i tr |b v b + itr|bv^[v_,b ] + 2 d tr |b s^\ { a _ , b } + 2 f tr    l^(2 ) & = & f^2 tr_u^u+ ctrm_q(u+u^-2 ) + a_1tr|b(m_q+h.c.)b + & & + a_2tr|bb(m_q+h.c . ) + a_3\{tr|bb } \{tr(m_qu+h.c . ) } + l^(c , d , f ) + l^(2)_ct . [ pje0 ] the bracketed superscripts denote the order in the low momentum expansion defining the effective field theory . the various one - loop counterterms , with subscripts _ ct _ , are discussed in appendices a and b ; here in the main text we will simply put them all together in a single @xmath12 . the additional terms denoted by @xmath13 are given in refs . @xcite and those with coefficients @xmath14 can contribute to @xmath15-wave kaon - nucleon interactions . in the interests of simplicity we set @xmath16 and so use as a starting point the lagrangian of kaplan and nelson@xcite . the lagrangian ( [ pje0 ] ) is derived in the limit of heavy baryons , where @xmath17 is the velocity four - vector of the baryons , and @xmath18 is the spin operator ( @xmath19,@xmath20 ) .    in eq . ( [ pje0 ] ) , @xmath21 is the non - linear field involving the pseudoscalar meson octet , from which we retain only the @xmath22 contributions @xmath23 and from the baryon octet we retain just the nucleon contributions @xmath24 consequently the @xmath25-wave interactions in @xmath26 with coefficients @xmath27 and @xmath28 do not enter ( @xmath29 ) . in eq . ( [ pje0 ] ) , the quark mass matrix @xmath30 ; _ i.e. _ , only the mass of the strange quark is taken to be non - zero . for the mesonic vector current , @xmath31 , only the time component survives in an infinite system with @xmath32 $ ] . also , the pion decay constant @xmath33 mev , and @xmath34 , and @xmath35 are constants . after some algebra , the relevant part of @xmath36 can be written _ k&=&(1+)_k^+^k^- + + & & + 2 + l_ct . [ lkaon ] here , the kaon mass is given by @xmath37 , and we have employed the following definitions : & & ^2=k^+k^-;=()^2;2=()^2 + & & b=(1+x);c=(a_1x+a_2 + 2a_3 ) . [ defs ] expectation values of nucleon operators are evaluated in the mean - field approximation . the total nucleon number density is @xmath38 and the proton fraction is @xmath39 . note that since we shall use a non - relativistic model for the nucleons we have not distinguished here between the scalar density and the number density in the expression for @xmath40 . the nucleon kinetic energy in @xmath26 will be considered in subsection c and so is not included in eq . ( [ lkaon ] ) . we have not included in eq . ( [ lkaon ] ) terms which simply give a constant shift to the baryon masses ; they indicate that @xmath41 mev and @xmath42 mev , using the hyperon - nucleon mass differences . the remaining constant @xmath43 is not accurately known , and we shall use values in the range @xmath44 to @xmath45 mev corresponding to 0 to 20% strangeness content for the proton . the corresponding range for the kaon - nucleon sigma term , @xmath46 is 167520 mev . some guidance is provided by recent lattice gauge simulations  @xcite , which find that the strange quark condensate in the nucleon is large , _ i.e. _ , @xmath47 . from the relation @xmath48 and using @xmath49 mev , we obtain @xmath50 mev , which is in the middle of our range of values .    in order to determine the kaon partition function we generalize the finite temperature procedure outlined by kapusta  @xcite and benson , bernstein and dodelson @xcite . first , by studying the invariance of the lagrangian under the transformation @xmath51 , the conserved current density can be identified . the zero component , _ i.e. _ the charge density , is @xmath52 next , we transform to real fields @xmath53 and @xmath54 , @xmath55 the lagrangian becomes _ k&=&a__1^_1 + b__2^_2+c__1^_2 + & & + 2+l_ct , [ lphi ] where a=;b=;c=. [ abc ] since , to our order of approximation , the counterterm lagrangian , @xmath12 , is to be evaluated with constant mean fields it plays no role in determining the conjugate momenta . these are _ 1&=&a_0_1+c_0_2 - 2 b_2 + _ 2&=&b_0_2+c_0_1 + 2 b_1 . the hamiltonian density is @xmath56 , and the partition function of the grand canonical ensemble can then be written as the functional integral @xmath57[d\pi_2]\int_{periodic}[d\phi_1][d\phi_2]\nonumber\\ & & \quad\times\exp\left\{\int\limits_0^{\beta}d\tau\int d^3x\left ( i\pi_1\frac{\partial\phi_1}{\partial\tau}+ i\pi_2\frac{\partial\phi_2}{\partial\tau}-{\cal h}_k(\phi_i,\pi_i ) + \mu j_0(\phi_i,\pi_i)\right)\right\}\;.\label{zint}\end{aligned}\ ] ] here @xmath0 is the chemical potential associated with the conserved charge density , @xmath58 is the inverse temperature and the fields obey periodic boundary conditions in the imaginary time @xmath59 , namely @xmath60 . the gaussian integral over momenta in eq . ( [ zint ] ) can be performed yielding z_k&=&n^e^-s + s&=&_0^dd^3x\ { a()^2 + b()^2 + 2c + & & + a(_1)^2+b(_2)^2 + 2c_1_2 + 2i(+2 b)_2_1 + & & + ( _ 1 ^ 2+_2 ^ 2)-2l_ct}. [ action ] the dependence of the action ( [ action ] ) upon the chemical potential @xmath0 can also be obtained by gauging the fields as discussed in appendices a and b.    next the fields are decomposed into constant condensate parts and fluctuations according to @xmath61 here @xmath62 denotes the volume of the system . in the fourier expansion of the fluctuating part @xmath63 and the matsubara frequency @xmath64 . since we wish to go to one loop order , @xmath12 is evaluated with constant condensate fields and we write the contribution as a potential @xmath65 . the remainder of @xmath66 must be expanded to second order in the fluctuations . the partition function can then be written in the form z_k = ne^-v(v_tree+v_ct)_n , [ d_1,n ( ) ] [ d_2,n ( ) ] ^e^-s_loop . [ zone ] introducing the definitions & & ( ) = 2 ( m_k^2 + c - 2 b ) f^2 ^2- ^2 f^2 ^2 + & & ( ) = - = 4 b f^2 ^2 + f^2 ^2 , the tree potential is v_tree= ( ) . [ vtree ] the one loop contribution to the action then becomes s_loop&=&_n,(_1,-n(- ) , _ 2,-n(- ) ) ( ) , + ^-2f^2 d_11 & = & af^2 ( _ n^2 + * p*^2 ) - _ n ( ) 2 +  ^2+ + ^-2f^2 d_22 & = & bf^2 ( _ n^2 + * p*^2 ) + _ n ( ) 2 +  ^2 +  + ^-2f^2 d_12 & = & cf^2 ( _ n^2 + * p*^2 ) + 2 _ n ( + ^2 ( )  ) + (  -  ) + ^-2f^2 d_21 & = & cf^2 ( _ n^2 + * p*^2 ) -2 _ n ( + ^2 ( )  ) + (  -  ) , [ dmatrix ] with a prime denoting a partial derivative with respect to @xmath67 . here the quantities @xmath68 and @xmath69 of eq . ( [ abc ] ) are to be evaluated with the condensate fields , giving a=1+(-1)^2;b=1+(-1)^2;c=(1- ) , and @xmath70 . the latter replacement should also be made in the measure of the integral ( [ zone ] ) , to the order considered . then the integration can be carried out and the grand potential @xmath71 is given by = -z_k = v_tree+v_ct + _ n , . [ grand1 ] evaluating the determinant yields & = & ^4 + & & ^2 ( _ n^2 + e_+^2 ) ^2 ( _ n^2 + e_-^2 ) , [ detd ] where & & c_1 = ( ) , c_2 = , c_3 = [ cs ] + & & e_^2 ( ) = p^2 + c_1 + c_2 + c_3 . [ disp ] notice that there is no longer any dependence on the condensate phase @xmath72 . the sum over the matsubara frequencies in eq . ( [ grand1 ] ) can then be evaluated in the usual way @xcite to yield & & _ k ^-1=v_tree+v_ct+v_zp+v_thermal + & & v_zp = [ vzp ] + & & v_thermal = ^-1 ( 1 - e^-e_+())(1 - e^-e_- ( ) ) . [ vthermal ] we are interested in zero temperature here , so @xmath73 may be dropped .    the zero - point energy @xmath74 , or equivalently , the one - kaon - loop contribution to the effective potential@xcite , can be represented as an infinite series of diagrams , some of which are shown in fig . vertices are given by the lagrangian ( [ lkaon ] ) . external legs represent nucleon or kaon mean fields . it is interesting to note the chiral order of the diagrams contributing to the effective potential . consider the _ scattering amplitudes _ corresponding to the diagrams of fig . 1 , where the external lines are on their respective vacuum mass - shells . the chiral order , @xmath75 , of a given scattering amplitude is given by the weinberg@xcite counting rule , according to which an amplitude involving @xmath76 external nucleon lines and @xmath77 external kaon lines is proportional to @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is a characteristic small momentum scale involved in the process and = 2 + 2l - e_n + _ i ( d_i + n_i -2 ) , [ count ] where @xmath80 is the number of loops , the sum is over all vertices @xmath81 , @xmath82 the number of derivatives that act on the @xmath81th vertex and @xmath83 the number of nucleon lines attached to the @xmath81th vertex . in this case 1a gives @xmath84 . furthermore , it easy to convince oneself that adding a vertex from @xmath26 , corresponding to the @xmath85 term in eq . ( [ lkaon ] ) , will decrease @xmath75 by 1 . on the other hand , adding a vertex from @xmath86 , corresponding to the kinetic , mass , or @xmath40 terms in eq . ( [ lkaon ] ) leaves @xmath75 invariant . the fact that these scattering amplitudes give @xmath87 due to the @xmath26 interaction might appear to be grounds for concern . however , exactly the same apparent counting problem arises when one considers the computation of the tree - level in - medium kaon propagator . the correct in - medium propagator is indeed obtained by summing an infinite series@xcite in diagrams that here correspond to amplitudes with decreasing powers of @xmath75 . the evaluation of the effective potential is entirely analogous . we conclude that while eq . ( [ count ] ) provides an effective way to organize terms in order of importance for a given scattering process , it can not be naively applied in the same way to the effective potential in the case at hand .      as shown in appendices a and b , @xmath65 cancels the ultraviolet divergences in @xmath74 . for our purposes the zero - point energy is most conveniently written v_zp = ( ^2 + c_1 + c_2 + c_3 + ) ^12 . [ zpdiv ] we regularize the infinities that occur here by introducing an ultraviolet cutoff @xmath88 and requiring @xmath89 . ( dimensional regularization is discussed in appendix b. ) the counterterm potential @xmath65 following from @xmath12 ( see appendix b ) is v_ct = - ( d_4+f_4 ) - ( c_1 + 2 c_2 + 2 c_3 ) ( d_2+f_2 ) + ( d_0+f_0 ) . [ ct ] here we have introduced finite terms @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 as well as the quartically , quadratically and logarithmically divergent integrals d_4 & = & _ k k = [ quartdiv ] + d_2 & = & _ k = [ quaddiv ] + d_0 & = & _ k = ( ) . [ logdiv ] here @xmath93 is an arbitrary scale introduced so that the argument of the logarithm is dimensionless . note that the quadratically and logarithmically divergent pieces of @xmath74 in ( [ zpdiv ] ) and @xmath65 in ( [ ct ] ) are individually dependent upon the chemical potential @xmath0 . this dependency on the chemical potential @xmath0 arises from the functions of the kaon fields multiplying the kinetic terms in eq . ( [ lkaon ] ) . however , @xmath0-dependent divergences in the terms @xmath74 and @xmath65 cancel , as do the @xmath0-independent divergences of the vacuum theory . the cancellation of @xmath0-dependent divergences follows from a careful treatment of the counterterm lagrangian which regulates the vacuum theory . further discussion of this point is given in appendices a and b. here we note that @xmath0 may be considered a constant external vector potential @xmath94 , with vanishing spatial components . the general statement being made is that all green functions with constant external @xmath94 fields are finite . it is easy to check this for simple examples related to our theory , such as scalar electrodynamics . the fact that it also holds for a complicated nonlinear theory expanded about an arbitrary point @xmath53 , @xmath54 in function space is almost certainly a consequence of the ward - takahashi identities associated with the u(1 ) symmetry transformation preceding eq . ( 7 ) .    in order to determine the finite contributions @xmath95 we apply three conditions in the vacuum . first @xmath71 , or equivalently the pressure , should be zero in the vacuum and , since there is no condensate , the loop contribution must vanish . secondly , we require the zero - momentum propagator to be of the usual form @xmath96 , see appendix c. thirdly we require that the four - point vertex @xmath97 of eq . ( c3 ) be unmodified in vacuum . these conditions imply & & v_zp+v_ct|_vacuum=0 + & & ( v_zp+v_ct)|_vacuum=0 + & & ( v_zp+v_ct)|_vacuum=0 . expanding to fourth order in @xmath67 , one finds & & f_4=;f_2=- + & & f_0=(+- ) , where using our three momentum cutoff , the constant @xmath98 ; interestingly a closely similar value for the constant is obtained with dimensional regularization , namely @xmath99 ( here @xmath100 represents the digamma function @xcite ) . notice that the arbitary scale @xmath93 only occurs in the combination @xmath101 where it cancels out . the disappearance of the arbitary scale is one justification for introducing the finite counterterms , we discuss another below .    in evaluating the grand potential for the general case numerical integration of eq . ( [ zpdiv ] ) for @xmath74 is required . however below threshold when @xmath102 ( or just at threshold when @xmath67 is vanishingly small ) the expressions simplify greatly and an analytic form can be obtained . explicitly we find @xmath103 , @xmath104 , and eigenvalues e _ = ( b+ ) ^2=b^2 + m_k^2 + c  = 0 . [ epm ] notice that @xmath105 is simply the tree level energy of a @xmath22 meson . in this limit the one loop energy becomes v_zp + v_ct & = & - ( d_4+f_4 ) - ^2(d_2+f_2 ) + ^4 ( d_0+f_0 ) + & = & -  = 0 , [ vzp0 ] which vanishes in the vacuum since @xmath106 there .      to describe the nuclear kinetic energy and interactions we employ the non - relativistic approach suggested by prakash , ainsworth and lattimer @xcite , which has been rather widely employed , _ e.g. _ refs . @xcite . here the hamiltonian density is written _ n= e_f^0 u^n_0 + v(u ) + n(1 - 2x)^2s(u ) , [ hnuc ] where nuclear saturation density is denoted by @xmath107 ( @xmath108 ) and the corresponding fermi momentum and energy are @xmath109 and @xmath110 , respectively . the potential contribution to the energy density of symmetric nuclear matter is denoted by @xmath111 , where @xmath112 and it is given by v(u)= au^2n_0 + + 3un_0_i=1,2c_i()^3 ( - ) . here @xmath113 is the fermi momentum which is related to @xmath114 by @xmath115 . the remaining quantities are parameters which are given in refs . we choose the set which yields a compression modulus @xmath116 mev for equilibrium nuclear matter since this is in the middle of the generally accepted range of @xmath117 mev . the remaining term in eq . ( [ hnuc ] ) is the symmetry energy , _ i.e. _ it describes the change in the energy density when the proton fraction @xmath39 differs from @xmath118 . again following ref . @xcite we take s(u)=(2 ^ -1 ) e_f^0(u^-f(u))+s_0f(u ) , where @xmath119 mev is the bulk symmetry energy parameter . since neutron star properties are not strongly dependent on the form of @xmath120 , we choose the simplest of the suggested parametrizations namely @xmath121 .    in terms of the hamiltonian density , the grand potential for nucleons is = h_n-_n n + xn , where @xmath122 and the chemical potential @xmath123 is the fermi energy for neutrons . we shall study cold , catalyzed neutron stars which are in chemical equilibrium under beta decay processes . the process @xmath124 in equilibrium establishes the relation _ n-_p = _ e , [ beta ] since the neutrinos have left the star and their chemical potential is therefore zero . at densities where @xmath0 exceeds the muon mass @xmath125 , muons can be formed by @xmath126 , hence the muon chemical potential is @xmath127 . negatively charged kaons can be formed in the process @xmath128 when @xmath129 becomes equal to the energy of the lowest eigenstate of a @xmath1 in matter . chemical equilibrium requires that @xmath130 , as we have implicitly assumed in the text .    to complete our grand potential we need the lepton component for which it is sufficient to use the standard non - interacting form : = -+(||-m_)\ { - } , where @xmath131 is the heaviside function ( @xmath132 if @xmath133 , @xmath134 if @xmath135 ) and the quantity @xmath136 . the total grand potential is then _ total = _ k + _ the values of the chemical potential @xmath0 , the proton fraction @xmath137 and the condensate amplitude @xmath67 are determined by extremizing @xmath138 . extremizing with respect to @xmath0 is equivalent to the requirement of charge neutrality . it yields 0=-n_k+n_p - n_l [ mumin ] , where @xmath139 and @xmath140 are the number densities for negatively charged kaons and leptons respectively . the kaon charge density is n_k = f^2(4b^2+^2 ) - . [ nk ] notice that the fluctuations carry no net charge in the absence of a condensate , _ i.e. _ @xmath141 for @xmath102 . here , and in the other cases , the zero point contribution requires a numerical integration and it is straightforward , though tedious , to evaluate the integrand . the lepton charge density is n_l=+ ( ||-m _ ) . next extremizing with respect to @xmath137 gives 0=n(2a_1m_s-)^2 + + n-4n(1 - 2x)s(u ) [ xmin ] . finally extremizing with respect to @xmath67 yields 0=f^2(m_k^2+c-2b-^2 ) + [ thmin ] . below the threshold for kaon condensation @xmath102 and this solution is always possible since the expression is an odd function of @xmath67 . above threshold the solution @xmath142 minimizes the grand potential . at threshold , where @xmath67 is vanishingly small , it is possible to obtain an analytic expression by retaining terms through order @xmath143 in @xmath71 . the extremization condition becomes    [ uc ] 0&= & ( m_k^2+c)(1+)-2b(1 - 2)-^2(1 + ) [ uca ] & = & ( ^2-m_k^2+^2 ) . [ ucb ]    this may alternatively be obtained by computing the inverse propagator , @xmath144 , to one loop order , see appendix c. notice that , by construction , the inverse propagator is @xmath145 in vacuum since @xmath146 there . in fact for any density @xmath147 . that this is necessary may be seen as follows . the arguments of the inner square root in eq . ( [ zpdiv ] ) is positive for all @xmath148 , only if @xmath149 _ or _ both @xmath150 and @xmath151 if @xmath152 . however in our calculations we have found that going even slightly above threshold implies @xmath153 , so that it is the latter condition that must be satisfied . now the above equation ( [ uca ] ) can be put in the form @xmath154 . since @xmath155 ( sec.iii ) , and @xmath85 and @xmath0 are positive , we must have @xmath156 . it is interesting to note that in the absence of finite counterterms the requirement @xmath156 can only be achieved in a very limited region of parameter space . having satisfied the conditions ( [ mumin ] ) , ( [ xmin ] ) and ( [ thmin ] ) , the energy density can be obtained from = + _ n n . the chemical potential @xmath123 may be obtained by functional differentiation of the energy density with respect to the neutron density , _ viz . _ @xmath157 , whence the pressure can be calculated from @xmath158 . equivalently one can write @xmath159 . in this section , we give numerical estimates for the effect of the loop corrections upon the critical density for kaon condensation and upon the properties of neutron star matter both above and below the condensate threshold . as follows from eqs . ( [ uc ] ) and ( c1 ) , the critical density for kaon condensation is the density at which the lepton chemical potential @xmath0 ( an increasing function of density ) , and the position of the zero - momentum @xmath1 pole of the kaon propagator in normal nuclear matter ( a decreasing function of density ) become equal . the chemical potential @xmath0 and the proton fraction @xmath137 , prior to condensation , are obtained from eqs . ( [ mumin ] ) and ( [ xmin ] ) by setting @xmath102 . the pole position of the kaon propagator is a solution to the quadratic equation @xmath160 , where @xmath161 is given in eq . ( c4 ) .    in table i , we list the critical density for kaon condensation in units of nuclear matter density , @xmath162 , for three representative values of the parameter @xmath43 . in column 2 , @xmath163 is the critical density obtained at tree level@xcite , corresponding to setting @xmath164 in eq . ( [ uc ] ) and omitting the @xmath165 contributions from eqs . ( [ mumin ] ) and ( [ xmin ] ) . in column 3 , the loop contribution is included and the corresponding critical density is denoted by @xmath166 . we see that @xmath167 and , while the magnitude of the threshold shift increases for larger values of @xmath168 , it is always small . this due to the fact that in eq . ( [ uc ] ) @xmath169 which is small in comparison to unity . it is rather easy to show that @xmath167 . the tree level inverse propagator @xmath170 at threshold , while with loops included one has @xmath171 . since @xmath172 is a monotonic function of density and we have pointed out that @xmath156 , it follows that @xmath167 .    the change in the threshold due to loops , small though it is , is dominated by the @xmath173 term this is shown in column 4 of table i for which we set @xmath174 in the loop expressions . in this case the threshold is essentially unchanged from tree level . the effect of the @xmath40 term can become quite critical at densities above threshold and in eq . ( [ defs ] ) the scalar density @xmath175 has been replaced by the baryon density @xmath176 . in ref.@xcite it was argued that in the heavy baryon limit , and to the chiral order considered , no distinction should be made between the operators @xmath177 and @xmath178 in the lagrangian ( [ pje0 ] ) . corrections to this would , in principle , require other effects of similar order for consistency . while @xmath179 for @xmath180 , at high density @xmath181 becomes less than @xmath182 . the results of ref . @xcite indicate that this can be significant , in particular it leads to an increase in @xmath183 . since our results are sensitive to this question , in some of our calculations we shall replace the baryon density @xmath182 in the quantity @xmath40 of eq . ( [ defs ] ) by a phenomenological form of @xmath181 . based on a simple parameterization of the effective nucleon mass obtained by serot and walecka@xcite , we use n_s = n ( 1 - ) [ ns ] for @xmath184 and set @xmath185 for @xmath186 . this is extremely crude , but it will give some qualitative feel for the effect . the results for the critical density with this approach , labelled @xmath187 , are shown in columns 5 and 6 of table i. the shift in the critical density between tree and tree + loop levels is slightly smaller , but basically similar to that obtained before . the overall increase in the critical density is expected , but is somewhat larger than models which treat nucleons relativistically @xcite would suggest .    even below threshold there is a kaon zero - point contribution for normal neutron star matter . firstly there is a shift in the minimum due to the zero point contribution to the equilibrium eq . ( [ xmin ] ) at @xmath102 . secondly there is the zero point energy ( [ vzp0 ] ) itself . the shift in the proton fraction @xmath137 and the lepton chemical potential @xmath0 is negligible . table ii shows that @xmath188 , the zero - point energy density is approximately 13% of the total . thus the matter properties are only affected to a small degree so that it is not necessary to refit the parameters of the nuclear hamiltonian . above the critical density the properties of matter are obtained by solving eqs . ( [ mumin ] ) , ( [ xmin ] ) , and ( [ thmin ] ) numerically . in practice , one uses a three - momentum cutoff @xmath88 to evaluate eq . ( [ zpdiv ] ) and derivatives thereof . the cutoff used was @xmath189 mev / c , and results were found to be extremely stable with respect to variation in @xmath88 . for example taking @xmath190 mev / c , the largest change in any of the tabulated values was 0.3% .    in table iii , we list the properties of normal neutron star matter ( column 2 ) and matter containing a kaon condensate at tree level ( columns 37 ) and at one - loop level ( columns 813 ) for @xmath191 mev . here the kaon fraction is defined as @xmath192 in terms of the kaon density @xmath139 of eq . ( [ nk ] ) , and the lepton fraction @xmath193 may be obtained from @xmath194 . the energy density is also listed . we have not felt it worthwhile to tabulate the remaining thermodynamic variable , the pressure , in view of the small size of the loop effects . for @xmath195 the parameter @xmath196 becomes negative which precludes real solutions to the zero point energies ; we discuss this further below . in table iv , we give the corresponding quantities for @xmath197 mev , in which case @xmath196 becomes negative for @xmath198 . this difficulty does not arise if we employ the phenomenological scaling given by eq . ( [ ns ] ) and the results are given for @xmath197 mev in table v. if one simply sets @xmath174 in the loop calculations the results shown in fig . 2 are obtained . in this figure @xmath199 represents the energy density gained by the formation of a condensate and is the difference between the total energy density and the tree level energy density for normal nuclear matter . we first note that loop effects for the case @xmath191 mev are essentially negligible . although they increase in magnitude for larger values of @xmath168 , only small modifications of the tree level results are found . table iv shows that just above threshold the tree + loop calculation gives values of @xmath67 and @xmath137 which are greater than , and @xmath0 which are less than , the corresponding tree level results . this naturally follows from the fact that @xmath166 is less than @xmath200 since , once a condensate is present , @xmath67 rises rapidly and @xmath137 is enhanced , while @xmath0 is reduced at high densities , this ordering is reversed . near the limiting density , @xmath201 , @xmath67 typically decreases by @xmath202% while @xmath137 decreases somewhat less , @xmath203% , and @xmath0 increases @xmath204% . the zero - point energy density is of the order @xmath205 and can decrease the tree level result significantly at high density when the latter can be small . for a given density the effects are smaller if the scalar density of eq . ( [ ns ] ) is employed as shown in table v. on the other hand , setting @xmath174 altogether as in fig . 2 yields larger effects at very high density . for @xmath206 mev , the above trends are also present , and are enhanced , as expected . the coefficient @xmath196 goes to zero for @xmath207 , at which point @xmath208 and @xmath209 .    as mentioned above , @xmath196 often vanishes at some density above the critical density . the condition @xmath210 implies @xmath211 , where @xmath212 is the tree level energy density function of eq . ( [ vtree ] ) . the significance of this condition is best illustrated by the simple @xmath213 invariant lagrangian @xmath214 , where @xmath215 . the one - loop effective potential@xcite is @xmath216 , where the trace is over momentum . now take @xmath217 , with @xmath218 . for @xmath219 , @xmath220 is real for all @xmath7 . on the other hand , for @xmath221 , the `` mexican hat '' potential , the one - loop effective potential is complex in the region @xmath222 which signals a physical instability . weinberg and wu @xcite show that the imaginary part can be interpreted as a decay rate per unit volume of a well - defined state . the connection between the instability and the chaotic dynamics of a classical field theory has recently been discussed by matinyan and mller @xcite , see also references therein .    unfortunately no solution is known to this general problem . our case is entirely analogous . at threshold @xmath223 corresponds to @xmath219 . as the density is increased , the tree level potential eventually corresponds to @xmath221 . this effect is more pronounced for larger values of @xmath168 . since the effective potential is by definition real , this shows that some , as yet unknown , technique is needed in these regions of parameter space . the two other cases we have considered , excluding @xmath40 from the loop contribution and employing the softer density dependence of @xmath40 with the parametrized scalar density @xmath181 alleviate this problem . we have derived the zero - point energy due to fluctuations in kaonic modes in neutron star matter containing a kaon condensate . to our knowledge , this calculation is the first in which the nonlinearities of the chiral lagrangian have been taken into account at the one loop level for densities _ above _ the critical density for kaon condensation . the zero - point energy was derived through the thermodynamic partition function by considering fluctuations around an arbitrary condensate . we have demonstrated by gauging the counterterms of the vacuum theory that no divergences are present when matter is introduced via the charge chemical potential . in the usual way the total thermodynamic potential , including the classical contribution , is extremized so that the minimum energy ground state is found for locally charge neutral and beta - equilibrated matter . the critical density for kaon condensation was found to be reduced by fluctuations , but only by less than 1% for the range of parameters considered . at higher densities the loop effects were negligible for @xmath191 mev which corresponds to zero strangeness content for the nucleon . the effects were slightly increased with larger values of @xmath168 , corresponding to larger value of the kaon nucleon sigma term @xmath173 , but they remained small in comparison to the dominant tree level contributions . the size of the loop effects relative to the tree contributions is set , at least in the threshold region , by the parameter @xmath224 which is less than @xmath225 . in some cases it was not possible to obtain solutions up to arbitrary density because the effective potential became complex this is a well - known and unsolved problem in one loop calculations with spontaneous symmetry breaking . the fact that changes induced by the zero - point motion are generally small leads one first to conclude that no major revision is needed of earlier investigations in which such fluctuations have not been taken into account . second , the loop expansion appears to be convergent where it is well defined . the formalism presented here yielded the contribution to the grand potential arising from thermal excitations of the fluctuation modes . these effects would have to be included at finite temperatures and would be involved in the extremization conditions . such an analysis is needed for a consistent study of newborn neutron stars . extension of the present work to include the full octet of pseudoscalar fluctuations , and to include additional terms in the chiral expansion could also be contemplated . we wish to thank p. b. arnold , a. fayyazuddin , u. van kolck , and l. yaffe for helpful discussions , and d. b. kaplan , m. rho , r. venugopalan and a. wirzba for valuable comments on the manuscript . we are grateful to m. prakash for stimulating our interest in this problem and for careful reading of the manuscript . this work was supported in part by the u. s. department of energy under grant de - fg06 - 88er40427 . in this appendix , we illustrate how divergences dependent on the charge chemical potential @xmath0 are cancelled in a toy model which contains two real fields , @xmath53and @xmath54 . the model we consider is = l_+ l_ct _ = , [ gtoytree ] and @xmath226 is an arbitrary analytic function of @xmath227 with @xmath228 . it is useful to discuss this model to one loop order since it has a simpler structure than the chiral lagrangian , but the @xmath0-dependent divergences are removed in a similar way . we first derive @xmath12 , and then demonstrate that on introducing an external chemical potential @xmath0 , the effective potential ( or equivalently , the zero - point energy ) is free of divergences . finite counterterms are not relevant in the present context and will be ignored .    expanding the function @xmath226 to all orders in the fields gives the the standard kinetic energy term plus an infinite set of interaction terms involving an even number of fields and two derivatives . from these interaction vertices , we may compute one - particle irreducible @xmath229-point green functions to one - loop order . the counterterm lagrangian @xmath12 is defined in such a way as to minimally cancel divergences . consider first quadratic divergences , proportional to @xmath230 ( defined in eq . ( [ quaddiv ] ) ) . the 4-point vertex contributes a quadratic divergence to the 2-point function proportional to @xmath230 and the external momenta . the corresponding counterterm lagrangian is proportional to @xmath231 $ ] . the 6-point vertex contributes to the 4-point function so as to require a counterterm lagrangian proportional to @xmath232 $ ] . continuing this sequence , we find that the contribution of quadratic divergences to the counterterm lagrangian is @xmath233 $ ] , where primes denote derivatives with respect to @xmath7 .    now consider logarithmic divergences , proportional to @xmath234 ( see eq . ( [ logdiv ] ) ) . green functions containing such divergences typically contain two vertices , and evaluating them requires involved combinatorics . it is simpler instead to derive the counterterm lagrangian using the effective potential ( see e.g. ref.@xcite ) . one thus avoids combinatorics , and the method is more easily applied to lagrangians more complicated than eq . ( [ gtoytree ] ) . let _ 1 _ 1 + _ 1 , _ 2 _ 2 + _ 2 , [ phiexpand ] where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are arbitrary fields which , for the present , may vary in spacetime . expanding to quadratic order in the fields @xmath235 and @xmath236 leads to _ _ + (    cc _ 1 & _ 2    ) d (    c _ 1 + _ 2    ) , where the matrix of second order variations is given by d & = & - + l - m , + l_&= & 2 (    cc _ 1 _ _ 1 & _ 1 _ _ 2 + _ 2 _ _ 1 & _ 2 _ _ 2    ) , + m & = & - (    cc _ 1 ^ 2 + _ 2 ^ 2 & _ 1 _ 2 (  - ) + _ 1 _ 2 (  - ) & _ 2 ^ 2  + _ 1 ^ 2    ) . integrating out the fields @xmath235 and @xmath236 gives the unrenormalized effective potential to one - loop order - d & = & - i -i ( - ) + & & + _ k=1^ ( [ l - l + 2 m + ( l ) ] ) ^k , [ effpotgamma ] where , as before , the trace is taken both over spacetime and charge . the factor @xmath237 is cancelled by a corresponding contribution from the measure , and will not be considered further . in the last expression , we have symmetrized the derivative contribution and separated the mass - like contributions involving @xmath238 $ ] . we shall see that only the mass - like contributions are important for our discussion . the trace over spacetime is evaluated by inserting complete sets of four - momentum eigenstates . a momentum expansion is performed on the resulting integrals , leading to a factorization into ultraviolet divergent loop integrals and integrals over functions of the fields . to minimally cancel the divergences in the effective potential we need the following counterterm lagrangian _ ct = l_ct^quartic + l_ct^mass - like + l_ct^derivative , where the contribution from the quartic divergence ( [ quartdiv ] ) is d^4x_ct^quartic = -i ( - ) = d^4x d_4 [ toyquart ] . the contribution from mass - like terms is d^4x _ ct^mass - like & = & _ k=1 ^ 2 ( [ 2 m + ( l ) ] ) ^k + & = & d^4x - d^4x [ 2 m + ( l)]^2 + & = & - d^4x \ { (  + ) -^2 } + & & - d^4x \{^2 + & & - + & & + ( ) ^2 } . [ masslike ] for the contribution from derivatives one finds ( see also refs . @xcite ) d^4x _ ct^derivative & = & _ k=2 ^ 4 ( ( l - l ) ) ^k + & = & - d^4x \ { ( _ l_- _ l_)^2 - ( _ l_- _ l _ ) [ l _ , l _ ] + & & + l_^2 l_^2 + ( l_l_)^2 } - d^4x l_^2 . [ dervs ] this concludes the derivation of @xmath12 , to one - loop order .    having derived a one - loop finite vacuum theory , we are now in a position to study the theory in the presence of a finite chemical potential @xmath0 , at finite inverse temperature @xmath239 . as before , the euclidean time is @xmath240 , and the action @xmath241 under the transformation to euclidean space . the chemical potential acts as an external vector field with spatial components zero . it enters by `` gauging '' the fields @xmath53 and @xmath54 via the transformation i i - _ 2 ; i i + _ 1 . [ imtrans ] the resulting action is given by s & = & s_+ s_ct ,  where [ sgammamu ] + s_&= & _ 0^dd^3x _ , s_ct = _ 0^dd^3x _ ct + l_ct & = & - d_4 - \ { (  + ) l_+ } + \ { ( l_)^2 + } , [ toylct ] + l _ & = & ( _ _ 1 ) ^2 + ( _ _ 2 ) ^2 + ( _ 1 ) ^2 + ( _ 2 ) ^2 + 2 i ( _ 2 _ _ 1 - _ 1 _ _ 2 ) - ^2 ^2 . ( [ dervs ] ) is invariant under the transformation ( [ imtrans ] ) and is therefore not included above . we have now derived the action to one - loop order , for arbitrary fields @xmath53 and @xmath54 in the presence of a chemical potential @xmath0 . we then take the final step , and evaluate the one - loop effective potential for fields @xmath53 and @xmath54 which are _ constant _ in spacetime ( see eq . ( [ decomp ] ) ) so that their derivatives vanish . expanding eq . ( [ sgammamu ] ) to quadratic order in the fields and integrating out the fluctuating field gives the action s & = & s_tree + s_loop + s_ct , + s_tree & = & - _ 0^dd^3x ^2 ^2 , + s_loop & = & - d , [ sloop ] where the matrix of second order variations about the constant fields , @xmath27 , is given by d_11 & = & ( _ n^2 + * p*^2 ) - 2 _ n _ 1 _ 2 - ^2 - ^2 ( _ 2 ^ 2 + 4 _ 1 ^ 2 ) - ^2 _ 1 ^ 2 + d_22 & = & ( _ n^2 + * p*^2 ) + 2 _ n _ 1 _ 2 - ^2 - ^2 ( _ 1 ^ 2 + 4 _ 2 ^ 2 ) - ^2 _ 2 ^ 2 + d_12 & = & 2 _ n ( + _ 1 ^ 2 ) - ^2 _ 1 _ 2 (  + 3 ) + d_21 & = & - 2 _ n ( + _ 2 ^ 2 ) - ^2 _ 1 _ 2 (  + 3 ) , and @xmath242 is the matsubara frequency . the determinant is given by eq . ( [ detd ] ) , with an additional factor of @xmath243 on the left , and with c_1 = ( +  )  ,   c_2 = - ( 2 + 4 + ^2  )  ,   c_3 = - ( 2 +  ) . as before , it is convenient to factorize the determinant , leading to dispersion relations for two modes given by eq . ( [ disp ] ) . ( [ sloop ] ) then separates into a zero - point and a thermal contribution s_loop = _ 0^dd^3x ( v_zp + v_thermal ) , with @xmath74 and @xmath73 given by eqs . ( [ vzp ] ) and ( [ vthermal ] ) respectively . the counterterm action obtained from eqs . ( [ toyquart ] ) , ( [ masslike ] ) and ( [ dervs ] ) after gauging and setting @xmath244 to be constant can be written s_ct = _ 0^dd^3x v_ct , where @xmath65 is given by the divergent parts of eq . ( [ ct ] ) , _ i.e. _ the terms involving @xmath234 , @xmath230 and @xmath245 . as noted in sec . iib , the @xmath0 dependent divergences in @xmath74 are exactly cancelled by those in @xmath65 . in this appendix , we give details of the cancellation of quadratic divergences dependent on the chemical potential @xmath0 for the chiral lagrangian , eq . ( [ lphi ] ) . ( the cancellation of quartic divergences needs no discussion since it is straightforward . ) we follow the procedure given in appendix a. it is first convenient to break the lagrangian down as follows : _ k & = & l_h+ l_v + l_u + l_ct + l_h & = & a ( _ _ 1)^2 + b ( _ _ 2)^2 + c _ _ 1 _ _ 2 + l_v & = & b _ 12 ( _ 1_2 ) + l_u & = & - 2 f^2 ( m_k^2+c ) ^2- u ( ) . note that in addition to having more terms than the toy model of appendix a , the kinetic term , @xmath246 , is nondiagonal here .    expanding as in eq . ( [ phiexpand ] ) , the matrix @xmath27 of second order variations of the fields @xmath247 is given by d = -t + l - m ; t = (    cc a & c + c & b    ) . the matrix @xmath80 can be written l^&= & l_h_1^+ l_h_2^+ l_v_1^+ l_v_2^ + l_h_1^&= & 2 (    cc _ 1 ^_1 & _ 1 ^_2 + _ 2 ^_1 & _ 2 ^_2    ) ; l_h_2^= - 2 (    cc _ 1 ^_1 & _ 1 ^_2 + _ 2 ^_1 & _ 2 ^_2    ) + l_v_1^&= & ^0 2 b _ 12 (    cc 0 & 1 + -1 & 0    ) ; l_v_2^= ^0 2 b (    cc - _ 1 _ 2 & _ 1 ^ 2 + - _ 2 ^ 2 & _ 1 _ 2    ) . [ lterms ] the matrix @xmath248 takes the form m & = & m_h_1 + m_h_2 + m_v_1 + m_v_2 + m_u + m_h_1 & = & - (    cc _ 1 ^ 2  + _ 2 ^ 2 & _ 1 _ 2 (  - ) + _ 1 _ 2 (  - ) & _ 2 ^ 2  + _ 1 ^ 2    ) + m_h_2 & = & (    cc _ 1 _ 1 & _ 1 _ 2 + _ 2 _ 1 & _ 2 _ 2    ) + m_v_1 & = & 2 b (    cc - _ 1 ^0 _ 2 & - _ 2 ^0 _ 2 + _ 1 ^0 _ 1 & _ 2 ^0 _ 1    ) + m_v_2 & = & - b ( _ 1_2 ) (    cc _ 1 ^ 2 _ 12  + _ 12 & _ 1 _ 2 ( _ 12  - _ 12 ) + _ 1 _ 2 ( _ 12  - _ 12 ) & _ 2 ^ 2 _ 12  + _ 12    ) + m_u & = & (    cc _ 1 ^ 2 u  + _ 2 ^ 2 & _ 1 _ 2 ( u  - ) + _ 1 _ 2 ( u  - ) & _ 2 ^ 2 u  + _ 1 ^ 2    ) . [ mterms ] as in appendix a primes denote derivatives with respect to @xmath7 . it may be checked that by gauging @xmath27 according to eq . ( [ imtrans ] ) and then taking the fields @xmath244 to be constant , one recovers eq . ( [ dmatrix ] ) . it is now straightforward , but tedious , to compute the the quadratically divergent contributions to the counterterm lagrangian by evaluating the terms of the form ( t^-1 m ) - ( t^-1 l^)^2 . omitting terms that are invariant under the transformation ( [ imtrans ] ) , we find the following contributions to @xmath249 : ( t^-1 m_h_1 ) & = & - (  + ) [ mh1 ] + ( t^-1 m_h_2 ) & = & ( _ 1 _ 1 + _ 2 _ 2 ) [ mh2 ] + ( t^-1 m_v_1 ) & = & - b ( _ 1_2 ) [ mv1 ] + ( t^-1 m_v_2 ) & = & - b ( _ 12  + ) ( _ 1_2 ) [ mv2 ] + ( t^-1 m_u ) & = & ( + u  ) [ mu ] + - ( t^-1 l_v^)^2 & = & b^2 ( _ 12 + _ 12 ) [ lv ] + - ( t^-1 [ l_h_1^+ l_h_2^ ] ) ^2 & = & - ( - ) ^2 ( _ 1 ^_1 + _ 2 ^_2 ) ^2 [ lhsq ] + - ( t^-1 l_v^t^-1 [ l_h_1^+ l_h_2^ ] ) & = & b ( - ) ( _ 1_2 ) [ lvlh ] . following appendix a , we use the transformation ( [ imtrans ] ) on @xmath12 and find that the quadratically divergent contribution to @xmath65 is v_ct^quad & = & d_2 \ { ^2 ^2 ( + ) + ^2 ( 1 - ) + b _ 12 + b ^2 ( + ) + & & + b ( 1 - -  ) - b^2 ( _ 12 + _ 12 ) - ( u  + ) } . it may be checked that this agrees with the divergent parts of eq . ( [ ct ] ) using the explicit form of the coefficients @xmath250 , @xmath251 and @xmath196 : c_1 & = & 2 ^2 ( +  ) + 2 b ( 2 _ 12 + + _ 12 ) + 2 b^2 ( _ 12 + _ 12 ) + c_2 & = & - ^2 ( 2 + 4 + ^2  ) - b ( 2 _ 12 + 4 _ 12 + ^2_12  ) + u  + c_3 & = & - ^2 ( 2 + ) - b ( 2_12 + _ 12 ) + . we now discuss the chiral ordering of the above counterterms in the lagrangian ( [ pje0 ] ) . to do so , it helpful to evaluate the divergent integrals of eqs . ( [ quartdiv ] ) , ( [ quaddiv ] ) and ( [ logdiv ] ) using dimensional regularization . this gives d_4 & = & = - ( + + ( 3 ) ) + d_2 & = & = - ( + + ( 2 ) ) + d_0 & = & = ( + + ( 1 ) ) . [ dimregds ] here , we have included @xmath252 explicitly in the kaon propagator . a factor of @xmath253 has been subsumed in @xmath93 which is introduced so that the dimension of the integral is independent of the dimensionality of spacetime . the parameter @xmath254 , where @xmath182 is the dimensionality of the integral , and @xmath255 is the digamma function @xcite . in minimal subtraction the integrals of eq . ( [ dimregds ] ) are regulated by removing the @xmath256 terms . it is then evident that in the chiral expansion @xmath245 , @xmath230 and @xmath234 are @xmath257 , @xmath2 and @xmath258 respectively . to evaluate the chiral order of counterterms , we promote the nucleon fields in @xmath85 to dynamical fields . we may then determine the chiral order of counterterms from weinberg s counting rule ( [ count ] ) , either directly from the tree - level counterterms or from the representation of these terms as one - loop diagrams . counterterms ( [ mv1 ] ) , ( [ mv2 ] ) and ( [ lvlh ] ) contribute to @xmath259 . expanding to lowest order in the fields @xmath53 and @xmath54 , these terms renormalize the kaon - nucleon vector interaction coupling constant . counterterms ( [ mh1 ] ) , ( [ mh2 ] ) and ( [ lhsq ] ) contribute to @xmath260 . to lowest order in the fields , they contribute to wave function renormalization . ( [ mu ] ) is also @xmath257 , but to lowest order in the fields gives an overall irrelevant constant and a mass renormalization . ( [ lv ] ) contributes to @xmath261 and yields a four - nucleon interaction to lowest order in the fields .    in this appendix , we have not discussed logarithmic divergences . we believe the cancellation of @xmath0 dependent logarithmic divergences will proceed as in the toy model of appendix a. however we have not derived the full counterterm lagrangian proportional to @xmath234 since this , while in principle straightforward , would involve prohibitively complicated algebra . the counterterms will have a chiral order which ranges from 0 to 4 as can be seen from eqs . ( [ masslike ] ) and ( [ dervs ] ) in conjunction with eqs . ( [ lterms ] ) and ( [ mterms ] ) . in conclusion we note that although we have referred to chiral counting throughout this manuscript , our lagrangian should be regarded as a `` u(1 ) '' or `` o(2 ) '' analogue of the chiral expansion . in this appendix , we derive the critical density from the kaon 2-point function to one - loop order and show that it is equal to that obtained from expanding the zero point energy . close to threshold , the grand potential may be expanded in terms of the condensate as follows = - d^-1 ( ) f^2 ^ 2 + o(^4 ) [ threshold ] where @xmath27 is the zero - momentum kaon propagator , relevant for _ s_-wave condensation , and @xmath0 is the lepton chemical potential prior to kaon condensation . the threshold for kaon condensation is therefore given by @xmath262 , _ i.e. _ the density at which the energy of negatively charged kaons equals the lepton chemical potential .    from the chiral lagrangian , eq . ( [ lkaon ] ) , we may read off the interactions . the 2-point interactions are _ u2 = - ( m_k^2+c ) k^+k^- , l_v2 = -i b k^+k^- . [ tps ] here we treat the standard mass term as an interaction and take the kaon propagator to be massless . the 4-point interactions are @xcite _ h4 & = & ( k^+k^- ) ^2 , l_v4 = - ( k^+k^- ) k^+k^- + l_u4 & = & ( k^+k^- ) ^2 . we compute the kaon 2-point function with external four - momentum @xmath263 . the interactions ( [ tps ] ) contribute at tree - level . to one - loop order , we have the diagrams of fig . 3 . the contributions of figs . 3(a ) , 3(b ) and 3(c ) are @xmath264 , @xmath265 and @xmath266 , respectively . in the last two diagrams , the internal lines contain the interactions given in eq . ( [ tps ] ) , which are denoted by @xmath252 and @xmath85 , respectively . 3(d ) contributes @xmath267 , and fig . 3(e ) contributes @xmath268 . in addition , we must include all possible insertions of the interactions ( [ tps ] ) on internal lines . including the counterterm contribution , the result is d^-1 ( ) & = & ^2 + 2 b - m_k^2 -c + ( ^2 - 4b - m_k^2-c ) + & = & - ( - 2 ( d_2+f_2 ) + 2 ^2 ( d_0+f_0 ) ) [ dinverse ] eq . ( [ dinverse ] ) agrees with the expansion of @xmath165 given in eq . ( [ uc ] ) , as required , and in vacuum we obtain the free inverse propagator @xmath269 . note that figs . 3(a ) , ( c ) , and the contribution to ( d ) proportional to @xmath270 , do not involve nucleon fields and are mass and wavefunction renormalization diagrams in the vacuum . these diagrams are @xmath257 . if we promote the nucleon fields to dynamical ones , we generate nucleon legs on figs . 3(b ) and ( e ) , corresponding to figs . 1(g ) and 1(f ) respectively , and find that they are @xmath4 . these diagrams correspond to figs . 1(a ) and 1(b ) of ref.@xcite respectively ; since only nucleon and kaon fields are used in the present calculation , the remaining diagrams of ref.@xcite do not enter . ellis , r. knorren and m. prakash , phys . * b349 * , 11 ( 1995 ) ; r. knorren , m. prakash and p.j . ellis , phys . rev . * c52 * , 3470 ( 1995 ) ; j. schaffner and i.n . mishustin , phys . rev . * c53 * , 1416 ( 1996 ) ; j. schaffner , j. bondorf and i.n . mishustin , strangeness 96 ( budapest , hungary , 1996 ) heavy ion physics , to be pub . , nucl - th/9607019 . m. prakash , i. bombaci , m. prakash , p. j. ellis , j. m. lattimer and r. knorren , nucl - th/9603042 , phys .

[ fig2]a and two @xmath34 transitions shown in fig .  [ fig2]b are smooth ; however , all other @xmath8 dependences shown in fig . [ fig2 ] contain sharp features . the sharp feature in the curve describing the @xmath42 transition rates ( fig . [ fig2]b ) is explained by irregularity in the curve describing the @xmath28 energy shown in fig . this irregularity in the energy @xmath8 dependence was already discussed in the previous section . the sharp minima in the region @xmath43 in the curves describing the @xmath35 transition rates shown in fig .  [ fig2]c are due to inversion of the order of @xmath44 and @xmath45 energy levels . in the region @xmath43 the @xmath35 transition energies become very small resulting in the small transition rates . the second sharp feature in the curves describing the @xmath35 transition rates shown in fig . [ fig2]c occurs in the region @xmath8 = 72 - 73 and results from the irregularity in the second - order correction to the @xmath35 dipole matrix elements . below , we describe some details of the calculation to clarify this issue . a typical contribution from one of the second - order rpa corrections to dipole matrix element ( @xmath46 ) has the form @xcite @xmath47\propto \sum_{nb } \sum_{k } \frac{d_{nb}x_{k}(vnv'b)}{\epsilon _ { n}+\epsilon _ { v}-\epsilon _ { v'}-\epsilon _ { b}}\ , .\ ] ] here , the index @xmath48 designates a core state and index @xmath49 designates an excited state . the numerator is a product of a dipole matrix element @xmath50 and a coulomb matrix element @xmath51 . for the special case of the @xmath52 transition , the energy denominator for the term in the sum with @xmath53 and @xmath54 is @xmath55 again , as in the case of the second - order @xmath56 energy , there is a nearly zero denominator when the lowest - order energies of the @xmath30 and @xmath57 states are close . the cause of this irregularity is once again traced to the near degeneracy of a single - particle state and a two - particle one - hole state . the remaining irregularities for @xmath7 in the curves presented in fig . [ fig2 ] have similar origins . we calculate lifetimes of @xmath0 and @xmath2 levels in neutral ag and in ag - like ions with @xmath37 using third - order mbpt results for dipole matrix elements and energies . in table [ tab - life ] , we compare our lifetime data with available experimental measurements . this set of data includes results for a limited number of levels in low-@xmath8 ions ( up to @xmath58 ) . we give a more complete comparison of the transition rates and wavelengths for the eleven transitions between @xmath59 and @xmath44 states in ag - like ions with @xmath60 including the third - order contribution in table iii of the accompanying epaps document @xcite . in table [ tab - life ] , we present our lifetime data @xmath61 calculated in the lowest- , second- , and third - order approximations . these results are listed in columns labeled @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 , respectively . the largest difference between the calculations in different approximations occurs for @xmath30 and @xmath28 levels for @xmath8 = 51 and 52 when @xmath65 transition energies become very small and contributions from the second and third orders become very important . it should be noted that for some levels of neutral ag and ag - like ions with @xmath8 = 48 and 49 , @xmath64 agrees better with @xmath62 than with @xmath63 . the accuracy of lifetime measurements is not very high for ag - like ions , and in some cases the lowest - order results @xmath62 , which are equivalent to the dirac - fock results of @xcite were enough to predict the lifetimes . the more sophisticated theoretical studies published recently in refs .  @xcite were restricted to @xmath66 transitions and did not include wavelength data . in two last columns of table  [ tab - life ] , we compare our theoretical wavelengths , @xmath67 with experimental measurements , @xmath68 . in the cases where more than one transition is allowed , the wavelength of the dominant transition is given . we find good agreement , 0.01 - 1% , of our wavelength results with available experimental data for ions with @xmath69 . in summary , a systematic rmbpt study of the energies of @xmath12 , @xmath27 , @xmath25 , @xmath30 , @xmath28 , @xmath31 , @xmath29 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath32 states in ag - like ions is presented . these energy calculations are found to be in good agreement with existing experimental energy data and provide a theoretical reference database for the line identification . a systematic relativistic rmbpt study of reduced matrix elements , line strengths , oscillator strengths , and transition rates for the 17 possible @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 electric - dipole transitions in ag - like ions throughout the isoelectronic sequence up to @xmath73 is conducted . both length and velocity forms of matrix elements are evaluated . small differences between length and velocity - form calculations , caused by the nonlocality of the df potential , are found in second order . however , including third - order corrections with full rpa leads to complete agreement between the length- and velocity - form results . we believe that our energies and transition rates will be useful in analyzing existing experimental data and planning new experiments . there remains a paucity of experimental data for many of the higher ionized members of this sequence , both for term energies and for transition probabilities and lifetimes . the work of w. r. j. and i. m. s. was supported in part by national science foundation grant no . phy-01 - 39928 . u.i.s . acknowledges partial support by grant no . b516165 from lawrence livermore national laboratory .","This text is a research paper that presents a study on the third-order relativistic many-body perturbation theory (RMBPT) calculations of the energy levels and transition rates of ions with one valence electron outside a closed core.

"the flavor evolution of supernova ( sn ) neutrinos , is strongly impacted by the self - induced effects , associated with instabilities induced by the the neutrino - neutrino interactions in the deepest stellar regions  @xcite ( see also  @xcite for a recent review ) . in this context a key ingredient in the characterization of these effects is related to the current - current nature of low - energy weak interactions , which implies a `` multi - angle term ''  @xcite @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the neutrino velocity  @xcite . till recently , all studies have assumed the axial symmetry for this term , that would then depend only on the zenith - angle . it has been shown that the `` multi - zenith - angle '' ( mza ) term in some cases can hinder the maintenance of the coherent oscillation behavior for different neutrino modes  @xcite .    a valuable tool to diagnose the possible instabilities of a dense neutrino gas is given by the linearized stability analysis of the neutrino equations of motion . the linearized equations including generic azimuthal and zenith angle distributions for neutrinos were first worked out in  @xcite . then , the formalism for the azimuthal symmetric case was further developed in  @xcite . the stability method would allow one to determine the possible onset of the flavor conversions , seeking for an exponentially growing solution of the eigenvalue problem , associated with the linearized equations of motion for the neutrino ensemble . recently , this method has been applied in  @xcite removing the assumption of axial symmetry in the @xmath6 propagation . as a result , a multi - azimuthal - angle ( maa ) instability was found in addition to the bimodal  @xcite and mza ones  @xcite . in particular , it was considered a neutrino ensemble with a strong excess of @xmath7 over @xmath8 , as expected during the sn accretion phase ( at post - bounce times @xmath9  s ) . in this situation , the instability has been found in normal mass hierarchy ( nh , @xmath10 ) , where the system would have been stable imposing the perfect axial symmetry . subsequently , the role of this instability has been clarified in  @xcite with simple toy models . the discovery of the new maa effects , has also motivated first numerical studies of the non - linear neutrino propagation equations in sn , introducing the azimuthal angle as angular variable in the multi - angle kernel , in addition to the usual zenith angle  @xcite . remarkably it was considered the @xmath6 propagation only along a radial direction , i.e. a local solution along a specific line of sight , under the assumption that the transverse variations of the global solution are small . in this approximation , for the unstable case discussed above , maa effects lead in nh to spectral swaps and splits analogous to what produced in inverted hierarchy ( ih , @xmath11 ) by the known bimodal instability  @xcite also in a completely isotropic neutrino gas  @xcite . all these recent works assume that the maa effects can develop without any matter hindrance . remarkably , a crucial ingredient to be considered to determine the impact of self - induced flavor instabilities is the ordinary matter term , associated with the net electron densities @xmath12 in sne . as pointed out in  @xcite for the axial - symmetric case , when @xmath12 is not negligible with respect to the neutrino density @xmath13 , the large phase dispersion induced by the matter for @xmath6 s traveling in different directions , would partially or totally suppress the self - induced oscillations through peculiar mza effects . recent studies of this case performed with realistic sn models , indicates that this situation is realized during the supernova accretion phase ( at post - bounce times @xmath9  s ) . as a consequence , the self - induced flavor conversions found in ih in the axial - symmetric models are strongly inhibited  @xcite .    from a preliminary schematic study done in  @xcite it results that the matter density required to suppress the mma instability in nh is larger than the one necessary to suppress the self - induced conversions in ih for the axial symmetric case . motivated by these previous results , we find it is mandatory to understand what is the role of the dense matter on the maa effects during the accretion phase . we will use as benchmark for the neutrino and matter density profiles the sn models from recent long term simulations of core - collapse explosions , performed by the basel - darmstadt model . these were already considered by some of us in  @xcite . the plan of our work is as follows . in sec .  2 we present the neutrino equations of flavor evolution without imposing axial asymmetry . then , we describe the setup to perform the stability analysis of the linearized equations of motion . in sec . 3 we present the results of the stability analysis and we compare them with the numerical solution of the equations . we focus on the accretion phase for two different sn progenitor models . finally , in sec . 4 we comment on our results and we conclude . in the axial symmetric case , the sn neutrino flavor evolution is described by ordinary differential equations  @xcite , characterizing the flavor changes along a radial direction . when axial symmetry is broken by the maa effects , in order to get the global solution of the problem in general one would consider also variations along the transverse direction to the neutrino propagation . this would imply passing from ordinary to partial differential equations , with a big layer of complication in the numerical solution . however , in our study we are mostly interested in answering the question of the stability of the dense neutrino gas under mma effects , in the presence of a large matter term . therefore , _ before _ the maa instability emerges , we can still consider the ordinary differential equations in the only radial direction . these are enough to determine which cases are completely stable under maa effects . in the other cases , in which the maa instability develops , these equations would be useful to determine the onset radius of the flavor conversions . nevertheless , the subsequent flavor evolution can be taken just as indicative , since it is based on the assumption that variations in the transverse direction always remain small .    under this approximation , the flavor evolution depends only on @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath5 . then , following  @xcite we write the equations of motion for the flux matrices @xmath16 as function of the radial coordinate . we use negative energy @xmath15 for anti - neutrinos . following the usual prescription , we label the zenith angular mode in terms of the variable @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the emission angle relative to the radial direction of the neutrinosphere radius @xmath19  @xcite . we call @xmath20 the azimuth angle of the neutrino velocity @xmath21 . we normalize the flux matrices to the @xmath22 number flux at the neutrinosphere . the diagonal @xmath16 elements are the ordinary number fluxes integrated over a sphere of radius @xmath14 . the off - diagonal elements , which are initially zero , carry a phase information due to flavor mixing . then , the equations of motion read  @xcite @xmath23 \,\ , \label{eq : eom1}\ ] ] with the hamiltonian  @xcite @xmath24 the matrix @xmath25 of neutrino mass - squares causes vacuum flavor oscillations . we work in a two - flavor scenario , associated with the atmospheric mass - square difference @xmath26  ev@xmath27 and a small ( matter suppressed ) in - medium mixing @xmath28 . we will always consider nh , where maa effect could emerge for the flux ordering we are considering . the matrix @xmath29 in flavor basis , contains the net electron density and is responsible for the mikheyev - smirnov - wolfenstein ( msw ) matter effect  @xcite with the ordinary background . finally , the term at second line represents the @xmath6-@xmath6 refractive term , where @xmath30 . in the multi - angle term of eq . ( [ eq : eom2 ] ) , the radial velocity of a mode with angular label @xmath31 is @xmath32  @xcite and the transverse velocity is @xmath33  @xcite . the term @xmath34 is the responsible for the breaking of the axial symmetry .    to solve numerically eq . ( [ eq : eom1 ] ) we use an integration routine for stiff ordinary differential equations taken from the nag libraries  @xcite and based on an adaptive method . we have used @xmath35 modes for @xmath36 $ ] , @xmath37 for @xmath38 $ ] . concerning neutrino emission model , in order to simplify the complexity of our numerical simulations of the flavor evolution , we assume all @xmath6 s to be represented by a single energy , that we fix at @xmath39  mev . this approximation is reasonable since our main purpose is to determine only if the dense matter effects block the development of the self - induced transformations .      in order to perform the stability analysis , we linearize the equations of motion [ eq . ( [ eq : eom2 ] ) ] , following the approach of  @xcite . we write the flux matrices in the form @xmath40 where we switch to the frequency variable @xmath41 , and we introduce the neutrino flux difference distributions @xmath42 that represent the flavor fluxes @xmath43 at the neutrinosphere , normalized to the @xmath22 flux . in the following we will always assume axial symmetry of the neutrino emission . therefore @xmath44 . the @xmath45 is conserved and then irrelevant for the flavor conversions . the @xmath7 survival probability is @xmath46 , given in terms of the swap factor @xmath47 of the matrix in the second term on the right - hand side . the off - diagonal components @xmath48 are complex and @xmath49 . the initial conditions are @xmath50 and @xmath51 . self - induced flavor transitions start when the off - diagonal term @xmath48 grows exponentially .    in the small - amplitude limit @xmath52 , and at far distances from the neutrinosphere @xmath53 , the linearized evolution equations for @xmath48 assume the form  @xcite @xmath54 s   \nonumber \\ & - & \mu \int   d \gamma^\prime [ u + u^\prime - 2\sqrt{u u^\prime } \cos ( \varphi-\varphi^\prime)]g^\prime s^\prime \label{eq : lin } \,\ .\end{aligned}\ ] ] in this equation @xmath55 , quantifies the `` asymmetry '' of the neutrino spectrum , normalized to the @xmath22 number flux . in the sn models we are using , typically @xmath56 during the accretion phase ( see fig . 3 in  @xcite ) . the @xmath6-@xmath6 interaction strength is given by @xmath57}{4 \pi r^2}\frac{r_{\nu}^2}{2 r^2 } \nonumber \\ & = & \frac{3.5 \times 10^{9}}{r^4 } \left(\frac{l_{{\overline\nu}_e}}{\langle e_{{\overline\nu}_e } \rangle } - \frac{l_{{\overline\nu}_x}}{\langle e_{{\overline\nu}_x } \rangle } \right ) \nonumber \\ & \times & \left(\frac{15 \,\ \textrm{mev } } { 10^{52 } \,\ \textrm{erg / s}}\right )    \left(\frac{r_{\nu}}{10 \,\ \textrm{km } } \right)^2 ,    \label{eq : mu}\end{aligned}\ ] ] while ordinary matter background term is given by @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the net electron fraction , and @xmath60 is the matter density . the radial distance @xmath14 is expressed in km , while the numerical values of @xmath61 and @xmath62 in the two previous equations are quoted in km@xmath63 , as appropriate for the sn case . one can write the solution of the linear differential equation [ eq .  ( [ eq : lin ] ) ] in the form @xmath64 with complex frequency @xmath65 and eigenvector @xmath66 . a solution with @xmath67 would indicate an exponential increase in @xmath48 , i.e. an instability . the solution of eq . ( [ eq : lin ] ) can then be recast in the form of an eigenvalue equation for @xmath66 . one gets as consistency condition  @xcite @xmath68    a flavor instability is present whenever eq . ( [ consit ] ) admits a solution @xmath69 . we consider the core - collapse supernova simulations of massive stars with 8.8 and 10.8  @xmath2 progenitor from ref . @xcite , taken as benchmark for our numerical study in  @xcite . the first type of sn belongs to the class of o - ne - mg - core progenitor . the second one is an iron - core progenitor .    under the single - energy approximation we are using , we characterize the neutrino energy spectra as @xmath70 \,\ , \label{singleen }   \end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath71 are the total number fluxes of the species @xmath72 at the neutrinosphere . in order to fix the neutrinosphere radius @xmath73 , consistently with our choice in  @xcite we take the radius at which the @xmath7 s angular distribution has no longer significant backward flux , i.e. a few % of the total one . this typically is in the range @xmath74  km ( see fig .  4 in  @xcite ) .    for our choice of neutrino representative energy ( @xmath39  mev ) , the corresponding frequency is @xmath75 the @xmath76 represent the zenith - angle distributions . in our study we assume two different models . at first , we consider the `` half - isotropic '' case , where in analogy with a black - body emission , it is assumed @xmath77 for all the species . we will then compare the results obtained in this widely used prescription , with the one obtained taking the @xmath76 directly from the output of the sn simulations . in this case , the zenith - angle distributions would be flavor - dependent and forward enhanced ( i.e. peaked at small @xmath31 ) with respect to the half - isotropic emission model ( see fig .  1 and the discussion in  @xcite ) . we will see that the presence of forward peaked distributions will enhance the matter suppression of the maa instability . finally , we comment that our results are based on axial symmetric neutrino angular distributions . in this regard , it is interesting to mention that in  @xcite it has been shown that if perfect cylindrical symmetry in the initial neutrino distributions were given up , super - fast flavor turnovers could be produced . we leave the investigation of this interesting issue for a future work . progenitor mass . radial evolution of the ratio @xmath78 between the matter @xmath62 and neutrino @xmath61 potentials at different post - bounce times.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]      we start our investigation with the case of the @xmath1  @xmath2 iron - core supernova . for this model , the net electron density @xmath12 and the neutrino densities @xmath13 for different post - bounce times were shown in fig . 5 of ref . @xcite . in order to quantify the relative strength of the matter potential @xmath62 [ eq .  ( [ eq : lambda ] ) ] with respect to the neutrino potential @xmath61 [ eq .  ( [ eq : mu ] ) ] we plot in fig . 1 the ratio @xmath79 as a function of the radial coordinate @xmath14 at different post - bounce times @xmath80 in the range [ 0.1,0.6 ]  s. we realize that @xmath81 before the abrupt discontinuity associated with the shock front position . as we will see with the stability analysis , this strong matter dominance would prevent the flavor conversions before the shock front . however , for some time snapshots ( i.e. @xmath82  s ) the ratio can become @xmath83 after the shock front , leaving the possibility of flavor conversions in this region . for the same post - bounce times of fig .  1 , we show in fig . 2 the radial evolution of the eigenvalue @xmath84 determined from the solution of eq . ( [ consit ] ) . we consider the following cases : _ ( a ) _ @xmath85 and a half - isotropic neutrino emission ( dashed curves ) , _ ( b ) _ dense matter effects and a half - isotropic neutrino emission ( continuous curves ) and , _ ( c ) _ dense matter effects and non - trivial neutrino angular distributions ( dotted curves ) . in fig . 3 we show the survival probability @xmath86 for electron antineutrinos @xmath87 for the same cases of fig .  2 , obtained solving the non - linear propagation equations [ eq . ( [ eq : eom2 ] ) ] . we start discussing our results for the case of @xmath85 [ case _ ( a ) _ ] . we realize that when the neutrino system enters the unstable regime ( @xmath67 ) , the @xmath84 function rapidly grows from zero to a peak value greater than one . only for @xmath88  s @xmath89 at the peak . indeed , for this time the asymmetry parameter @xmath90 ( see fig . 3 in  @xcite ) . then the consistency condition eq . ( [ consit ] ) in order to be satisfied requires a smaller @xmath84 . comparing the results of fig .  2 and 3 one finds a good agreement between the numerical onset of the self - induced flavor conversions triggered by the maa effect and the position of the peak in the @xmath84 function . we now discuss the situation of realistic matter density profiles and a half - isotropic neutrino emission [ case _ ( b ) _ ] . as expected , the flavor instability is strongly suppressed with respect to the previous case without matter . in particular , the @xmath84 function , when not completely vanishing ( as at @xmath91  s ) , would start growing only after the shock front position [ see fig .  1 ] . this is due to the fact that at lower radii the ratio @xmath92 . the @xmath84 function then reaches peak values between 0.5 and 1 only at intermediate times , i.e. @xmath93  s , for which the ratio @xmath94 in the post - shock region . for the other time snapshots @xmath84 it is more suppressed , consistently with a larger value of @xmath78 . comparing these results with the numerical calculation of the @xmath86 in fig .  3 , we realize that the presence of a non - zero @xmath84 is not enough to guarantee the onset of flavor conversions . indeed , for @xmath95  s , the @xmath84 function is too small and dies out too quickly before triggering flavor conversions . for the cases in which flavor conversions occur , i.e. at @xmath96  s , the numerical onset is shifted at larger radii by few hundred km , with respect to the peak of the @xmath84 function . this delay is due to the fact that since the instability is weaker with respect to the case with @xmath85 , the slower rate of growth implies a larger radial distance in order to develop significant effects on the @xmath86 . we checked that a non - zero @xmath84 corresponds to the exponential growth of the off - diagonal components @xmath97 of the flux matrices [ see eq . ( [ eq : phi ] ) ] , while the change of the diagonal components , would occur only at larger radii . it would be interesting to see if the stability analysis can be further developed in order to achieve a better understanding of this dynamics . then we consider the case in which also the flavor - dependent forward - peaked neutrino angular distributions are taken into account [ case _ ( c ) _ ] . we find that the @xmath84 function in this case is completely suppressed . this is consistent with the expectation that the @xmath6-@xmath6 strength is weaker for forward - peaked distributions , making more effective the matter suppression . this result is consistent with the output of the numerical simulations that show for all the considered time snapshots @xmath98 . finally we mention that in  @xcite it has been claimed that possible residual scatterings could affect @xmath6 s after the neutrinosphere , producing a small `` neutrino halo '' that would broaden the @xmath6 angular distributions  @xcite at @xmath99  km . we checked that the results of the sn simulations we are using have not enough angular resolution to exhibit this feature . however , in order to characterize the possible halo effect , we performed the same analytical estimation presented in  @xcite . we repeated the stability analysis including the halo effect in the @xmath6 angular distributions , without finding any change with respect to the results shown here . therefore , we conclude that for our @xmath1  @xmath2 sn model , maa instability is always suppressed by the dense matter effects during the accretion phase . progenitor mass . radial evolution of the @xmath84 function ( in units of km@xmath63 ) at different post - bounce times with @xmath85 for a half - isotropic neutrino emission ( dashed curves ) and in presence of matter effects , with a half - isotropic neutrino emission ( continuous curves ) and with flavor - dependent angular distributions ( dotted curves).,scaledwidth=50.0% ]     progenitor mass . radial evolution of the survival probability @xmath86 for electron antineutrinos at different post - bounce times for the maa evolution with @xmath85 for a half - isotropic neutrino emission ( dashed curves ) and in presence of matter effects , with a half - isotropic neutrino emission ( continuous curves ) and with flavor - dependent angular distributions ( dotted curves).,scaledwidth=50.0% ]       progenitor mass . radial evolution of the ratio @xmath78 between the matter @xmath62 and neutrino @xmath61 potentials at different post - bounce times.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in this section we analyze the flavor conversions for the model of @xmath3  @xmath2 o - ne - mg progenitor . in fig .  4 we plot the ratio @xmath79 for the same time snapshots of fig . 9 of  @xcite , i.e. in the range [ 0.08,0.25 ]  s. we realize that in this case there is no abrupt discontinuity associated with the shock front . indeed , for this low - mass progenitor there is no extended accretion phase , since the explosion succeeds very shortly after the core - bounce . therefore , the shock - front is already beyond the radial range interesting for the flavor conversions . since in this case the matter density of the envelope is low compared to the iron - core progenitors , the electron density profile above the core is very steep . therefore , at @xmath100 few hundred km , the ratio @xmath101 [ for @xmath102~s$ ] it monotonically decreases becoming also smaller than 1 ] suggests that flavor conversions could arise there .    in fig .  5 we show the radial evolution of the eigenvalue @xmath84 for the time snapshots shown in fig .  4 , determined from the solution of eq . ( [ consit ] ) . we use the same format of fig .  2 . in fig . 6 we show the corresponding survival probability @xmath86 for electron antineutrinos @xmath87 . starting with the case without matter term , i.e. @xmath85 ( dashed curves ) , we see that the @xmath84 function rapidly becomes larger than 1 , and the peak corresponds to the onset of the flavor conversions in fig . we pass now considering the case with @xmath62 and half - isotropic neutrino angular distributions ( continuous curves ) . we realize that , for @xmath103  s in the region where @xmath84 grows , @xmath104 . therefore , the matter suppression of the instability is never complete . moreover , the rise of @xmath84 is rapid and the position of the peak corresponds to the onset of the flavor conversions seen in fig . conversely , for the other time snapshots ( @xmath105  s ) where @xmath106 , the suppression of the instability is stronger . moreover , the @xmath84 curves are broadened and there is not a clear peak . therefore , one can not easily link a non - zero @xmath84 with the numerical onset of the flavor conversions . in the case of @xmath62 and flavor dependent forward - peaked neutrino angular distributions ( dotted curves ) , as expected we find a stronger suppression in the flavor instability . however , as shown in fig . 1 of  @xcite , the angular spectra of different flavors for the 8.8 m@xmath107 sn are significantly less forward - peaked than in the case of the 10.8 m@xmath107 sn . therefore , their effect is less pronounced in this case . in particular , for @xmath108  s , @xmath84 is large enough to trigger flavor conversions . conversely , these are strongly inhibited at @xmath109  s , and completely suppressed for @xmath110  s.    finally , we checked also in this case that including a possible halo effect does not change the results of the stability analysis . in conclusion , for our sn model with 8.8 m@xmath107 progenitor mass the matter suppression of the maa instability is not complete at early times . therefore , in principle one would expect interesting time - dependent features in the observable neutrino spectra . progenitor mass . radial evolution of the @xmath84 function ( in units of km@xmath63 ) at different post - bounce times with @xmath85 for a half -

dependent angular distributions ( dotted curves).,scaledwidth=50.0% ] we have performed a dedicated study of the matter suppression of the maa instability , connected with the axial symmetry breaking in the self - induced oscillations , during the accretion phase for two sn models with different progenitor masses . we characterize the sn densities and the neutrino angular spectra with results from recent sn hydrodynamical simulations . we compared the linear stability analysis with the numerical results of the flavor evolution in which we have looked at a local solution of the equations of motions along a specific line of sight . for the case of an iron - core 10.8 m@xmath107 we found that during the accretion phase the dominant matter density strongly suppresses the maa instability . in particular , including realistic forward - peaked @xmath6 angular distributions significantly reduces the strength of the @xmath6-@xmath6 interaction term . as a result , in this case the matter suppression of the self - induced flavor conversions would be complete . in the case of a low - mass o - ne - mg sn with 8.8 m@xmath107 progenitor , where the accretion phase is extremely short , the matter density profile is lower and the @xmath6 angular distributions less forward - peaked than in iron - core models . as a consequence , we found that also with realistic angular distributions flavor conversions would be possible at early times , producing in principle interesting time - dependent modulations . our analysis is complementary to previous studies  @xcite , where some of us explored the matter suppression of self - induced flavor conversions in inverted neutrino mass hierarchy , in axial - symmetric models ( see also  @xcite ) . the complete suppression of the self - induced effects in both the mass hierarchies for iron - core sne , implies that the neutrino signal during the accretion phase will be processed only by the ordinary mikheyev - smirnov - wolfenstein effect in the outer stellar layers . this effect would allow in principle to distinguish the neutrino mass hierarchy through the study of the rise time of the sn neutrino signal  @xcite . the phenomenological importance of our findings motivates further studies with other sn models to confirm the generality of our results . in particular , an accurate characterization of the neutrino angular distributions seems necessary in order to get accurate predictions on the matter suppression . at this regard , in @xcite it has been shown that if perfect cylindrical symmetry in the initial neutrino distributions were given up , then super - fast flavor turnovers could occur . these effects can not be tested within our spherically symmetric sn model . however , recently three - dimensional sn simulations have been carried on , characterizing the neutrino signal during the accretion phase . surprisingly , a lepton - emission asymmetry among different flavor has been found  @xcite . in particular , the electron ( anti)neutrino fluxes show a dipole structure , while the @xmath111 are almost spherically symmetric . we plan to investigate in a future work the role of the matter suppression in this flavor configuration , including also the not axisymmetric neutrino and matter angular distributions . self - induced flavor conversions associated with the maa instability would still be possible for o - ne - mg sne during the accretion phase , and possibly for iron core sne during the cooling phase , when the matter term becomes sub - dominant with respect to the neutrino - neutrino interaction term . in these situations , a self - consistent treatment of the neutrino equations of motion considering also the flavor evolution along the transverse direction is still lacking . this would imply passing from an ordinary to a partial differential equation problem , adding a big layer of complication in the solution of the equations of motion . this effort is well motivated by the perspective of getting an accurate characterization of the sn neutrino spectral features that would be observable in the planned large underground neutrino detectors  @xcite . we thank t.  fischer , g.  raffelt , s.  sarikas and m.  wu for useful discussions . s.c .  acknowledges support from the european union through a marie curie fellowship , grant no . piif -

"the four - electron li@xmath0 ion is interesting because of the significant role played by electron correlation in the binding of the outermost electron in this weakly bound system . the major contribution to the correlation energy arises from the interaction of the two valence electrons . beyond the three - body h@xmath0 system , the li@xmath0 ion is most tractable to theory . in the frozen core approximation , for example , the li@xmath0 ion becomes an effective three - body system consisting of a pair of highly correlated electrons interacting weakly with an inert core . such a model lends itself well to semi - empirical model potential calculations in which the potential experienced by the valence electrons is obtained via spectral information on the eigenvalue spectrum of the li atom . most calculations of the electron affinity of li to date are of this type , e.g.  moccia et al .  @xcite or graham et al . @xcite ( and references therein ) . recently , however , accurate measurements of this quantity have stimulated ab initio calculations @xcite of comparable accuracy . the most direct , and potentially the most accurate , method of measuring electron affinities is to use the laser threshold photodetachment ( ltp ) method @xcite . here one records , as a function of the wavelength of a tunable laser , the onset of production of either photoelectrons or residual atoms in the vicinity of a detachment threshold . to date , three ltp measurements of the electron affinity of li have been reported . the earliest such experiment was a crossed laser and ion beam experiment by feldman @xcite . he utilized an infrared laser to study the li@xmath4 photodetachment threshold . an accurate threshold energy for a @xmath5-wave detachment was difficult to determine because the cross section rises , according to the wigner law @xcite , only slowly from zero . bae and peterson @xcite used collinear laser and ion beams to investigate the total photodetachment cross section around the li(@xmath6 ) cusp situated at the opening of the li@xmath7 channel . from a careful analysis of this sharp structure they obtained , as one result , an electron affinity value of about the same accuracy as feldman . the measurement of dellwo et al . @xcite was a direct investigation of the resolved li@xmath7 channel threshold using photoelectron spectroscopy . in this experiment , however , doppler broadening associated with the use of crossed laser and ion beams limited the attainable energy resolution . the electron affinity of li determined in the present measurement is an order of magnitude more accurate than previous lpt measurements . we utilized resonance ionization @xcite combined with a collinear laser - ion beam geometry to measure the threshold of the li@xmath7 partial photodetachment cross section . the state selectivity of the resonance ionization method leads to an excellent signal - to - background ratio . this in turn enabled us to attain a resolution limited only by the laser bandwidth of about 0.2  @xmath8 . the present threshold energy measurement clearly demonstrates the potential of the method . the concept of combining collinear laser - ion beam spectroscopy with resonance ionization detection was first proposed by kudriatsev and letokhov @xcite and later applied to isotope detection measurements by the same authors @xcite . balling et al . @xcite and petrunin et al . @xcite have recently used the same technique in photodetachment measurements . the two - color state selective photodetachment experiment described in the present paper is simple in concept . one laser of frequency @xmath9 is used to photodetach li@xmath0 ions producing an excited li atom and a free electron ( fig .  1 ) . a second laser of frequency @xmath10 resonantely photoexcites li atoms left in the @xmath6 state to a rydberg state which subsequently is field ionized . hence , the entire process can be represented by the following steps :    @xmath11    where @xmath12 denoted field ionization and li(@xmath13 ) corresponds to a highly excited rydberg atom in either a @xmath14 or @xmath15 state . state selectivity is accomplished in the resonant ionization step since only li(@xmath6 ) atoms can be ionized via the intermediate rydberg state . in this manner we were able to isolate a particular photodetachment channel , in this case the li(@xmath6 ) channel , and investigate the partial photodetachment cross section by measuring the yield of li@xmath2 ions . the @xmath16li@xmath0 ion beam was produced by charge exchange in a cesium vapor cell of a mass selected li@xmath2 beam from a plasma ion source . an ion current of typically a few na was obtained in the interaction region . the beam energy was approximately 4  kev .    in the interaction chamber ( fig . 2 ) the negative ions interacted with laser light in a region defined by two apertures with a diameter of 3  mm placed 0.5  m apart . the ions were deflected in and out of the laser beam by means of two electrostatic quadrupole deflectors whose symmetry axes were perpendicular to the laser and ion beams . the ion current in the interaction region was monitored with a faraday cup placed after the second quadrupole deflector . rydberg atoms formed in the interaction region travel to the second quadrupole where they are ionized by the same electric field that deflects the negative ion beam into the faraday cup . positive ions formed in this process were deflected in the opposite direction into a positive ion detector . in this detector the fast positive ions impinged on a conducting glass plate producing secondary electrons that were detected with a channel electron multiplier ( cem ) . a metal grid connected to a voltage supply was placed between the glass plate and the cem . this made it possible to either allow or prevent the secondary electrons from reaching the cem . the detection efficiency of the positive ion detector was close to unity . light of frequency @xmath9 was generated by a dye laser operated with coumarine 307 and light of frequency @xmath10 was produced by a dye laser operated with bmq . both dye lasers were pumped by a common xecl excimer laser . the pulse duration of both lasers was about 15  ns . the maximum energy in a laser pulse delivered into the interaction region was 1.5  mj for the radiation of frequency @xmath9 and 200  @xmath17j for the radiation of frequency @xmath10 . during the experiment both lasers were attenuated , as will be discussed below . the two laser pulses counter propagated in the interaction region and arrived simultaneously in the interaction region . a shift of a few ns between the pulses , occurring at both ends of the interaction region , is negligible since the li(@xmath1 ) radiative lifetime is 26.99(16 )  ns @xcite . the frequency @xmath9 was determined by combining fabry - prot fringes with optogalvanic spectroscopy . the fabry - prot fringes served as frequency markers whereas transitions of ne or ar in a hollow cathode lamp provided an absolute calibration of the energy scale . first we had to find an appropriate resonance transition for the laser of frequency @xmath10 . a scan of @xmath10 , during which @xmath9 is set to a frequency far above the li@xmath18 threshold , is shown in fig .  [ uv2 ] . below the ionization limit we found a wealth of lines . due to strong saturation , the intensities of the lines are not    proportional to the corresponding transition probabilities ; close to the ionization limit the detection system became overloaded such that it only recorded one count per laser shot thus attenuating the strongest lines . for most of the lines we also expect the transition itself to be saturated . the rydberg series in fig . [ uv2 ] exhibits a cut off at 28270  @xmath8 indicating that the rydberg atoms were mainly field ionized in an electric field of about 200  kv / m in the second quadrupole deflector . we interpret the lines below the cut off as being due to photoionization . a detailed scan of the transition used for the photodetachment threshold measurements is shown in fig . we identified the two lines as corresponding to transitions from the two fine structure levels @xmath19 to the same rydberg state . the measured separation of 0.33(4 )  @xmath8 between the two lines in fig . [ fein ] corresponds very well to the fine structure splitting of 0.337  @xmath8 of the @xmath1 term @xcite . the resolved fine structure shown in fig .  [ fein ] demonstrates that the energy resolution of the present collinear beam apparatus is approximately 0.2  @xmath8 , which is of the same order as the laser bandwidth .      a typical measurement of the li(2@xmath5 ) photodetachment threshold with anti - parallel laser and ion beams is shown in fig . the laser frequency @xmath10 was held constant and the intensity was set to saturate the transition to the rydberg state . the frequency @xmath9 was then scanned over the li(@xmath6 ) threshold . it was established that two processes contributed to the background , namely ( a ) : @xmath20 and ( b ) two - electron collisional ionization . process ( a ) produced nearly 80% of the background , even though the intensity of the laser light with frequency @xmath10 was attenuated . process ( b ) , two - electron collisional ionization , contributed the remaining background at the operating pressure of @xmath21  mbar ( @xmath22  pa ) . this contribution was found to be proportional to the pressure and is thus dominated by single collision double detachment , as has been discussed previously by bae and peterson @xcite . the laser intensities were too low for other processes , such as direct two - electron multiphoton detachment , to influence the experiment . close to the photodetachment threshold the cross section @xmath23 is well represented by the wigner law @xcite ( eq .  [ eqwig ] ) . if @xmath24 is the threshold energy and @xmath25 the photon energy , the wigner law for electrons detached with different angular momenta @xmath26 can be written as @xmath27 for the desired first step process in eq . [ stepone ] , both @xmath28- and @xmath29-wave final states for the detached electron are allowed by parity and total angular momentum conservation . at the threshold , however , the @xmath28-wave cross section , starting with an infinite slope , completely dominates over the @xmath29-wave cross section . we fitted the wigner law ( eq . [ eqwig ] ) for @xmath28-wave detachment ( @xmath30 ) to the recorded positive ion signal . the data shown in fig .  [ wig ] was recorded with the laser ( @xmath9 ) anti - parallel to the ion beam . the fit window is the range of the plotted line . the fit yields a value for the red - shifted threshold energy , @xmath31 . in order to eliminate the doppler shift we repeated the measurements using parallel laser and ion beams to determine the blue - shifted threshold energy , @xmath32 the threshold energy corrected for the doppler to all orders , @xmath24 , is given by the geometric mean of the two measurements : @xmath33    the interaction of the induced dipole moment of the atom with the electron will limit the range of validity of the wigner law . omalley @xcite obtained an expression which accounts for the residual induced - dipole point - charge interaction , @xmath34\quad , \ ] ] where @xmath35 and @xmath36 is in atomic units . this equation can be used to estimate an approximate range of validity for the wigner law by determining the conditions under which the second term , and therefore higher terms , become negligible . with a dipole polarizibility of @xmath37 for the li @xmath1 state @xcite , the second term is much less than unity up to 1  @xmath8 above the threshold , and consequently the wigner law should be applicable over this range . this , of course , assumes that there are no resonances in this region , a condition which has been previously established by dellwo et al.@xcite . saturation of the signal can originate in the photodetachment process or the detection system . in the data shown in fig . [ wig ] the detection system starts to saturate at about 250 counts ( for 100 laser pulses ) . we attenuated the intensity of the laser of frequency @xmath9 sufficiently to avoid any saturation of the signal within the first 1.0  @xmath8 above the threshold .    to determine the electron affinity of li we had to subtract the well known @xmath38 transition energy of 14903.648130(14 )  @xmath8 @xcite from the measured doppler-    .comparison of different measurements and calculations of the li electron affinity . [ cols=""<,^ "" , ]     corrected threshold energy @xmath24 ( eq .  [ schwelle ] ) . we determined the li electron affinity to be 4984.90(17 )  @xmath8 . to the error there are two major contributions : 0.13  @xmath8 is due to a calibration uncertainty of the hollow cathode lamps , and the rest is due to statistical scattering of the fitted threshold values .    in order to convert our electron affinity in @xmath8 to ev we used the recommended factor of ( 1/8065.5410 ) @xmath39 $ ] @xcite and obtained 0.618049(20 )  ev . in fig . [ ealithium ] this value is compared with previous experiments . these values are also compiled in tab . [ tab1 ] together with some recently calculated li electron affinities . we have demonstrated that photodetachment spectroscopy combined with resonance ionization is a powerful method for studying partial photodetachment cross sections of negative ions . the collinear beam geometry simultaneously provides high sensitivity , due to the large interaction volume , and excellent resolution , due to velocity compression . i addition , removal of the doppler shift to all orders can be achieved by use of two separate measurements involving parallel and anti - parallel laser and ion beams . both merits can be fully retained for channel specific photodetachment investigations with the excitation scheme used in this experiment . our improved li electron affinity of 0.618049(20 )  ev reveals the potential of this method , and this method can , in principle , be extended to essentially all elements . we are currently developing this type of state - selective detection scheme in connection with on - going studies of high lying doubly excited states of the li@xmath0 ion @xcite . financial support for this research has been obtained from the swedish natural science research council ( nfr ) . personal support was received from the wenner - gren center foundation for igor kiyan . david pegg acknowledge the support from the swedish institute and and the us department of energy , office of basic energy sciences , division of chemical sciences .","The four-electron LiXe ion is an interesting system due to the significant role played by electron correlation in the binding of the outermost electron in this weakly bound system.

"the free energy ( or potential of mean force ) is the thermodynamic force driving structural processes such as conformational changes of macromolecules in aqueous solution , ligand binding at the active site of an enzyme , protein - protein association , etc . the free energy gives information about both the rate at which these processes occur and the mechanism by which they occur . this makes free energy calculations a central issue in biophysics . molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations provide a tool for performing such calculations on a computer in a way which is potentially both precise and inexpensive ( e.g.  @xcite ) . since a free energy is in essence the logarithm of a probability density function ( see  ( [ eq : free ] ) below for a precise definition ) it can in principle be calculated by histogram methods based on the binning of an md trajectory . this direct approach , however , turns out to be unpractical in general because the time scale required for the trajectory to explore all the relevant regions of configuration space is prohibitively long . probably the best known and most widely used technique to get around this difficulty is the weighted histogram analysis method ( wham )  @xcite . following  @xcite , wham adds artificial biasing potentials to maintain the md system in certain umbrella sampling windows . wham then recombines in an optimal way the histograms from all the biased simulations to compute the free energy . wham is much more efficient than the direct sampling approach , and generalizations such as  @xcite alleviate somewhat the problem of where to put the umbrella windows ( usually , this requires some _ a  priori _ knowledge of the free energy landscape ) . in practice , however , wham remains computationally demanding and it only works to compute the free energy in 2 or 3 variables . an interesting alternative to wham is metadynamics  @xcite . in essence metadynamics is a way to use an md trajectory to place inverted umbrella sampling windows on - the - fly and use these windows both to bias the md simulation and as histogram bins to sample the free energy directly ( thereby bypassing the need of further histogram analysis in each window ) . both wham and metadynamics compute the free energy directly by histogram methods , but an alternative approach is possible . unlike the free energy which is a global quantity , its negative gradient ( known as the mean force ) can be expressed in terms of a local expectation and thereby computed at a given point in the free energy landscape . this is the essence of the blue moon sampling strategy  @xcite and it offers the possibility to calculate first the mean force at a given set of locations , then use this information to reconstruct the free energy globally . in one dimension , this approach is known as thermodynamic integration and it goes back to kirkwood  @xcite . in higher dimensions , however , this way to compute free energies has been impeded by two issues . the first is where to place the points at which to compute the mean force , and the second is how to reconstruct the free energy from these data    in this paper , we propose a method , termed single - sweep method , which addresses both of these issues in two complementary but independent steps . in a first step , we use the temperature - accelerated molecular dynamics ( tamd ) proposed in  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) to quickly sweep through the important regions of the free energy landscape and identify points in these regions where to compute the mean force . in the second step we then reconstruct the free energy globally from the mean force by representing the free energy using radial - basis functions , and adjusting the parameters in this representation via minimization of an objective function . the single - sweep method is easy to use and implement , does not require _ a  priori _ knowledge of the free energy landscape , and can be applied to map free energies in several variables ( up to four , as demonstrated here , and probably more ) . the single - sweep method is also very efficient , especially since the mean force calculations can be performed using independent calculations on distributed processors ( i.e. using grid computing facilities  @xcite ) . the reminder of this paper is organized as follows . in sec . [ sec : theory ] , we describe the two steps of the single - sweep method in detail , starting with the second one for convenience . in sec . [ sec : app1 ] we illustrate the method on a simple two - dimensional example . this example is then used for comparison with metadynamics in sec . [ sec : metadynamics ] . in sec . [ sec : ad ] we use the single - sweep method to compute the free energy of alanine dipeptide ( ad ) in solution in two and in four of its dihedral angles . finally , concluding remarks are made in sec . [ sec : conclu ] and the details of the md calculation on ad are given in appendix  [ sec : md ] we shall consider a molecular system with @xmath0 degrees of freedom whose position in configuration space  @xmath1 will be denoted by @xmath2 . we also introduce a set of @xmath3 collective variables @xmath4 which are functions of @xmath2 such as torsion angles , interatomic distances , etc . if @xmath5 denotes the potential energy of the system and @xmath6 its temperature , the free energy @xmath7 in the variables @xmath8 is defined as @xmath9 so that @xmath10 is , up to a proportionality constant , the probability density function ( pdf ) of the variables  @xmath8 . as mentioned in the introduction , the negative gradient of the free energy , @xmath11 , is known as the mean force , and it can be computed locally at point  @xmath12 via calculation of an expectation ( see  ( [ eq : meanforceapprox ] ) below ) . in this section , we shall suppose that we have obtained an estimate of @xmath13 at points @xmath14 , and we focus on the reconstruction of the free energy @xmath7 from these data . a specific way to pick these points and compute @xmath15 will be given in sec . [ sec : tamd ] , but it is worth pointing out that the reconstruction method proposed here works with data set collected in any other ways .    our reconstruction method uses a radial - basis function representation for the free energy  @xmath7 with centers at @xmath16  @xcite : @xmath17 here @xmath18 is a constant used to adjust the overall height of @xmath19 but is otherwise irrelevant , @xmath20 denotes the euclidean norm in  @xmath21 , and @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a radial - basis function ; a convenient choice is to use the gaussian packet @xmath24 though other radial - basis functions ( multiquadric , sobolev splines , wendland , etc . @xcite ) can be used as well , see sec . [ sec : ad ] . in ( [ eq : radialbasis ] ) the heights @xmath25 and the radial - basis function width @xmath26 are adjustable parameters which we determine by minimizing over @xmath25 and @xmath27 the following objective function , which measures the discrepancy between the negative gradient of the function @xmath28 in ( [ eq : radialbasis ] ) at the centers @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and the mean force @xmath31 estimated at these centers : @xmath32 before explaining how we perform this minimization , let us give several reasons why the radial - basis representation  ( [ eq : radialbasis ] ) for @xmath7 is natural and convenient . first , the centers @xmath29 in  ( [ eq : radialbasis ] ) do not have to lie on a regular grid , which permits to use mean force data collected anywhere . second , the representation  ( [ eq : radialbasis ] ) can be used in any dimension . third , this representation has very good convergence properties , i.e. a small number of centers gives an accurate representation of  @xmath7 . in fact , unlike standard representations based e.g. on linear interpolation on a regular grid , the rate of convergence in @xmath33 of the representation in  ( [ eq : radialbasis ] ) can be made independent of @xmath3 ( a feature which the radial - basis representations share with sparse grids  @xcite ) . going back to the minimization of @xmath34 , it can be performed as follows . for fixed @xmath27 , the  @xmath35 minimizing ( [ eq : objective ] ) solve the following linear algebraic system @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are given by @xmath39 given the centers @xmath29 and the estimates @xmath40 of the mean force at these centers , the coefficients @xmath41 and @xmath42 can be easily computed , and the linear system ( [ eq : linalg ] ) can be solved by any standard technique , e.g. gaussian elimination . once the solution  @xmath43 of  ( [ eq : linalg ] ) is determined , to find the optimal @xmath44 satisfying @xmath45 we compute the residual @xmath46 for increasing values of @xmath27 starting from the distance between the centers . more sophisticated procedures could be used to minimize @xmath46 over @xmath27 , but the brute force method that we used proved to be efficient enough because computing successive solutions of ( [ eq : linalg ] ) for various  @xmath27 is very fast . to measure the error in the approximation , we used the residual per center defined as @xmath47 which reaches its minimum value at the same @xmath44 as @xmath46 . overall , the procedure is simple and inexpensive since the determination of @xmath35 at fixed  @xmath27 is computationally straightforward and cheap , and can be easily repeated to perform the one - dimensional minimization over  @xmath27 . one caveat that we should mention , however , is that the condition number of the matrix @xmath37 increases rapidly when the number of centers and/or @xmath27 increase . this is a known problem of radial - basis functions  @xcite . to avoid any problems , we capped the admissible condition number at @xmath48 and , in situations where this threshold value was reached while @xmath49 was still decreasing , picked for @xmath44 the corresponding value of @xmath27 . these situations only occurred in the two - dimensional example ( see sec . [ sec : app1 ] ) when a lot of centers were used ( 500 or more , i.e. much more than what will be used in the ad example ) , and even in these cases , such a large condition number did not lead to any noticeable loss of accuracy in the results ( even though the coefficients @xmath35 were then very large ) . we also observed that , given a number of centers  @xmath29 and a value of  @xmath27 , the condition number is typically lower when the dimension of @xmath12 is larger . finally , we observed that the condition number was much lower with the wendland radial - basis function ( see ( [ eq : wend ] ) in sec . [ sec : ad ] ) than with the gaussian radial - basis function  ( [ eq : kernel ] ) . it remains to explain how to identify the centers @xmath50 and estimate the mean force at these points . following  @xcite , we will do so using the extended system @xmath51 & \quad + \text{thermostat terms at          $ \beta^{-1}$ }      \end{aligned }      \\[20pt ]      \displaystyle\gamma \dot \zz = \kappa ( \ttheta(\xx ) - \zz ) + \sqrt{2 \gamma        \bar \beta^{-1}}\ , \eeta(t )    \end{cases}\ ] ] where @xmath52 is the mass matrix , @xmath53 is a white - noise , i.e. a gaussian process with mean 0 and covariance @xmath54 , and @xmath55 , the friction coefficient @xmath56 and the artificial inverse temperature @xmath57 are parameters whose role we explain now . the system in  ( [ eq : tamd ] ) describes the motion of @xmath2 and @xmath12 over the extended potential @xmath58 as shown in  @xcite , by adjusting the parameter @xmath59 so that @xmath60 and the friction coefficient @xmath61 so that @xmath12 moves slower than @xmath2 , one can generate a trajectory @xmath62 in @xmath63-space which effectively moves at the artificial temperature @xmath64 on the free energy computed at the physical temperature @xmath6 . by taking @xmath65 , the @xmath62 trajectory visits rapidly the regions where the free energy is relatively low ( i.e. within a range of a few  @xmath64 ) even if these regions are separated by barriers which the system would take a long time to cross at the physical temperature @xmath6 . this gives us a way to determine automatically where are the relevant regions in free energy space . in  @xcite , the extended system in  ( [ eq : tamd ] ) was proposed to sample the free energy landscape directly . here , we make a different use of  ( [ eq : tamd ] ) : we utilize the trajectory  @xmath62 to rapidly sweep through @xmath12-space and generate the centers @xmath16 used in the radial - basis representation  ( [ eq : radialbasis ] ) . specifically , we start from @xmath66 , then deposit a new center @xmath29 along @xmath62 each time @xmath62 reaches a point which is more than a prescribed distance  @xmath67 away from all the previous centers , where @xmath67 is a parameter controlling the density of the covering by the centers ( the smaller @xmath67 , the higher the number of centers deposited ) . at the same time , at each of these centers  @xmath29 , we launch a simulation of  ( [ eq : tamd ] ) with @xmath68 fixed , i.e we use @xmath69         & \quad + \text{thermostat terms at $ \beta^{-1}$ }      \end{aligned}\ ] ] and compute : @xmath70 the calculations of these time averages are independent of each other , and hence they can be distributed , using ( ideally ) at least one processor per center @xmath29 , an approach that optimally fits with the purposes of grid computing  @xcite . the estimator in  ( [ eq : meanforceapprox ] ) has the advantage of being simple , but it introduces an error due to the finiteness of  @xmath71 . this error can be decreased by using  @xmath71 in  ( [ eq : tamd2 ] ) and  ( [ eq : meanforceapprox ] ) larger than @xmath59 in  ( [ eq : tamd ] ) , or even eliminated by using constrained instead of restrained simulations and using the blue - moon estimator for the mean force  @xcite . once the centers @xmath72 have been deposited and the estimates @xmath73 of the mean force at these centers have been obtained , we use the reconstruction procedure explained in sec.[sec : reconstruct ] and compute the optimal set of coefficients @xmath35 and the optimal @xmath44 to use in the representation  ( [ eq : radialbasis ] ) for  @xmath7 . we conclude this section by stressing that using the extended dynamics  ( [ eq : tamd ] ) to sweep through @xmath12-space and deposit the centers  @xmath29 is very different than using it to sample @xmath7 directly , which makes our approach very different from wham or metadynamics . unlike with sampling , revisiting twice a region in @xmath12-space is unnecessary and even undesirable since no new center will be deposited . the accuracy of the reconstruction depends on the number of centers and the accuracy at which the mean force is computed in  ( [ eq : meanforceapprox ] ) much more than the precise locations where the centers are deposited . an important practical consequence is that it is rather straightforward to pick the parameters @xmath59 and @xmath61 in  ( [ eq : tamd ] ) since the final result is robust against variations in these parameters .    ) by forward euler with a time -

dimensional example for which @xmath81 and @xmath82 where @xmath5 is the mueller potential  @xcite . in this case , there is no need to extend the system as in  ( [ eq : tamd ] ) , and the temperature accelerated dynamics simply reduces to ( setting @xmath83 by appropriate rescaling of time ) @xmath84 fig . [ fig:1 ] shows a tamd trajectory generated by solving  ( [ eq : tamdex ] ) by forward euler with the initial condition @xmath85 and a time - step of @xmath86 for @xmath75 time - steps at @xmath87 ( for comparison the energy barrier between the two main minima of the mueller potential is about @xmath88 ) . also shown are the centers @xmath89 obtained by depositing a new center along the trajectory each time the trajectory reaches a point which is @xmath79 away for all the previous centers . in this run , @xmath80 centers were deposited . at the centers , we used @xmath90 as estimate of the `` mean force '' ( i.e. there is no sampling error in the present example ) . we then used these data to reconstruct the free energy as explained in sec . [ sec : reconstruct ] . [ fig : muelsweepres ] shows the residual per center @xmath49 defined in  ( [ eq : resid ] ) . the optimal @xmath27 for this run was @xmath91 and the condition number at this @xmath44 was @xmath92 . the level sets of the reconstructed potential are shown in fig . [ fig:2 ] and compared to those of the original mueller potential , while fig . [ fig : muelsweeptrj1 ] compares the values of the original and reconstructed mueller potential along the tamd trajectory shown in fig . [ fig:1 ] . as a simple estimate of the error , we used : @xmath93 where @xmath94 denotes the reconstructed potential and @xmath95 is the domain in which the original potential remains less than @xmath96 above its minimum value . the error defined in  ( [ eq : error1 ] ) for this calculation was @xmath97 . these results , which are already very good , can be improved by diminishing @xmath67 and thereby increasing the number of centers without having to increase the length of the tamd trajectory . for example , by taking @xmath98 , we obtained @xmath99 centers in a trajectory still @xmath100 steps long . using these centers to reconstruct the mueller potential , we obtained @xmath101 . the level sets of the reconstructed and original potential defined in fig . [ fig:2 ] now overimposed so perfectly that they could not be distinguished on the scale of fig . [ fig:2 ] ( data not shown ) . the optimal @xmath27 for this calculation was @xmath102 , at which value the residual was @xmath103 and the condition number was @xmath104 . finally , we note that the result can also by improved by keeping the same distance @xmath98 between centers but increasing the length of the tamd trajectory . for instance , increasing the number of steps to @xmath105 produced a reconstruction with an error @xmath106 ( data not shown ) . defined in  ( [ eq : resid ] ) for the reconstruction of the mueller potential with the @xmath107 steps single - sweep trajectory shown in fig . [ fig:1 ] . the optimal @xmath27 for this run was @xmath91.,width=312 ]    ) ( black curve ) . here we use the @xmath80 centers shown in fig . [ fig:1 ] . the optimal @xmath27 is @xmath91 , see fig . [ fig : muelsweepres ] . we show 29 level sets evenly distributed between @xmath77 and @xmath78 . the level sets of the reconstructed potential and the original one are in so close agreement that they can only be distinguished in some localized regions ( e.g. near the saddle point between the two minima in the lower right corner ) . , width=312 ] because metadynamics  @xcite also uses an extended dynamical system for @xmath2 and @xmath12 and the gaussian packet  ( [ eq : kernel ] ) to represent @xmath7 , the single - sweep method bears similarities with it . yet , there is an essential difference between the two methods . unlike the single - sweep method , metadynamics does not use the mean force , and estimates @xmath7 by direct sampling , which turns out to be a less efficient way to proceed . let us elaborate on this claim . recall that metadynamics uses an extended system like  ( [ eq : tamd ] ) but where the equation for @xmath12 is replaced by  @xcite @xmath108 here @xmath6 is now the physical temperature of the system , and @xmath59 and @xmath61 are parameters playing the same role as in  ( [ eq : tamd ] ) . the integral term in  ( [ eq : zzmeta ] ) is a flooding term ( with @xmath109 controlling the flooding rate ) which deposits gaussian packets  @xmath110 on the energy landscape wherever @xmath62 goes , thereby progressively leveling the effective free energy landscape felt by  @xmath62 . the negative of the integral of the gaussian packets deposited then gives an approximation of the free energy . for a trajectory with @xmath111 time - steps of size  @xmath112 , the time - discretized approximation of this integral reads ( compare  ( [ eq : radialbasis ] ) ) @xmath113 where @xmath18 is a constant used to adjust the height of @xmath19 . steps single - sweep trajectory shown in fig . [ fig:1 ] . the green line shows the absolute value of the difference between the two.,width=312 ]    despite the fact that  ( [ eq : freemeta ] ) uses gaussian packets which are radial - basis functions , the representation  ( [ eq : freemeta ] ) is very different from the standard radial - basis representation  ( [ eq : radialbasis ] ) used in the single - sweep method . in particular , there are no coefficients @xmath25 to adjust in  ( [ eq : freemeta ] ) this has the important consequence that , instead of requiring a single sweep across @xmath12-space to get an accurate estimate of the free energy , metadynamics requires that the trajectory revisits many times the same locations in @xmath12-space to deposit centers ( i.e. @xmath111 in  ( [ eq : freemeta ] ) must be much larger than @xmath33 in  ( [ eq : radialbasis ] ) to achieve the same accuracy ) . this is because the leveling out achieved by the integral term in  ( [ eq : zzmeta ] ) and , hence , the convergence of the representation  ( [ eq : freemeta ] ) , only occur statistically  @xcite ( in contrast , the mean force data used at each center in the single sweep method contains already all the statistical information needed at that center ) . this is consistent with metadynamics being in essence an histogram method , albeit one where the histogram windows are adjusted on - the - fly . steps overimposed on the original mueller potential.,width=312 ]    what this entails in terms of efficiency can be illustrated on the two - dimensional mueller example considered before . in this example , to generate the metadynamics trajectory we used  ( [ eq : tamdex ] ) with flooding terms added as in  ( [ eq : zzmeta ] ) , consistent with what was done in ref . @xcite to test the efficiency of metadynamics in a similar set - up . [ fig : muelmetaxy ] shows the metadynamics trajectory obtained by integrating  ( [ eq : zzmeta ] ) for @xmath75 timesteps with a time - step of @xmath114 ( same as in the single - sweep method for the results shown in figs . [ fig:1 ] to  [ fig : muelsweepres ] ) . as can be seen in fig . [ fig : muelmetaxy ] , this number of timesteps was enough for the trajectory to visit the important regions of the potential . the reconstructed free energy from this calculation is compared in fig . [ fig:6 ] to the original one . the metadynamics result is also compared in fig .  [ fig:6b ] to the one obtained by the single - sweep method with @xmath80 centers . the error  ( [ eq : error1 ] ) for this metadynamics calculation was @xmath115 , i.e. almost two orders of magnitude higher than with the single - sweep method . [ fig : muelmetatrj1 ] shows the original and reconstructed mueller potential along the metadynamics trajectory ( blue and red lines , respectively ) , together with the absolute value of their difference ( green line ) . by comparing figs . [ fig : muelsweeptrj1 ] and  [ fig : muelmetatrj1 ] , it can be seen that the discrepancy between the original and reconstructed potential is much larger with metadynamics than with the single - sweep method on trajectories of the same length . note that these results clearly indicates that it is not sufficient that the metadynamics trajectory visits once a region on phase space to get an accurate representation of the free energy in this region . this was already noted in refs . @xcite . steps with a time - step of @xmath74 ( same as in figs.[fig:1 ] and  [ fig:2 ] ) . we only use 10 level sets evenly distributed between @xmath77 and @xmath78 because the differences between the maps are much bigger than with the single - sweep method and drawing more level sets makes the figure difficult to read . ( there are only seven black level sets in the energy reconstructed by metadynamics because it levels off around @xmath116.),width=312 ]     steps and a time - step of @xmath74 . other representation of these contourplots were already shown in figs . [ fig:2 ] and  [ fig:6 ] respectively . the map reconstructed by the single - sweep method is very close to the map of the original mueller potential . the colormaps used in both panels are the same and the reconstructed potentials are shifted so that their minimum is @xmath77 ; the white region in the left panel is where the energy is above @xmath96 and is not shown ( the result of metadynamics shown in the right panel levels off around @xmath116 which is why there is no white).,width=312 ]     steps and a time - step of @xmath74 . other representation of these contourplots were already shown in figs . [ fig:2 ] and  [ fig:6 ] respectively . the map reconstructed by the single - sweep method is very close to the map of the original mueller potential . the colormaps used in both panels are the same and the reconstructed potentials are shifted so that their minimum is @xmath77 ; the white region in the left panel is where the energy is above @xmath96 and is not shown ( the result of metadynamics shown in the right panel levels off around @xmath116 which is why there is no white).,width=312 ]    we were able to improve the metadynamics result by extending the simulation to @xmath117 steps . the covering of the important regions in the potential was now extensive ( data not shown ) , and the reconstructed potential ( data not shown ) looked visually better than the one obtained with the shorter trajectory . yet the error  ( [ eq : error1 ] ) was @xmath118 , i.e. still two orders of magnitude larger than the highest error we obtained with the single - sweep method using a 10 times shorter trajectory . we did not attempt to go to longer runs with metadynamics because the memory term in  ( [ eq : zzmeta ] ) makes such simulations increasingly expensive ( their cost scales as the square of the number of timesteps ) . it should also be stressed that in all these calculations , we optimized the parameters @xmath119 , @xmath27 and @xmath6 the best we could . this optimization , however , turns out to be complicated since there is no systematic way to perform it because , unlike with the single - sweep method , there is no objective function to minimize in metadynamics . the results shown in figs .  [ fig : muelmetaxy][fig : muelmetatrj1 ] were obtained with @xmath120 , @xmath121 and @xmath122 .    to be fair , we should conclude this comparison by mentioning that the simplicity of the mueller potential example tends to exaggerate the gain that the single sweep method provides over metadynamics . indeed , in realistic situations , the single - sweep method also requires to compute the mean force via  ( [ eq : meanforceapprox ] ) , an operation which was unnecessary in the mueller example since the force was readily available . computing the mean force adds an extra cost to the method . it is worth stressing again , however , that the computation of the time averages in  ( [ eq : meanforceapprox ] ) can be distributed over several processors . this means that in the ideal situation where the user has at least one processor per center , the effective time to compute all of the mean forces is the same as the one for computing a single one of these forces , i.e. we have perfect scalability . metadynamics can be parallelized per replica as well , as was proposed in refs . @xcite , but not as straightforwardly and not with perfect scalability . indeed , in all of these versions of metadynamics , the simulated replica are never completely independent from each other . steps metadynamics shown in fig . [ fig : muelmetaxy ] . the green line shows the absolute value of the difference between the two . the green line here should be compared with the one in fig . [ fig : muelsweeptrj1 ] for the single - sweep method : the discrepancy between the original and reconstructed potential is always larger with metadynamics than with the single - sweep method.,width=312 ] in this section , we use the single - sweep method to reconstruct the free energy of the solvated alanine dipeptide ( ad ) molecule in two and four torsion angles at @xmath123  k. while ad is not an example of biochemical interest _ per  se _ , we study it because it has been extensively used as a benchmark example for free energy calculations in the literature  @xcite . on top of this the system is simple enough that we can use it to systematically investigate how the accuracy of the reconstruction method depends on the number of centers and how robust the method is with respect to statistical errors in the input data for the mean forces . another question we investigate in this section is the robustness of the method against the choice of radial - basis functions . specifically , we compare results obtained using the gaussian packet  ( [ eq : kernel ] ) and the wendland function @xmath124 where @xmath125 if @xmath126 , and @xmath127 otherwise . ( [ eq : wend ] ) is another well - known example of radial - basis function which has the pleasant property that it is compactly supported . this property is appealing in the calculations since it limits the range over which centers interact in  ( [ eq : objective ] ) . all md simulations reported below were performed with a version of the moil code  @xcite suitably modified by us , and the amber / opls  @xcite force field ( for details of the md set - up see appendix  [ sec : md ] ) . we use the standard dihedral angles @xmath128 and @xmath129 . at  @xmath123  k , the system is confined in a region of the @xmath130 space with @xmath131 by energy barriers higher than @xmath6 . in order to overcome these barriers and sweep through the whole @xmath132 ^ 2 $ ] space , we generated a trajectory by using  ( [ eq : tamd ] ) with @xmath133 , @xmath134  kcal / mol / rad@xmath135 , a friction coefficient @xmath136  kcal@xmath137ps / mol / rad@xmath135 and an artificial temperature @xmath138  kcal / mol . with this choice of the parameters , the important regions of the @xmath132 ^ 2 $ ] space were visited in @xmath139 steps ( @xmath140  ps in the time units of the md variables ) . the time series of @xmath128 and @xmath129 along this trajectory are shown in fig . [ fig : adtrj ] . variations in @xmath59 , @xmath61 and @xmath141 led to qualitatively similar tamd trajectories , indicating that the the method is robust with regard to the choice of these parameters . sets with a different number  @xmath33 of centers were deposited along the tamd trajectory afterwards by processing this trajectory using various distances  @xmath67 between the centers . specifically , we generated sets of @xmath142 , @xmath143 , @xmath144 , @xmath145 , @xmath146 and @xmath147 centers using , respectively , @xmath148 , @xmath149 , @xmath150 , @xmath151 , @xmath152 , @xmath153 .     and @xmath129 along the @xmath140  ps long tamd trajectory for the solvated alanine dipeptide ( ad ) . , width=312 ] given a set of @xmath33 centers @xmath154 , we computed the mean forces via @xmath33 independent md simulations with restraints at @xmath155 , i.e. by simulating  ( [ eq : tamd2 ] ) in the isokinetic ensemble at @xmath123  k , and estimated the mean force via  ( [ eq : meanforceapprox ] ) with @xmath156  kcal / mol / rad@xmath135 . this value of @xmath157 was high enough since we checked that the reconstructed free energy remained invariant with higher values of  @xmath157 ( we did so up to @xmath158  kcal / mol / rad@xmath135 ) . we then used this data in the reconstruction procedure explained in sec . [ sec : reconstruct ] . note that since the free energy in the @xmath130 angle is periodic , we have to periodically extend the centers for the representation . this amounts to changing the representation in  ( [ eq : radialbasis ] ) into @xmath159 where @xmath160 is the unit vector in @xmath21 . in practice , only few periodic replica of the centers are needed ( i.e. @xmath161 for @xmath162 ) because the radial - basis functions centered at the centers further away from the cell under consideration make negligible contributions to the result in this cell . we first detail our result with this choice of parameters to pick an example which led to a good balance between accuracy and efficiency . other choices of parameters are discussed below . thus , fig . [ fig:7 ] shows the reconstructed free energy map obtained with @xmath163 ( @xmath145 centers ) and by computing the mean forces from  ( [ eq : meanforceapprox ] ) with @xmath164  ps . the optimal @xmath27 in this calculation was @xmath165 . in the figure , the minimum of the free energy is set at @xmath166  kcal / mol , and contour levels are plotted at @xmath167  kcal / mol , @xmath168  kcal / mol and then every @xmath168  kcal / mol . the centers are represented as white circles , and the mean forces at the centers as arrows .     and @xmath129 dihedral angles at @xmath123  k calculated with the single - sweep method by using @xmath145 centers deposited at a distance of @xmath163 from each other . units for the free energy are kcal / mol , and contour levels are plotted at @xmath167  kcal / mol , @xmath168  kcal / mol , and then every @xmath168  kcal / mol . the optimal @xmath27 in this reconstruction was @xmath169 . the centers are represented as white circles . at every center , the corresponding mean force vector is also shown . mean forces were calculated by using  ( [ eq : meanforceapprox ] ) with @xmath156  kcal / mol / rad@xmath135 and @xmath164  ps.,width=312 ]    since the free energy map depends on the force field used , comparison with results in the literature is difficult . to assess the accuracy of our result self - consistently , we compared it with the free energy calculated by computing the pdf of @xmath128 and @xmath129 from a direct md simulation ( dmds ) of about @xmath170  ns . while this trajectory does not cover all the @xmath132 ^ 2 $ ] space , it covers the important regions and allows for an unbiased estimation of the free energy in these regions which can be used as benchmark . the left panel in fig . [ fig:8 ] shows the contour levels of the free energy from the single - sweep ( black lines ) and that from dmds ( red lines ) . the contour levels are plotted at @xmath171  kcal / mol ( dotted lines ) , every @xmath167  kcal / mol from @xmath167 to @xmath172  kcal / mol , and then every @xmath173  kcal / mol . as can be seen , single - sweep results agree remarkably well with those of the dmds .    in terms of cost , to generate the result shown in fig . [ fig:7 ] , we had to make one simulation run of @xmath140  ps to generate the tamd trajectory , plus @xmath145 independent runs of @xmath174  ps distributed on different nodes ( the additional cost of estimating the parameters @xmath35 and @xmath44 to use in  ( [ eq : radialbasis ] ) is insignificant ) . this makes for a total of @xmath175  ns of absolute simulation time . however , after distribution , the effective simulation time needed is only @xmath142  ps . on top of this , we show below that a good estimate of the free energy can be obtained with as low as 90 centers ( i.e. with an absolute simulation time of @xmath176  ns and the same effective simulation time ,  @xmath142  ps ) . for comparison , in ref . @xcite ensing  _ et al . _ report a @xmath172  ns calculation performed with metadynamics to estimate the free energy of ad in @xmath128 and @xmath129 . it is not clear how well this metadynamics calculation can be parallelized to reduce its effective cost ( it was not parallelized in ref . in addition , the result of this metadynamics calculation is unlikely to be as accurate as the one in fig .

[ fig:7 ] , but it is more accurate . the residual error can be estimated from the right panel of fig . [ fig:8 ] which shows the contour levels of the free energy from the single - sweep ( black lines ) and that from dmds ( red lines ) : these level sets coincide up to statistical errors in the dmds , indicating that the free energy provided by the single sweep method with @xmath147 centers and @xmath179  ps can indeed be taken as an `` exact '' benchmark . and @xmath129 reconstructed with gaussian functions using @xmath147 centers and @xmath179  ps . the figures in the different panels correspond to various number of centers and length of time averaging for the mean forces , as indicated . units are kcal / mol . note that the scale of the colormap is different from the one in fig .

[ fig : resad ] shows the residual per center versus the number of centers for ad , by using gaussian ( filled symbols ) and wendland ( empty symbols ) basis functions , using @xmath164  ps ( diamonds ) and @xmath179  ps ( circles ) long restrained simulations to estimate the mean forces . at equal values of @xmath33 and @xmath181 , the reconstruction is slightly more accurate with gaussian than with wendland functions , though these differences turn out to be quite small in terms of the free energy maps themseves ( data not shown ) .     and @xmath129 angles . data are from calculations with different time averaging length , using gaussian ( g ) and wendland ( w ) basis functions.,width=312 ]    using longer simulations for the mean force ( which means a smaller random error on these forces ) also improves the results . with @xmath147 centers and @xmath179  ps long simulations for the mean forces , the maps reconstructed with gaussian and wendland basis functions were almost identical ( data not shown ) , and they were not significantly different from the map shown in fig . [ fig:7 ] . these results , however , were obtained at very different values of optimal  @xmath27 : @xmath182 with gaussians and @xmath183 with wendland functions . the condition numbers at the optimal @xmath27 were @xmath184 and @xmath185 , respectively , which is low . note that the same trends here described were observed in a periodic test case for which the potential was known exactly ( data not shown ) .      as a second more challenging test , we computed the free energy of ad in the four torsion angles , @xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath186 , and  @xmath187 . a tamd trajectory of @xmath188  ps was generated by using  ( [ eq : tamd ] ) with @xmath189 , @xmath134  kcal / mol / rad@xmath135 , an artificial temperature @xmath190  kcal / mol , friction coefficients @xmath136  kcal@xmath137ps / mol / rad@xmath135 for @xmath128 and @xmath129 and @xmath83  kcal@xmath137ps / mol / rad@xmath135 for @xmath186 and @xmath187 . the md potential keeps the amide planes in _ trans _ configuration , and so @xmath186 and @xmath187 were varying in the range @xmath191 $ ] . in @xmath188 ps , the tamd trajectory covered well the accessible state space for @xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath186 and @xmath187 , in the sense that the time series for these angles were similar in their respective state space to those shown in fig . [ fig : adtrj ] ( notice however that extensive coverage of the four - dimensional space is unlikely in so short a run ) . along the tamd trajectory , @xmath192 centers at a distance of @xmath193 were deposited . at these centers , the mean forces @xmath40 were computed by using  ( [ eq : meanforceapprox ] ) with @xmath156  kcal / mol / rad@xmath135 and @xmath164  ps ( i.e. the absolute time of simulation was about @xmath194  ns , but the effective time after distribution was @xmath195  ps only ) . we used these @xmath40 in the objective function  ( [ eq : objective ] ) to finally get the representation  ( [ eq : radialbasis ] ) of the four - dimensional free energy  @xmath196 . the optimal @xmath27 in this representation was @xmath197 and the condition number at this value of @xmath27 was @xmath198 .    , @xmath129 , @xmath186 angles obtained from the marginal in these angles of the pdf associated with the free energy in four angles @xmath196 . data are represented for @xmath199 $ ] . note that the scale of the colormap is different from the one in fig .

"vibrationally resolved electronic spectra ( _ e.g. _ one - photon absorption and emission spectra ) are within the born - oppenheimer framework usually interpreted in terms of franck - condon ( fc ) factors ( fcfs ) @xcite . accordingly , one can try to obtain the shape of the spectral profile for a fc - allowed transition from computed fcfs in frequency domain . however , the evaluation of fcfs for large molecular systems is challenging even within the harmonic approximation if one has to take duschinsky mode mixing ( rotation )  @xcite into account . this is because multi - variate hermite polynomials have then to be evaluated for each fc integral , rather than only uni - variate hermite polynomials as is the case for the comparatively simple parallel harmonic oscillator model . the computational task becomes more difficult as the molecular size and temperature increases because the number of fc integrals grows vastly . to describe fc - forbidden or weakly allowed transitions , one has to go beyond the condon approximation and employ for instance a herzberg - teller ( ht ) expansion  @xcite of the electronic transition moment with respect to the normal coordinates . as a result , the calculation of the vibronic spectrum for a non - condon process is even more difficult than for a fc - allowed transition because one has to evaluate many matrix elements of the non - condon operators which require for each ht integral in general the calculation of combinations of several fc integrals . the number of fc integrals and matrix elements of non - condon operators to be evaluated in a sum - over - states approach can be significantly reduced with the help of rigorous integral prescreening strategies  @xcite . however , this time - independent ( ti ) calculation of the spectral profile in frequency domain is still considerably more expensive than an alternative time - dependent ( td ) approach that exploits time - correlation functions ( tcfs ) ( see _ e.g. _ ref . @xcite ) , but offers the ability to directly assign individual peaks in the spectrum . as we have outlined earlier  @xcite , a unified coherent state - based generating function ( csgf ) approach  @xcite can be used both for rigorous integral prescreening strategies and tcf calculations which combine the strengths of both approaches and complement each other favourably . even in the less demanding td approach , however , one usually has to invest significant computational time for often unnecessary spectral details . cumulants ( or moments ) of a distribution ( see _ e.g. _ refs . @xcite ) can deliver highly useful information . from this one can either attempt to reconstruct the spectral shape or try to estimate the relevant spectral profile , which can be exploited in subsequent ti and td approaches  @xcite . cumulants of the vibronic spectrum can be obtained from the csgf directly without computing the total spectrum in frequency domain . this method was exploited already in ref . @xcite for fc - allowed transitions , and we report herein an extension of this method to incorporate non - condon transitions . as application , we present the profile of the @xmath1 transition of benzene , which is in the electric dipole approximation franck - condon forbidden , at various temperatures within the linear ht approximation and compare the cumulant expansion result with the tcf approach . the spectral profile ( @xmath2 ) can be expressed via the fourier transform ( ft ) of the tcf ( @xmath3 ) that depends on the time @xmath4 and temperature @xmath5 , namely @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the transition energy and @xmath8 the @xmath9 transition energy . the corresponding occupancy representation for the tcf can be obtained from fermi s golden rule , _ i.e. _ @xmath10 where we have assumed an electric dipole transition with the electronic transition dipole moment ( @xmath11 ) , which is a function of normal coordinates of the initial electronic state . the @xmath12-dimensional harmonic oscillator eigenstates of the initial and final electronic state are denoted by @xmath13 and @xmath14 with the corresponding harmonic energy vectors @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively . the vibrational hamiltonians of the the initial and final electronic states are @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively . @xmath19 is the boltzmann constant . @xmath20 is the vibronic transition energy with respect to the @xmath9 transition energy . the time - dependent part with the vibronic transition energy corresponds to a dirac delta distribution in frequency domain and accordingly this expression is usually evaluated in frequency domain , which is straightforward . the spatial representation of the tcf in closed form can be found by evaluating the following quantum mechanical traces @xmath21 the traces can be evaluated with any complete basis . in our work coherent states were used ( see _ e.g. _ refs . @xcite ) with the duschinsky relation between initial and final state normal coordinates ( @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the duschinsky rotation matrix and displacement vector , respectively and @xmath25 are the normal coordinates of the final state ) and the ht expansion of the electronic transition dipole moment ( @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the first derivative of @xmath28 with respect to @xmath29 . ) . the vibronic spectral density function can be related to a probability density function ( pdf ) because the vibronic transition process follows a certain pdf . if all cumulants or moments of a pdf are defined and available , the pdf can be reconstructed as follows @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the @xmath32-th order cumulant at temperature @xmath5 . the cumulants of the spectral density function are normalised to give the total intensity @xmath33 . moments ( cumulants and moments are inter - convertible ) can be obtained by partial derivatives of @xmath34 with respect to time , @xmath35 thus , cumulants can be evaluated analytically or numerically by evaluating partial derivatives of @xmath34 in eq .   with respect to the time variable at @xmath36 . analytic evaluation of the cumulants to arbitrary order within the linear ht approximation can be performed along the lines of the development in refs . @xcite for the cumulants of fc profiles to arbitrary order . for numerical evaluation of low - order cumulants one needs to compute @xmath34 only at the first few time steps . to obtain the corresponding moments numerically , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are used for the calculation of even and odd moments , respectively , because @xmath39 in eq . ( see _ e.g. _ ref . @xcite ) .    the closed form of @xmath40 within the linear ht approximation can be found in ref . therein , additional flexibility was introduced to the gf by distinguishing individual vibrational modes to allow for rigorous prescreening strategies and detailed control of the dynamics . this can be done by assigning different time and temperature variables to each vibrational degrees of freedom . the corresponding gf in an occupancy representation reads as follows @xmath41 \mathrm{e}^{-({\underline{v}}^{\mathrm{t}}{\mathbf{b}}{\underline{\epsilon } }                + { \underline{v}}'^{\mathrm{t}}{\mathbf{b}}'{\underline{\epsilon } } ' ) } \ , , \label{eq : occfg}\end{aligned}\ ] ] where the general operators @xmath42 and @xmath43 , which can be products of momentum and position operators , are given instead of @xmath44 . the time variables are assigned to the matrices @xmath45 = @xmath46 and @xmath47 = @xmath48 for initial and final vibrational modes , respectively . different temperatures can be given to the initial and final vibrational degrees of freedom via @xmath49 = @xmath50 and @xmath51 = @xmath52 , respectively . @xmath53 is the corresponding normalising factor . the electronic @xmath0 transition of benzene is fc - forbidden in the electric dipole approximation ( @xmath54 ) such that only the ht terms contribute to the spectral density function . the corresponding tcf is given as follows , here with same time and temperature ( @xmath4,@xmath5 ) for all vibrational degrees of freedom , @xmath55 a time increment of 0.51  fs and a grid with 2@xmath56 grid points are used for the corresponding fft calculations . the experimental uv absorption spectrum of fischer  @xcite is additionally shown in read . right part of the figure : the dashed lines are drawn for the tcf - fft approach with a gaussian line shape function of with fwhm of 500  @xmath57 . a time increment of 0.10  fs and a grid with 2@xmath58 grid points are used for the corresponding fft calculations . solid lines are drawn for the curve obtained by edgeworth expansion using up to 4-th order cumulants and , for 1000  k by edgeworth expansion using up to 8-th order cumulants . , scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the vibronic profiles for benzene s @xmath0 transition at zero kelvin and finite temperatures are calculated with two methods , namely tcf and time - independent cumulant expansion ( ce ) . we use herein the term time - independent ce , which was employed in ref . @xcite , to distinguish this ce from the conventional ( time - dependent ) ce ( see _ e.g. _ refs . @xcite ) which involves time integration for the cumulant calculation . the spectra obtained are displayed in fig . [ fig : benzenespectrum ] . to compute the vibronic spectra via the tcf method , the fftw library  @xcite is used for fast fourier transform ( fft ) . the approximate curves are generated for the ce with edgeworth expansion  @xcite using the computed low - order cumulants . some of the problems related to this type of expansion for the description of fc profiles are discussed in ref . @xcite . the moments ( eq .  [ eq : moments ] ) are calculated both analytically and numerically , the latter by taking partial derivatives of @xmath34 in eq . [ eq : closedform ] with respect to time . analytical and numerical results are compared in table  [ table : moments ] . required input data from electronic structure calculations for benzene , _ i.e. _ molecular equilibrium structures and corresponding harmonic force fields for each electronic state ( @xmath59 and @xmath60 ) as well as first derivatives of the electronic transition dipole moments are taken from ref . @xcite ( casscf / dzv ) . these data have recently been compared to results obtained via analytical derivatives techniques for electronic transition dipole moments within a time - dependent density functional theory framework  @xcite . the vibronic structure methods employed in the present work are implemented in a development version of our vibronic structure program package hotfcht  @xcite .    the left hand side in fig . [ fig : benzenespectrum ] shows vibronic profiles from tcf - fft which are convoluted by a lorentzian line shape function with full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of 50  @xmath57 at temperatures elevating from 0  k to 1000  k. this fc - forbidden vibronic transition is mediated by the non - totally symmetric vibrational modes in the irreducible representation e@xmath61 . the main feature of the vibronic spectrum is from progressions in the totally symmetric c - c stretching mode ( 963 @xmath57 ) building on the so - called false origin from a single excitation of a non - totally symmetric ( e@xmath61 ) in - plane bending mode ( 575 @xmath57 ) as indicated in the spectrum at zero kelvin . the calculated spectrum at 300 k is compared with the experimental data of fischer  @xcite . the two spectra agree fairly well in the low energy region but the computed peaks at higher energies are slightly shifted to larger wavenumbers due to the harmonic approximation . as temperature increases the vibrational structure becomes very congested and washed out . at 1000 k ( only employed for testing the method ) one can not see a resolved vibrational structure any longer , only the corresponding envelope .    on the right hand side of fig . [ fig : benzenespectrum ] the two methods ( tcf - fft and ce - edgeworth ) are compared for increasing temperatures . the spectra are convoluted in the tcf - fft curves ( dashed lines ) with a gaussian line shape function of 500  @xmath57 for fwhm . the second moments ( 4.51@xmath6210@xmath63 @xmath64 ) of the gaussian line shape function is added to the second moments of the vibronic spectrum to take the line shape function into account ( see ref . @xcite for the rationalisation and details ) . the relatively broad line shape function is used for the tcf - fft curves to have vibrationally relatively structureless spectra for comparison . at 0 , 300 and 500 k , the tcf - fft curves still show vibrational structure and the ce - edgeworth curves ( solid lines ) look like nonlinear regression curves of the corresponding tcf - fft spectra . when the vibrational structures are also essentially smoothed out in the tcf - fft curves at 1000 k , the two approaches agree with each other extremely well . up to the 4-th order cumulants are used for 0 , 300 , 500 k and up to 8-th order cumulants are computed for 1000 k.    in table  [ table : moments ] the moments computed numerically ( via derivatives ) and analytical are compared . at low orders and all temperatures the two methods agree well and for higher orders still the agreement is satisfactory . one of the advantages of the numerical method is that one only needs to compute the tcf for the first few time steps . the analytical method usually meets a combinatorial problem in high order cumulant calculations due to the analytic derivatives of the inverse matrix . the second advantage is that it is easy to include linear and nonlinear non - condon effects . the third advantage is that one can incorporate general line shape functions which would not have well defined cumulants ( see the discussion on page 415 of ref . @xcite ) . mean excitation wavenumbers are computed for the ht active @xmath65 symmetric vibrational modes of the final state . the mean excitation energy can serve as a parameter for the individual vibrational degrees of freedom as an effective reorganisation energy or a huang ( when normalised by its harmonic energy ) , which can be characterised as a function of structural deformation , frequency change , duschinsky mode coupling and temperature both in the condon and non - condon approximation . one might naively expect a larger mean excitation energy as the temperature increases but the mean values of high frequency modes ( 1665 and 3389 @xmath57 ) in some intermediate temperature rages are smaller than at zero kelvin . this can be rationalised as follows : because the duschinsky mode mixing between low and high frequency modes is small in the present case , the high frequency modes can not obtain thermal energy from the low frequency modes efficiently . thus the high frequency modes are almost thermally inactive , whereas the total intensity ( @xmath66 ) increases as temperature increases . in the mean energy calculation of the high frequency modes at finite temperatures the denominator ( total intensity ) increases because low frequency modes accept thermal energy while the numerator ( excitation of high frequency modes ) stays constant . therefore the mean excitation energies of high frequency modes are reduced at finite temperatures . if duschinsky rotation couples the low and high frequency modes significantly ( see _ e.g. _ ref . @xcite ) , however , thermal energy can be transfered to the high frequency modes via the low frequency modes in the initial state , accordingly the mean excitation energies of high frequency modes can increase as temperature increases . we have discussed a cumulant expansion method for describing non - condon transitions and applied it to the prototypical one - photon electric dipole @xmath0 transition of benzene , which is fc forbidden but ht allowed in the linear ht approximation . the method is particularly powerful when one does not require all the details of the vibronic structures , but rather only quantities such as peak maximum , mean and variance of the spectral shape . this method is computationally much cheaper than the sum - over - states and time - correlation function approach . moreover , the information ( _ e.g. _ relevant energy window ) from the cumulant expansion method can be used in the calculation within the other two methods . herein we compared a numerical approach for the calculation of cumulants with the results from an analytical scheme . the results obtained numerically are still fairly good . with this method , one can incorporate easily nonlinear non - condon terms and various line shape functions . in the time - correlation function calculation the real part and imaginary part at each time step provide automatically the even and odd moments , respectively . in the first few time steps we already have the first few moments available and the probability distribution function ( information ) becomes complete as time progresses . financial support by the beilstein - institut , frankfurt / main , and computer time provided by the center for scientific computing ( csc ) frankfurt are gratefully acknowledged . we are indebted to jason stuber for discussions . 26ifxundefined [ 1 ] ifx#1 ifnum [ 1 ] # 1firstoftwo secondoftwo ifx [ 1 ] # 1firstoftwo secondoftwo `` `` # 1''''@noop [ 0]secondoftwosanitize@url [ 0 ] + 12$12  & 12#1212_12%12@startlink[1]@endlink[0]@bib@innerbibempty @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop   ( ) @noop   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop _ _  ( , ,  ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop _ _  ( ,  ,  ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop   ( ) @noop * * ( ) @noop _ _ ( ,  , ) @noop * * ,   ( ) ,   @noop * * , ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ,   ( ) @noop * * ( ) @noop   ( )","The text discusses the vibronic spectra of a molecule, specifically benzene, using the Franck-Condon (FC) approximation.

"the interaction of ultraintense lasers with jets of molecular clusters or nanodroplets ( with typical size in the range @xmath0 nm and containing @xmath1 particles ) is a central research topic @xcite , with important applications , such as tabletop nuclear fusion for compact neutron sources @xcite , or the laboratory investigations of nucleosynthesis reactions , relevant to astrophysical scenarios @xcite . clustered media can be regarded as sparse distributions of tiny solid targets , a peculiar configuration that allows for both a deep penetration of the laser radiation and a strong laser - matter coupling with many individual , overdense targets , thus providing extremely efficient energy absorption @xcite . when hit by an ultraintense laser beam , the neutral atoms in a cluster are promptly ionized ( cf . ref . @xcite for a detailed analysis of the concurring ionization mechanisms in different laser / cluster configurations ) and a dense `` nanoplasma '' @xcite is formed . the free electrons then absorb energy from the laser pulse @xcite and start expanding , causing the formation of strong electric fields , which lead to efficient ion acceleration , as first predicted by dawson @xcite . when the energy transferred to the electrons is much smaller than the electrostatic energy stored in the ion core , charge separation is localized to regions much smaller than the cluster @xcite , which then remains quasi - neutral and undergoes a hydrodynamic - like expansion @xcite ; in opposite conditions ( e.g. with small deuterium clusters exposed to extremely intense laser radiation ) the electrons suddenly escape from the cluster and the remaining bare - ion distribution undergoes a pure coulomb explosion ( ce ) @xcite . in intermediate situations , the expansion dynamics is a mixture of the phenomenology of the two limits , with the expansion process being strongly dependent on the self - consistent dynamics of ions and trapped electrons @xcite . when increasing the laser energy , or when lowering the cluster size and density , the expansion conditions vary smoothly from quasi - neutral , hydrodynamic - like regimes to pure ce regimes , as confirmed by particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations @xcite of the self - consistent laser - cluster interaction and by kinetic or fluid modeling of the expansion of finite - size , non - quasi - neutral plasma expansions @xcite . therefore , the expansion regime can be controlled by regulating the amount of energy transferred to the electrons @xcite , which can be obtained with appropriately shaped laser beams . an important example is the irradiation of homonuclear deuterium clusters with two sequential laser pulses having different intensities @xcite . in this way , one can taylor the expansion dynamics so as to induce overrunning between ions and the consequent formation of expanding shells containing multiple ion flows . within such structures ( here denoted as `` shock shells '' , following the terminology in @xcite ) , the relative velocities between deuterium ions from different flows can be sufficiently high for energetic collisions and _ dd _ fusion reactions to occurr @xcite . since these intracluster reactions occur early in the expansion , and before different exploding clusters overlap , they are expected to produce a time resolved burst of fusion neutrons before the bulk neutron signal due to intercluster reactions @xcite . in the case of heteronuclear clusters , e.g. deuterium - tritium clusters , ion species having different charge - to - mass ratios expand with different velocities making intracluster , interspecies reactions possible also with standard single - pulse irradiation @xcite . this paper provides an organic review of the work on controlled expansions of clusters and nanoplasmas published in @xcite , complemented with novel simulation results obtained with a recently developed molecular - dynamics technique @xcite . in the following , the transition to the ce regime is analyzed with a self - consistent kinetic model ( section [ sec : expansion ] ) , the concept of shock shell is briefly reviewed ( section [ sec : shocks ] ) , and the possibility of achieving intracluster nuclear reactions in homonuclear clusters @xcite by driving a slow expansion followed by a sudden ce @xcite is explored ( section [ sec : reactions ] ) . in order to analyze the influence of the electrons on the expansion dynamics , a kinetic model for the collisionless expansion of a spherically symmetric nanoplasma has been developed @xcite , based on the assumptions that the electrons are nonrelativistic and resorting to the large mass disparity between electrons and ions . the expansion process is divided in two stages : an initial charging transient with frozen ions , and the long term expansion of both ions and electrons . in the second stage , the expansion dynamics is described self - consistently by following the radial motion of the cold ions , while accounting for the three - dimensional dynamics of the hot electrons using a sequence of `` ergodic '' equilibrium configurations @xcite , represented by stationary solutions of the vlasov equation that depend on the total energy @xmath2 only . the electron density instantaneously in equilibrium with the electrostatic potential @xmath3 can be written as @xmath4 where @xmath5 indicates functional dependence on @xmath3 , @xmath6 is the energy distribution of the electrons , and @xmath7^{\frac{1}{2}}{\mathrm{d}r}^{\prime}$ ] is the probability density of finding an electron having total energy @xmath8 at the radial position @xmath9 . the self - consistent potential @xmath3 satisfies the nonlinear poisson equation @xmath10 $ ] . by resorting to the theory of adiabatic invariants for time varying hamiltonians @xcite , a closed set of equations is then obtained in the form @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the ion mass and charge , respectively . equations and , determining the ion trajectory @xmath14 ( @xmath15 : initial radius ) and the evolution of the electron energy @xmath16 ( @xmath17 : initial energy ) , are coupled with the nonlinear poisson equation . in eq . , the relation @xmath18 has been used , where @xmath19 is the energy distribution of the electrons resulting from the initial charging transient , a fast process that can not be described by equations the self - consistent shape of @xmath19 is determined by a virtual charging transient , in which the ions stay immobile , while an external potential barrier , initially confining the electrons , is gradually moved from @xmath20 to infinity , with a series of small radial displacements ( the validity of this procedure has been confirmed by particle - in - cell simulations @xcite and ad - hoc solutions of the vp model @xcite ) . the initial , nonequilibrium electron distribution is assumed to be a maxwellian , with temperature @xmath21 , so that the whole expansion dynamics is fully determined by the single dimensionless parameter @xmath22 ( @xmath23 : maximum ion energy attainable from the ce of a uniform ion sphere with radius @xmath20 and total charge @xmath24 ; @xmath25 : initial electron debye length ) , which accounts for both the initial electron temperature and the cluster size and density .    the positive charge buildup at the ion front , @xmath26 , and the mean kinetic energy of the trapped electrons , @xmath27 , as functions of @xmath28 , are displayed in fig . [ fig : qeq_teq ] . simple fits for @xmath26 and @xmath27 are found as @xmath29 and @xmath30 $ ] , where @xmath31 . for @xmath32 ( i.e. @xmath33 ) , the fits reduce to @xmath34 , thus recovering the theoretical results for planar expansions @xcite , and to @xmath35 .    when the initial equilibrium is reached and the ions are allowed to expand , gaining kinetic energy , the electrons cool down and the charge buildup decreases ( until a ballistic regime is reached for both species @xcite ) . depending on the value of @xmath28 , such behavior strongly affects the ion dynamics and the resulting distribution of ion energy @xcite : for @xmath36 , the spectrum is monotonic as in a ce ; for @xmath37 , it exhibits a local maximum far from the cutoff energy , thus being qualitatively different from the ce case . in this respect , the transition value @xmath38 can be considered as the lower bound for the validity of the ce approximation . the cutoff energy is fit by @xmath39 , which , for @xmath40 , reduces to @xmath41 ; for @xmath37 , the location of the maximum is fit by the power - law @xmath42 . these scaling laws , valid for any combination of @xmath20 , @xmath43 , and @xmath21 , can be useful to interpret experimental data @xcite . in the absence of electrons , the explosion dynamics of a spherical distribution of cold ions is described by equation , which reduces to @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the number of ions enclosed by a sphere of radius @xmath9 at time @xmath46 . if the initial profile of ion density is uniform and step - like ( i.e. @xmath47 for @xmath48 ) , the repulsive electric field grows linearly for @xmath49 , reaching its maximum at the outer boundary , which causes the outer ions to be always faster than the inner ones . thus , ions never overtake each other , @xmath45 is conserved along the ion trajectories ( so is the total energy of each ion ) , and the equation of motion can be integrated analytically @xcite , yielding , for ions initially at rest , the expansion velocity @xmath50^{1/2}r_0\omega{_{\mathrm{pi}}}$ ] , where @xmath51 is the initial ion plasma frequency . the radial trajectory is then given , in implicit form , by @xmath52^{1/2 } + \log[\xi{_{\mathrm{i}}}^{1/2}+(\xi{_{\mathrm{i}}}-1)^{1/2 } ] = ( 2/3)^{1/2}\omega{_{\mathrm{pi}}}t$ ] , where @xmath53 is the expansion factor . in this solution , @xmath54 is independent of @xmath15 , the @xmath55 phase - space profile is always a straight line with equation @xmath56^{1/2}\omega{_{\mathrm{pi}}}r$ ] , and the ion density maintains its step - like form , decreasing in time as @xmath57 . the asymptotic ion energy distribution is @xmath58 ( cf . [ fig : ionspectrum_t0 ] ) .    if , more realistically , nonuniform density profiles are considered , the expansion features change qualitatively @xcite : when the initial density is a decreasing function of @xmath9 , the repulsive coulomb field reaches its maximum within the ion sphere @xcite , leading to ion overtaking and to the formation of multiple - flow regions ( shock shells ) with characteristic multi - branched phase - space profile as in fig . [ fig : dp ] ( since the ion trajectories are no longer independent of one another , the above analytical solution no longer holds @xcite ) . the physical interest of these shock shells resides in the appearance of multiple flows with large relative velocities within a single exploding cluster , which can lead to energetic ion - ion collisions and to intracluster reactions in homonuclear clusters @xcite . an effective strategy to produce large - scale shock shells in a controlled fashion is combining different expansion regimes so that a slow hydrodynamic - like expansion , providing a smoothly decreasing ion - density profile , is followed by an abrupt ce . this is achievable with a double - pump irradiation scheme as in fig . [ fig : dp ] , wherein a weak pulse ( intensity : @xmath59 ; duration : @xmath60 ) is followed by a strong pulse ( intensity : @xmath61 ; duration : @xmath62 ) , with suitable time delay @xmath63 : @xmath59 must be sufficiently high to ionize the atoms , creating a nanoplasma , but not so high as to expel a significant fraction of the electrons from the cluster , whereas @xmath64 must be high enough to drive a sudden ce . in these conditions , a pronounced shock shell is formed , whose features are determined by the key double - pump parameters , namely @xmath59 and @xmath63 , which strongly affects the density profile of the cluster when being hit by the second laser . the effectiveness of the technique has been demonstrated @xcite by resorting to two- and three - dimensional pic simulations performed using the osiris 2.0 framework @xcite , closely matching realistic physical scenarios . the ability of producing multiple flows with high relative velocities within single exploding clusters makes the phenomenon attractive as a possible way to induce intracluster fusion reactions in homonuclear deuterium clusters . as pointed out in @xcite , the rates for intracluster reactions can be significantly higher than those for intercluster reactions , because the typical densities within a shock shell ( @xmath65 @xmath66 ) are higher than those within the hot plasma filament resulting from the exploded clusters ( @xmath67 @xmath66 ) . however , it is crucial to consider also that the expanding shock - shell stays appreciably dense only for a very brief time ( @xmath68 fs ) , much shorter than the typical disassembly time of the plasma filament ( @xmath69 ps ) : as shown in @xcite , the rates of intracluster reactions exhibit a sharp , time - resolved peak right after the shock - shell formation . once the expansion dynamics is known , the number of intracluster fusion reactions is obtained by summing over all possible contributions from collisions between ions belonging to different velocity branches in a shock shell ( cf . fig . [ fig : dp ] ) . the number of reactions per unit time and volume , @xmath70 , is given by @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the cross section for _ dd _ fusion , while @xmath73 and @xmath74 indicate , respectively , the ion density and velocity on the @xmath75th branch . the number of intracluster fusion reactions , @xmath76 , is obtained by integrating @xmath70 over time and space , as @xmath77 where @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 are the shock - shell boundaries and formation time , respectively . in @xcite , the influence of the double - pump parameters on @xmath76 was analyzed using a simple 1d model wherein the laser field of the first pulse gradually strips the initially neutral cluster of a part of its electrons according to a cluster barrier suppression ionization ( cbsi ) model ( cf . ref . this provided preliminary estimates for the optimal combinations of delay and intensities that maximize @xmath76 , and suggested that , for very large clusters ( @xmath81 nm ) , the intracluster reaction yield can become comparable with the intercluster neutron yield , with @xmath82 of the fusion reactions arising from intracluster collisions @xcite .    accurate calculations of the intracluster reaction yields achievable with the double - pump irradiation of homonuclear deuterium clusters are currently being performed resorting to three - dimensional molecular - dynamics simulations based on the recently developed scaled electron and ion dynamics ( seid ) technique @xcite , for different values of laser intensities , durations , and delays . preliminary results indicate that , with @xmath59 in the range @xmath83 w@xmath84 , @xmath60 in the range @xmath85 fs , @xmath86 w@xmath84 , @xmath87 fs , and @xmath63 in the range @xmath88 fs , the number of intracluster reaction per cluster can be as high as @xmath89 with a cluster size @xmath90 nm . these values are comparable with the estimate in @xcite ; furthermore , as predicted in @xcite , it is found that the optimal intensities of the first pulse are significantly lower , typically by an order of magnitude , than those estimated with the cbsi model . calculations based on the seid technique are being performed also in the case of heteronuclear deuterium - tritium clusters and nanodroplets irradiated by a single laser pulse , for either homogenous mixtures or layered targets composed by a deuterium core surrounded by a tritium shell . owing to the higher value of the deuterium - tritium fusion cross section for the energy range considered , higher number of intracluster reactions , on the order of @xmath91 , are obtained with respect to the pure - deuterium case . detailed results of these numerical simulations will be presented in a future publication @xcite . the ergodic model has been used to simulate the collisionless expansion of spherical nanoplasmas driven by energetic electrons over a wide range of values of plasma size , plasma density , and initial electron thermal energy , combined in the single dimensionless parameter @xmath28 : a qualitative change in the shape of the asymptotic energy spectrum of the ions when approaching the coulomb explosion regime has been identified and accurate fit laws for the relevant expansion features have been provided . the douple - pump irradiation technique to induce the formation of multiple ion flows during the expansion of large homonuclear deuterium clusters or nanodroplets has been described , and its applicability to produce intracluster _ dt _ fusion reactions has been proved resorting to three -

The paper ""Modified Addition Law for Energy-Momentum"" by @xcite introduced a modification to the classical addition law for energy-momentum, allowing for particles with even sub-Planckian energies to have energies exceeding the Planck energy. The modification was achieved by replacing the Planck energy @xmath123 with @xmath124 for a system of @xmath115 particles. This modification is based on postulates (iii) and (iv),","we consider an alternative approach to double special - relativistic theories . 
 the point of departure is not @xmath0-deformed algebra ( or even group - theoretical considerations ) but rather 3 physical postulates defining particle s velocity , mass , and the upper bound on its energy in terms of the respective classical quantities . for a specific definition of particle s velocity 
 we obtain magueijo - smolin ( ms ) version of the double special - relativistic theory . 
 it is shown that this version follows from the @xmath0-poincare algebra by the appropriate choice of on the shell mass , such that it is always less or equal planck s mass . 
 the @xmath0-deformed hamiltonian is found which invalidates the recent arguments about unphysical predictions of the ms transformation .    a recent research ( e.g.@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) on the so - called double special relativity not only reexamined its relation to @xmath0-deformed kinematics , but in one specific example @xcite also subjected to criticism physical predictions of one of these theoretical constructs @xcite . 
 + it should be mentioned that as early as in @xmath1 , j.lukierski with collaborators @xcite demonstrated that there exist an infinite set of transformations reducing the @xmath0-deformed casimir in majid - ruegg basis @xcite ( used in all the double - special relativistic theories , e.g.@xcite ) to the diagonal form . 
 in fact , it is possible to show that any of these transformations correspond to a different choice of what one can consider as a definition of the deformed mass . 
 this makes it difficult , without any additional assumptions , to choose a unique physical theory corresponding to the respective transformation . 
 this difficulty is emphasized @xcite by what looks like apparent non - physical predictions of one of these constructions @xcite . 
 + here we revisit the latter work @xcite , more specifically its treatment of the energy - momentum domain , this time departing not from the group - theoretical point of view , but rather from certain physically justified restrictions ( postulates ) imposed on the classically - defined physical quantities , namely energy , mass , and velocity . 
 an analogous approach was used in @xcite for a more narrowly defined goal : a study of possible definitions of @xmath0-deformed velocities and their addition laws . 
 we begin by introducing the postulates defining    \i ) the velocity of a particle ,    ii)its mass to be the same for any scale ( from classical to planck scale ) and therefore based on the relations provided by the momentum sector of classical relativity ,    iii)the existence of the upper bound ( the planck energy ) on the values of both energy and momentum . 
 we also retain the upper bound ( speed of light @xmath2 ) on a particle velocity . 
 + in what follows we use units where @xmath3 , planck constant @xmath4 , and boltzmann constant @xmath5=1 . 
 we denote the planck energy ( momentum ) by @xmath0 which in these units is equal to the inverse of the planck length @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) . 
 the classical relation between energy @xmath8 and momentum @xmath9 in these units has the following dimensionless form : @xmath10 where    @xmath11 .    and 
 @xmath12 is particle s mass . 
 + quite analogously we introduce the dimensionless expressions for the physical energy @xmath13 and momentum @xmath14 ( different from the above energy @xmath15 and momentum @xmath16 ) applicable in the region of planck - scale physics    @xmath17    following @xcite we write the general functional relation between the classical energy - momentum @xmath18 ( not physical anymore in the planck - scale phenomena ) and its planck - scale counterpart @xmath19 : @xmath20 where the functions @xmath21 and @xmath22 to be defined . 
 + to find these functions we use the above postulates ( i)-(iii ) . 
 the dimensionless velocity of a particle @xmath23 ( compatible with its classical definition in terms of the energy - momentum ) is defined as follows    @xmath24    where @xmath25 . 
 note that in this definition the velocity @xmath26 looks as the one used in the classical case , except that now this velocity @xmath27 while in the classical case    @xmath28    next we use the second postulate ( ii ) which defines particle s mass @xmath29 to be _ the same _ in _ all the regions _ ( from classical to planck scale ) , and independent of the velocity definition ( [ 3a])-([3b ] ) . 
 @xmath30    finally we require ( postulate iii ) that @xmath31 where the equality signs correspond to @xmath32 + we begin with the velocity definition according to eq . 
 ( [ 3a ] ) . upon substitution of this equation into eq.([2 ] ) we obtain @xmath33 this means that @xmath34 inserting eq.([7 ] ) into the definition of mass eq.([4 ] ) we arrive at the following differential equation : @xmath35 ^ 2=0\ ] ] its solution is : @xmath36 where the integration constant@xmath37 to be determined on the basis of the above postulates . 
 + as a result , according to eqs.([2]),([6 ] ) the energy - momentum @xmath38 is :    @xmath39    @xmath40    the value of the integration constant @xmath37 and the choice of the respective sign in the obtained solution ( [ 10a]),([10b ] ) are dictated by our postulate ( iii ) , eq . 
 ( [ 5 ] ) . 
 + to determine both , we notice that since in the classical limit @xmath41 the positive(negative ) values of @xmath15 should correspond to positive ( negative ) values of @xmath42 respectively . 
 this means the following :    @xmath43    @xmath44    taking the limit @xmath45 of eq.([11a]),(eq . [ 11b ] ) and using our postulate iii ) ( eq.[5 ] ) we get @xmath46    inserting this value of @xmath37 into eqs.([10a]),([11a]),([11b ] ) we obtain the explicit expressions for @xmath47 and @xmath42 @xmath48    @xmath49    these expressions reproduce the results obtained in @xcite with the only difference that here @xmath42 is the antisymmetric function of @xmath15 in contradistinction to @xcite . 
 + if we use the classical expressions for @xmath50 ( with the same @xmath26 and @xmath29 in all the regions ) @xmath51 and eqs.([10a]),([10b ] ) then we readily obtain ( restricting our attention to the positive region of @xmath42 ) the respective expressions ( cf.@xcite ) for @xmath52 : @xmath53 from ( [ add ] ) follows that the rest energy @xmath54 less than the mass @xmath29 : @xmath55 here the equality sign corresponds to the classical region @xmath56 + from expressions ( [ 13 ] ) , ( [ 14 ] ) we obtain the inversion formulas : @xmath57 @xmath58    if we use classical casimir and expressions ( [ 15 ] ) and ( [ 16 ] ) then the respective casimirs for the energy - momentum in the planck region are    @xmath59    @xmath60    where ( @xmath61 ) corresponds to the positive values of @xmath42 and ( @xmath62 ) corresponds to negative values of @xmath42 . solving eqs.([17a]),([17b ] ) with respect to @xmath42 and choosing the correct signs ( according to the positive and negative values of @xmath42 , remembering that both @xmath63 ) we arrive at the following relation    ; @xmath64 curves correspond to the values of masses @xmath65,width=226,height=226 ]    @xmath66    where the upper(lower ) sign corresponds to @xmath67 respectively . 
 it is seen that the regions of the positive and negative values of @xmath68 are the same with accuracy to the sign . 
 the graph of @xmath68 is shown in fig.1 . 
 + based on the relation between @xmath52 and @xmath69 [ eqs . ( [ 11a ] ) , ( [ 11b ] ) , ( [ 13]),([14 ] ) ] and on the expressions for classical lorentz boost of @xmath69 in the @xmath70-direction with a velocity @xmath71 ( in the units of @xmath72 ) 
 , we can calculate in an elementary fashion the respective boost relations ( found by magueijo and smolin in @xcite with the help of group - theoretical analysis ) energy- momentum @xmath52 at the planck scale . 
 we write them in the dimensionless form :    @xmath73    @xmath74    here @xmath75 is the kroenecker delta - function and @xmath76 . 
 since particle s velocity has been defined as @xmath77 , it is not surprising that eqs.([19a],[19b ] ) yield the velocity addition rule , coinciding with the classical relativistic rule : @xmath78    it was shown in @xcite that within the context of @xmath0-poinciana algebra various possible doubly - special relativity constructions can be viewed as different bases of this algebra . in particular , magueijo - smolin basis @xcite is one of such bases . in a more general scheme of things , j.lukierski and collaborators 
 @xcite demonstrated that all possible double special relativistic constructions differ by a suitable choice of what one defines as an effective mass . 
 + here we show that the magueijo - smolin transformation ( obtained here in an elementary fashion with the help of simple physical postulates)contains an additional physical constraint on the mass . this transformation can be derived pro - forma from @xmath0-deformed algebra , and the result explicitly shows that in this case the particle mass @xmath79 . to demonstrate that we write the relations of the classical basis ( denoted here as @xmath80 ) by rearranging the formulas given in @xcite :    @xmath81\equiv ae^{\overline{\pi}_0}[1-e^{-\overline{\pi}_0}cosh(\overline{\mu})]\ ] ]    @xmath82    where @xmath37 is an arbitrary constant to be determined . 
 the respective casimirs are @xmath83 and @xmath84 + we can symmetrize expressions ( [ 20a ] ) , ( [ 20b ] ) by introducing the following quantities :    @xmath85\ ] ]    @xmath86    combining ( [ 23a ] ) , ( [ 23b ] ) and ( [ 20a ] ) , ( [ 20b ] ) , we obtain :    @xmath87    @xmath88    by comparing eqs.([24a ] ) and ( [ 24b ] ) with eqs . 
 ( [ 13 ] ) and ( [ 14 ] ) we immediately see that magueijo - smolin basis follows from @xmath0-deformed algebra if and only if @xmath89 in this case casimir ( [ 22 ] ) reads @xmath90 comparing eq.([26 ] ) with casimir given by eq.([17a ] ) @xcite we arrive at the conclusion that the mass @xmath29 used in the latter is @xmath91    in addition , if we use ( [ add2 ] ) then eq.([27 ] ) imposes the following condition on the value of the rest energy @xmath92 : @xmath93 + at the first glance this condition looks ( predicated on the restriction on particle s mass @xmath94 ) as overly restrictive . on the other hand , considering magueijo - smolin transform as a `` free - standing '' transformations we are not forced to have an upper bound on the rest energy @xmath54 in the planck region where @xmath95 ( that is one half of the upper bound on @xmath42 ) . 
 still , there is a strong argument in favor of adopting the upper bound on particle s mass . 
 if we would like to be consistent then it seems quite reasonable to expect that all the quantities in the region of planck scales to be bounded from above by planck energy @xmath0 , or bounded from below by planck length @xmath6 . 
 + we have derived magueijo - smolin transformation without resorting to group - theoretical approach by simply defining particle velocity @xmath26 , its mass @xmath29 , and the upper bound on the magnitude of momentum - energy @xmath52 in terms of the respective classical quantities . 
 in particular , the velocity @xmath26 is defined as @xmath77 ( eq.[3a ] ) . if we substitute into this definition the relations between @xmath96 and the respective quantities @xmath97 , eqs . 
 ( [ 23a ] ) , ( [ 23b ] ) ( used in the conventional treatment based on @xmath0-poincare algebra ) we arrive at the value of the velocity @xmath26 which is exactly the right group velocity @xmath98 ( obeying classical addition law ) introduced in @xcite : @xmath99 interestingly enough , the particle velocity is identical in 2 different bases : magueijo - smolin basis and the basis used in @xcite . 
 + to complete our elementary treatment of magueijo - smolin transform , we address its critique expressed in @xcite . 
 it is argued there that a definition of the particle velocity according to hamilton equations results in a paradoxical situation where @xmath100 particles of different masses moving in an inertial frame with the same velocity will have different velocities when viewed from another inertial frame . 
 the fallacy of this conclusion is due to the fact that the authors of @xcite used a @xmath101-@xmath102 hamiltonian formalism . + it has been demonstrated ( e.g.,@xcite,@xcite ) that a velocity definition in a non - commutative space is dictated by an appropriate choice of a @xmath102 hamiltonian formalism ( see also @xcite ) 
 to this end let us consider dimensionless relativistic phase space variables @xmath103 normalized by the appropriate planck scales and whose commutation relations are :    @xmath104&=&\delta_{ij } , \nonumber \\ \lbrack\pi_0,\xi_0\rbrack & = & -(1-\pi_0 ) , \nonumber \\ \lbrack\pi_0,\xi_i\rbrack & = & 0 , \nonumber \\ 
 \lbrack \xi_0,\xi_i\rbrack & = & \xi_i~ ,   \nonumber \\ 
 \lbrack \xi_0,\pi_i\rbrack & = & -\pi_i , \nonumber \\ \lbrack\pi_{\alpha},\pi_{\nu}\rbrack & = & 0\end{aligned}\ ] ]    the @xmath0-deformed hamilton equations then yield ( cf.@xcite ) :    @xmath105    @xmath106    here one particle hamiltonian @xmath107 is taken to be the @xmath0-invariant casimir , eq . : 
 @xmath108 if we use this expression in the hamilton s equations ( [ 31a ] ) , ( [ 31b ] ) we obtain : @xmath109 from eqs.([32 ] ) immediately follows the expression for the velocity ( [ 3a ] ) which was postulated from the very beginning : @xmath110 + another seemingly unphysical prediction(s ) of magueijo - smolin ( ms ) basis , as was pointed out by j.rembielinski and k.smolinski @xcite , is connected with an apparent difficulty in formulating statistical mechanics based on ms basis . 
 it is argued that one - particle partition function is divergent when @xmath111 . 
 however this conclusion is based on an assumption that the temperature in the planck region is the same as in the classical region . 
 this is not true , since the existence of the upper limit on the energy immediately implies that there exist a relation between the temperature ( dimensionless ) @xmath112 in the planck region and its counterpart @xmath113 in the classical region analogous to the relations between energies in these two regions , eq . 
 ( [ 11a ] ) . as a result , it is not difficult to demonstrate that the partition function ( expressed as an integral ) does not have singularities . 
 + additional criticism of @xmath114 transformation is connected to the fact that for a large number @xmath115 of identical particles , each of energy @xmath116 their total internal energy in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath117 ) does not depend on temperature . but this represents not a deficiency of the basis , but on the contrary , its advantage . 
 in fact , since the temperature is bounded from above by @xmath118 , in the limit of infinite number of particles , whose total energy tends to the respective upper boundary ( @xmath119 ) the respective temperature @xmath120 tend to its maximum that is to 1 , which explains an apparent absence of the dependence of the internal energy on temperature . in this case 
 the internal energy is simply equal to the temperature , and both are equal to unity ( in the chosen units ) . 
 + in conclusion we would like to say that ms basis following from very simple and consistent physical postulates introduced here represents an attractive model for a description of phenomena which might be associated with planck scale physics . 
 in fact , the imposition of upper bound on the energy - momentum , and even mass ( if we adopt @xmath0-poinciana roots of the basis ) which are in agreement with a major postulate of planck scale phenomena , is the feature which is @xmath121 in any other bases . 
 still , there are some problems with this ( and to this matter , with any other @xmath0-deformed ) model(s ) . in particular , the commutation relation @xmath122 is not consistent with the well - known string uncertainty relation .",2965,461,16016,7.89 seconds,0.64 MB,0.04192355117139333,0.013163307280954339,0.032881216605014384,0.7931603789329529,medium
"the electron - phonon coupling strongly affects vibrational modes of nano- and micro - electro - mechanical systems . much interest have attracted the effects of this coupling related to the reduced dimensionality of the electron system , as they make it possible to reveal interesting consequences of the electron correlations at the nanoscale , the coulomb blockade being a simple example , cf . @xcite and references therein . much less attention has been paid to the consequences of the electron - phonon coupling , which are related to the discreteness of the vibrational spectrum of a nanosystem , but emerge in the absence of size quantization of the electron motion . one of such consequences , which we study in this paper , is the coupling - induced change of the vibration nonlinearity . strong nonlinearity is a generic feature of vibrations in small systems @xcite . its easily accessible manifestation is the dependence of the mode frequencies on the vibration amplitudes . this dependence corresponds to the  self - action "" of the mode , and its familiar analog in bulk crystals are acoustic solitons @xcite ; however , the nonlinearity required for observing such solitons usually is sufficiently strong only for high - frequency phonons . also , the change of the eigenfrequency with the mode amplitude is of interest for modes with a discrete frequency spectrum , such as standing waves in mesoscopic systems , but not for propagating waves with a quasi - continuous spectrum .    much attention have been recently attracting si - based nano- and micromechanical systems , see @xcite and references therein . in such systems there was observed an unexpectedly large change of the amplitude dependence of the vibration frequency with the varying electron density @xcite . when the doping level was increased from @xmath0  @xmath1 to @xmath2  @xmath1 , the nonlinearity parameter increased by more than an order of magnitude . moreover , the nonlinearity change was different for the vibrational modes with different spatial structure .    in this paper we develop a theory of the nonlinearity of vibrational modes in semiconductor nano- and micro - mechanical systems with high electron density . we show that the electron - phonon coupling can lead to a strong self - action of the vibrational modes , which in turn significantly modifies the amplitude dependence of the mode frequencies . we find the dependence of the effect on the electron density and temperature .    for bulk semiconductors , the effect of the electron - phonon coupling on the elastic properties , including the three - phonon coupling , was first analyzed by keyes @xcite . the analysis referred to @xmath3-ge and was based on the deformation potential approximation . the idea was that deformation lifts the degeneracy of the equivalent electron valleys , which leads to a redistribution of the electrons over the valleys . in turn , such redistribution changes the speed of sound depending on the direction and polarization of the sound waves and also affects the sound speed in the presence of uniaxial stress . this theory was extended to silicon and the corresponding measurements were done by hall @xcite . however , hall also observed the change of the speed of transverse sound waves and the effect of stress on sound propagation in the geometries , where these effects are due to shear deformation and do not arise in the deformation potential model . a theory of the change of the linear shear elastic constant in silicon due to the intervalley redistribution of the electrons was developed by cerdeira and cardona @xcite . as we show , in mesoscopic systems the strain - induced redistribution of the electrons over the valleys of the conduction band leads to the previously unexplored strong fourth - order nonlinearity of the vibrational modes . this nonlinearity gives a major contribution to the amplitude dependence of the vibration frequency . the redistribution also leads to a temperature dependence of the frequencies . the magnitudes of the effects sensitively depends on the mode structure . we describe them for several types of modes , including those studied in the experiment @xcite and qualitatively compare the results with the observations . the theoretical results refer to both degenerate and nondegenerate electron systems . specific calculations are done for silicon resonators .    in sec . [ sec : model ] we give , for completeness , the expressions for the mode normalization and the amplitude - dependent frequency shift of coupled nonlinear modes in a nano- or micro - system . in sec . [ sec : e - ph_coupling ] and appendix  [ appendixa ] we provide expressions for the electron - phonon coupling induced change of the elasticity parameters , including the parameters of quartic nonlinearity . in sec . [ sec : explicit_form ] we discuss the asymptotic behavior of the parameters of quartic nonlinearity for low and high electron density and give their explicit form for silicon . in sec . [ sec : simple_modes ] we calculate the nonlinear frequency shift for several frequently used vibrational modes in single - crystal silicon systems and show the dependence of this shift on the electron density and temperature . the explicit analytical expressions are given in appendices  [ sec : lame ] and [ sec : extension ] . [ sec : conclusions ] contains concluding remarks . of primary interest for nano- and micro - mechanical systems are comparatively low - frequency modes with wavelength on the order of the maximal size of the system . examples are provided by long - wavelength flexural modes of nanotubes , nanobeams , and nano / micro - membranes , or acoustic - type modes in microplates or beams . these modes are easy to excite and detect . we will enumerate them by index @xmath4 . their dynamics is described by the elasticity theory @xcite . the spatial structure of the displacement field of a mode @xmath5 in the harmonic approximation is determined by the boundary conditions . we will choose @xmath5 dimensionless , so that in our finite - size system @xmath6 here , @xmath7 is the volume of the system . we assumed that the mode eigenfrequencies @xmath8 are nondegenerate ; including degenerate modes is straightforward . for simplicity , we also assumed that the system is spatially uniform ; an extension to spatially nonuniform systems is straightforward as well . we emphasize the distinction of the normalization ( [ eq : normalization ] ) from the conventional normalization for bulk crystals , where @xmath4 corresponds to the wave vector and the branch number , and the normalization integral is independent of the volume . the normalization ( [ eq : normalization ] ) is convenient for the analysis of low - frequency modes with the discrete spectrum characteristic of mesoscopic systems . such modes are standing waves , and therefore vectors @xmath9 can be chosen real . the low - frequency part of the displacement can be written as @xmath10 functions @xmath11 give the mode amplitudes . in the harmonic approximation the dynamics of the standing waves is described by the hamiltonian @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the momentum of mode @xmath4 and @xmath14 is the mass of the system . the anharmonicity of the crystal leads to mode - mode coupling . within the elasticity theory this coupling is described by the terms in the hamiltonian , which are cubic and quartic in the strain tensor . we will not consider higher - order terms , which are small for the mode amplitudes of interest . from the expansion , we obtain the nonlinear part of the hamiltonian in the form @xmath15 equation is essentially an expansion in the ratio of the mode amplitudes to their characteristic wavelength , which is of the order of the appropriate linear dimension of the system . this is why mesoscopic systems are of particular interest , as here vibrations of low - frequency eigenmodes become nonlinear for already small vibration amplitudes .    a familiar consequence of nonlinearity in nano- and micromechanical systems is the dependence of the vibration frequency of a mode on its own amplitude and on the amplitudes of other modes , see ref .   for a review . in particular , the change @xmath16 of the mode frequency due to the vibrations of the mode itself , @xmath17 , is @xcite @xmath18a_\nu^2,\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath19 and we kept the terms of the first order in @xmath20 and the second order in @xmath21 .    the nonlinear mode coupling ( [ eq : anharmonic_hamiltonian ] ) leads also to the frequency shift due to thermal vibrations of the modes . the dominating contribution to this shift for low - frequency modes comes from their coupling to modes with frequencies @xmath22 , which have a much higher density of states . this shift is described by an expression that is similar to eq . ( [ eq : duffing_shift ] ) with @xmath23 replaced by @xmath24 and placed under the sum over @xmath25 , in the classical limit . we will consider the vibration nonlinearity due to the electron - phonon coupling in multi - valley semiconductors with cubic symmetry , silicon and germanium being the best known examples . in such semiconductors , the energy valleys of the conduction band are located at high - symmetry axes of the brillouin zone . strain lifts the symmetry and thus the degeneracy of the valleys . the simplest mechanism of the electron - phonon coupling is the deformation potential . here , the energy shift @xmath26 of valley @xmath27 is determined by the deformation potential parameters @xmath28 and @xmath29 of the coupling to a uniaxial strain along the symmetry axis of the valley and to dilatation , respectively . in terms of the strain tensor @xmath30 we have @xmath31 , where @xmath32 , with @xmath33 being the unit vector along the symmetry axis of the valley . we use the hat symbol to indicate tensors and symbol  @xmath34 "" to indicate tensor products . the analysis below is not limited to the deformation potential approximation . an important extension will be discussed using silicon as an example . we assume that the strain varies in time and space slowly compared to the reciprocal rate of intervalley electron scattering and the intervalley scattering length , respectively . then the electron system follows the strain adiabatically . the electron density @xmath35 in valley @xmath27 is decreased or increased depending on whether the bottom of the valley goes up or down . in the single - electron approximation and for the deformation potential coupling , the electron free energy density for a given strain is @xmath36 + n^{(\alpha ) } ( \rb ) \xi^{(\alpha)}_{ij } \ep_{ji}(\rb)\}$ ] where @xmath37 $ ] is the free energy density for electrons with density @xmath38 in a valley in the absence of coupling to phonons . the electro - neutrality requires that the total electron density summed over the valleys be constant . the free energy density @xmath39 has to be minimized over @xmath35 to meet this constraint . this gives the change of the electron chemical potential @xmath40 due to strain @xmath41 . the resulting increment of the electron free energy density has the form of a series expansion in the strain tensor , @xmath42 here @xmath43 , and @xmath44 are tensors of ranks 2 , 4 , 6 , and 8 , respectively . they are contracted with the tensor products of the strain tensor @xmath41 . respectively , @xmath45 are the electronic contributions to the linear ( for @xmath46 ) and nonlinear ( for @xmath47 ) elasticity parameters of the crystal . these contributions are isothermal , but since the change of the mode frequencies from the electron - phonon coupling is small and the nonlinearity is also small , the difference with the adiabatic expressions can be disregarded .    to the third order in @xmath41 the expression for @xmath48 in terms of the shift of the valleys was found by keyes @xcite in the analysis of sound wave propagation . however , to find the parameters of the quartic nonlinearity of resonant modes in small systems , which is of primary interest to us , we also need to keep quartic terms in eq . ( [ eq : free_energy_expansion ] ) .    as seen from the explicit form of the parameters of the expansion ( [ eq : free_energy_expansion ] ) given in appendix [ appendixa ] , @xmath49^{k-1}$ ] ( @xmath50 ) , where @xmath51 is the electron chemical potential in the absence of strain ; it is determined by the total ( summed over the valleys ) electron density @xmath3 . of central importance for the analysis is that parameter @xmath52 for electron densities @xmath53 and room temperatures , i.e. @xmath54 as a consequence , the coefficients at the nonlinear in @xmath41 terms in eq . ( [ eq : free_energy_expansion ] ) quickly increase with the increasing order of the nonlinearity [ the overall series ( [ eq : free_energy_expansion ] ) is converging fast because of the smallness of the strain tensor ] . the increase of @xmath45 with @xmath55 allows us to keep in @xmath41 only the terms linear in the lattice displacement , i.e. , to set @xmath56 , where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the components of the displacement and the coordinates , respectively . indeed , in this case a @xmath55th term of the series ( [ eq : free_energy_expansion ] ) is of order @xmath55 in the displacement . if we included the quadratic in @xmath59 term into one of the @xmath41 tensors in the @xmath55th term , this term would become of order @xmath60 in the displacement . however , for linear @xmath41 the @xmath61th term in the series ( [ eq : free_energy_expansion ] ) is also of the @xmath61th order in the displacement , but is larger by factor @xmath62 .    for linear @xmath41 , the total strain is a sum of partial contributions of strain from individual modes . for mode @xmath4 , such partial contribution is expressed in terms of the scaled displacement @xmath5 [ see eq . ( [ eq : displacement ] ) ] as @xmath63 , where @xmath64 $ ] . we note that , in contrast to the dimensionless strain tensor @xmath41 , tensor @xmath65 has dimension [ length]@xmath66 .    from eq . ( [ eq : free_energy_expansion ] ) we find the electronic contributions to the nonlinearity parameters @xmath67 in hamiltonian ( [ eq : anharmonic_hamiltonian ] ) , @xmath68 where @xmath69 ; tensors @xmath70 are independent of @xmath71 .    similarly , the electronic contribution to the eigenfrequency is @xmath72 generally , the term @xmath73 leads to mode mixing ; however , if the mode frequencies are nondegenerate , this mixing is weak and can be disregarded , to the leading order in the electron - phonon coupling . one can see that the effect of the static stress @xmath74 can be disregarded as well . the frequency change ( [ eq : frequency_change ] ) depends on temperature because of the temperature dependence of @xmath75 . the nonlinearity ( [ eq : nonlin_params ] ) also leads to a temperature dependence of the mode eigenfrequency . together they modify the temperature dependence of the mode eigenfrequencies compared to that of undoped crystals . this modification often weakens the temperature dependence of the eigenfrequencies , which proves very important for applications of micro - mechanical systems in devices that work in a broad temperature range @xcite . equations ( [ eq : free_energy_expansion ] ) - ( [ eq : frequency_change ] ) are generic and apply beyond the deformation potential approximation . this is of particular importance for silicon . here , the electron band valleys lie on the @xmath76-axes close to the @xmath77-points on the zone boundaries where two electron energy bands cross . lattice strain can lead to a band splitting at @xmath77-points and a shift of the valleys @xcite . importantly , this shift results from a shear strain , which does not lead to a linear in the strain shift in the deformation potential approximation . the valley shift is quadratic in @xmath41 in this case , as explained in appendix  [ appendixa ] , which corresponds to an effectively two - phonon coupling . the coupling parameter @xmath78 is quadratic in the strain - induced band splitting , see eq . ( [ eq : general_shift ] ) . it is large , much larger than the constant @xmath28 . therefore the arguments given below eq . ( [ eq : strong_coupling ] ) apply in this case as well . for purely shear strain in silicon , terms of odd order in @xmath41 in @xmath48 , eq . ( [ eq : free_energy_expansion ] ) , vanish . [ cols=""^,^,^,^ , < "" , ]     [ table : tensors ] tensors @xmath79 can be obtained by minimizing the free energy density of the electron system for a given strain and expanding the result in a series in @xmath41 . a general procedure that allows one to find the components @xmath79 for @xmath80 is described in appendix  [ appendixa ] . using the symmetry arguments , the elasticity tensors are conveniently written in the contracted ( voigt ) notation where the symmetric strain tensor is associated with a six - component vector . then the nonlinear elasticity tensors @xmath81 and @xmath82 become tensors of rank three and four in the corresponding vector space . we use notation @xmath83 for tensors @xmath84 in these notations to emphasize that we are calculating corrections to the nonlinear elasticity tensors due to the electron - phonon coupling . the explicit expressions for the nonlinear elasticity tensors @xmath85 are given in table  [ table : tensors ] . they refer to silicon and include the contributions that come from both the deformation potential coupling and from the splitting of the electron bands due to shear strain . in the deformation potential approximation , the components of the third - rank tensor @xmath85 , which determine the cubic in the strain terms in the free energy , were found earlier @xcite . therefore we give only the components that contain a contribution from shear strain . the fourth - rank tensor @xmath85 determines the quartic in the strain terms in the free energy and has not been discussed before , to the best of our knowledge . we give all independent components of this tensor . it is expressed in terms of the derivative of the electron density @xmath3 over the chemical potential in the absence of strain @xmath51 , which is a familiar thermodynamic characteristic . it is intuitively clear that the considered effect of the change of the electron density in different valleys in response to strain should be related to the derivative @xmath86 . interestingly , because we consider nonlinear response to strain , the expressions in table  [ table : tensors ] contain also higher - order derivatives of @xmath3 over @xmath51 . as we will see , this leads to a nontrivial behavior of the nonlinear frequency shift with varying temperature and density . the considered mechanism of the strain - induced inter - valley electron redistribution does not contribute to the components @xmath87 and @xmath88 , therefore @xmath89 . the expressions for @xmath85 simplify in the case of low doping ( or high temperature ) , where the electron gas is strongly nondegenerate , and in the opposite case of a strongly degenerate electron gas . for a nondegenerate gas , where the chemical potential in the absence of strain is @xmath90 , we have in table  [ table : tensors ] @xmath91 with @xmath92 . the @xmath51-dependent factors @xmath93 in @xmath94 and its derivatives cancel each other in the expressions for @xmath85 and drop out from these expressions . the dependence of @xmath85 on density is then just linear , @xmath95 . parameters @xmath96 in table  [ table : tensors ] depend only on temperature , @xmath97 and @xmath98 . the decrease of the nonlinear elasticity parameters with increasing temperature in a nondegenerate electron gas is easy to understand . the effect we consider is determined by the competition between the energetically favorable unequal population of the electron energy valleys in a strained crystal and the entropically more favorable equal valley population . with increasing temperature the entropic factor becomes stronger , leading to a smaller population difference and thus smaller effect of the electron system on the vibrations .    for strong doping , where @xmath99 , we have @xmath100 , and then @xmath101 with @xmath92 . therefore parameters @xmath102 in table  [ table : tensors ] become temperature independent , with @xmath103 , and @xmath104 . the results on the asymptotic behavior of the corrections to nonlinear elasticity are not limited to silicon . since parameters @xmath105 are given by the coefficients in the general expansion of the free energy in strain , ( [ eq : total_f ] ) , these results can be applied to the nonlinear elasticity induced by the electron - phonon coupling in other multi - valley semiconductors . to illustrate this point , in appendix  [ sec : germanium ] we give @xmath85 tensor in germanium . the difference between the asymptotic behavior of the tensors @xmath85 in the limits of nondegenerate and strongly degenerate electron gas can lead to a peculiar density and temperature dependence of the nonlinear frequency shift of the vibrational modes . it comes from the coefficients @xmath102 containing higher - order derivatives of @xmath3 with respect to @xmath51 . in the transition region @xmath106 , thinking of the competition between the entropic and energetic factors does not provide a simple insight into the behavior of @xmath85 , as both the energy and the entropy are complicated functions of density and temperature . the nonlinear elasticity tensors in table  [ table : tensors ] give the doping - induced contributions to the nonlinearity parameters of the eigenmodes of micro- and nanomechanical systems . these contributions are described by eq . ( [ eq : nonlin_params ] ) . as mentioned before , an important characteristic of the mode nonlinearity is the dependence of the mode frequency on the vibration amplitude . to the leading order , it is given by eq . ( [ eq : duffing_shift ] ) . this dependence has a contribution from the nonlinearity of an undoped crystal , which is quadratic in the parameters of the cubic nonlinearity ; for example , if the latter is described by the grneisen constant , the corresponding contribution is quadratic in this constant . it is typically small . there is also a contribution from the quartic nonlinearity ; the parameters of such nonlinearity are not known in undoped crystals and are not expected to be large . respectively , the amplitude dependence of the vibration frequency for low - frequency modes in weakly doped single - crystal micro - mechanical systems is relatively weak @xcite . a feature of the doping - induced nonlinearity described by table  [ table : tensors ] is that the quartic in the strain term in the free energy has a large coefficient compared to the cubic term , cf . ( [ eq : strong_coupling ] ) and the discussion below this equation . therefore , in eq . ( [ eq : duffing_shift ] ) for the amplitude dependence of vibration frequency one can keep only the duffing nonlinearity constant @xmath107 . the contribution from the cubic nonlinearity terms @xmath108 can be disregarded . for a mode @xmath4 , the doping - induced contribution to @xmath107 is equal to @xmath109 in eq . ( [ eq : nonlin_params ] ) .    to find the dependence of the mode frequency on the vibration amplitude we go through the following steps . first , we find the normal modes of interest for the given geometry of the system , with account taken of the boundary conditions , and normalize the displacements @xmath5 as indicated in eq . ( [ eq : normalization ] ) . we use @xmath5 to find the strain tensor @xmath110 . the result is substituted into eq . ( [ eq : nonlin_params ] ) and is convoluted with tensor @xmath82 , giving the value of @xmath107 , which is then used in eq . ( [ eq : duffing_shift ] ) to find the frequency dependence on the vibration amplitude @xmath16 . of particular interest is the relative frequency shift @xmath111 . to find this shift to the leading order , one can disregard nonlinearity when calculating the eigenfrequency @xmath8 . then , from eq . ( [ eq : duffing_shift ] ) , @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the full tensor of linear elasticity , which includes the major term of the linear elasticity of the undoped crystal and the doping - induced correction @xmath75 .    an important feature of the relative shift @xmath111 is its scaling with the size of the system . the vibration amplitude @xmath114 in eq . ( [ eq : scaling ] ) can be scaled by the lateral dimension @xmath115 , for example the length of a nanobeam or a nanowire for an extension mode , or the size of the square for a lam mode , or the diameter of a disk for a breathing mode in a disk . respectively , we write @xmath116 . then , if one takes into account the explicit form ( [ eq : nonlin_params ] ) of the parameter @xmath117 , one finds from eq . ( [ eq : scaling ] ) that the ratio @xmath118 is independent of the system size for the aforementioned modes . in this estimate we used that the tensors @xmath119 are material parameters and are independent of the geometry . we also used that the modes of interest have typical wavelength @xmath120 , and therefore @xmath65 scales as @xmath121 . most of the experiments in nano- and micromechanics are done with nanobeams , nanowires , membranes , or thin plates . in such systems the thickness is much smaller than the length or , in the case of membranes or plates , the lateral dimensions . then , from the boundary condition of the absence of tangential stress on free surfaces @xcite , it follows that the strain tensor @xmath41 weakly depends on the coordinate normal to the surface . this simplifies the denominator in eq . ( [ eq : scaling ] ) , making it proportional to the thickness . similarly , from eq . ( [ eq : nonlin_params ] ) @xmath107 is also proportional to the thickness , and the thickness drops out of eq . ( [ eq : scaling ] ) . the explicit expressions for @xmath122 and @xmath107 that determine the denominator and the numerator in eq . ( [ eq : scaling ] ) , respectively , are given in appendices  [ sec : lame ] and [ sec : extension ] for lam and extension modes . these expressions are cumbersome , and it is convenient to use symbolic programming to obtain them .      the scaled ratio @xmath118 that characterizes the relative nonlinear frequency shift is shown in fig . [ fig : n_dependence ] for several modes that are often used in single - crystal silicon mems . this ratio depends on the type of the mode and the crystal orientation . figure  [ fig : n_dependence ] refers to high - symmetry crystal orientations , in which case the modes have a comparatively simple spatial structure and the surfaces can be made smooth . we used the values @xmath123  ev @xcite , @xmath124  ev , the effective mass for density of states @xmath125 @xcite , and the temperature - dependent linear elasticity parameters given in ref . @xcite . figure  [ fig : n_dependence ] shows that the electron - redistribution induced nonlinearity of vibrational modes is very strong . for the ratio of the vibration amplitude to the system size @xmath126 and the mode eigenfrequency @xmath127  mhz , the frequency change can be as a large as @xmath128  khz . this explains , qualitatively , the observations @xcite . a quantitative comparison with the experiment @xcite is complicated , as the observations refer to different samples . our preliminary results show an excellent quantitative agreement with the data obtained for the same sample at different temperatures and for different types of modes @xcite . the nonlinear frequency shift displays several characteristic features , as seen from fig . [ fig : n_dependence ] . one of them is the strong dependence of the shift on the type of the mode and the crystal orientation . for both the lam and the extension mode , the shift is much stronger for crystals cut out in @xmath76 direction than in @xmath129 direction . this is a consequence of the electron energy valleys lying along the @xmath76 axes , making the system more  responsive "" to the lattice displacement along these axes . interestingly , in the both configurations the shifts for the lam modes are larger than for the extension modes . a somewhat unexpected feature is the nonmonotonic dependence of the nonlinear frequency shift on the electron density and temperature . the nonmonotoncity occurs in the range where the electron system is close to degeneracy , @xmath130 , and it strongly depends on the crystal orientation . it is much stronger for crystals cut in @xmath76 than @xmath129 directions . for a crystal cut in @xmath129 direction , both the density and temperature dependence of the shift are monotonic in the case of the lam mode , whereas for the extension mode the nonmonotonicity is weak . the nonmonotonicity of the frequency shift stems from the behavior of the parameters @xmath131 in the range @xmath106 . as seen from table  [ table : tensors ] , parameter @xmath132 exponentially increases with the increasing @xmath133 for negative @xmath133 , but for large positive @xmath133 it falls off as @xmath134 . it has a pronounced maximum for @xmath135 . parameter @xmath136 also displays a maximum , which occurs for @xmath137 . in contrast , parameters @xmath138 depend on @xmath133 monotonically .    the results of appendices  [ sec : lame ] and [ sec : extension ] show that , for the lam and extension modes in crystals cut in @xmath76 direction , the relative shift @xmath111 is determined by coefficient @xmath132 , which explains the nonmonotonicity of the shift . for crystals cut in @xmath129 , the shift of the lam mode is fully determined by coefficient @xmath139 and is monotonic , whereas for the extension mode the expression for the shift has contributions from @xmath132 , @xmath136 , and @xmath139 that partly compensate each other , leading to a comparatively small shift all together and its weak nonmonotonicity . the results of this paper show that the electron - phonon coupling strongly affects the nonlinearity of vibrational modes in semiconductor - based nano- and micromechanical systems . the mechanism of the effect is the strain - induced redistribution of the electrons between the valleys of the conduction band . the redistribution results from lifting the degeneracy of the electron energy spectrum by the strain from a vibrational mode . the analysis refers to the range of temperatures where the rate of intervalley scattering strongly exceeds the frequencies of the considered modes . in this case the valley populations follow the strain adiabatically . the change of the valley populations is a strongly nonlinear function of the strain tensor . the respective expansion of the free energy in the strain is an expansion in the strain multiplied by the ratio of the electron - phonon coupling energy ( in particular , the deformation potential ) to the chemical potential of the electron system or the temperature . this ratio is large , @xmath140 . it is this parameter that makes the nonlinearity of the vibrational modes in doped semiconductor structures strong .    of special interest in nano- and micromechanical systems is the amplitude dependence of the vibration frequency . to the leading order , it is determined by the quartic terms in the expansion of the free energy in strain . these terms are comparatively large in doped crystals . we have calculated the nonlinear elasticity tensor that describes the electron contribution to the terms in the free energy , which are quartic in the strain . the explicit expressions for the tensor components refer to semiconductors with the valleys on @xmath76 axes , in particular , to silicon . we have also found this tensor for germanium . in silicon , along with the deformation potential coupling , an important role is played by the coupling to shear strain . such strain lifts the band degeneracy at the zone boundary and is effectively described by a two - phonon coupling . we show that this coupling also leads to strong nonlinearity of vibrational modes . the parameter of the electron coupling to shear strain in silicon is not easy to access in the experiment @xcite . measurements of the nonlinear frequency shift provide a direct means for determining this parameter . in particular , the nonlinear frequency shift of the fundamental lam mode in a silicon plate cut along @xmath129 axes is determined by this parameter only , except for small corrections from the nonlinearity of the undoped crystal . we found that the nonlinear frequency shift strongly depends on the type of a vibrational mode and the crystal orientation . we also found that the ratio of the frequency shift to the squared vibration amplitude can be profoundly nonmonotonic as a function of electron density and temperature . the results provide an insight into the experimentally observed strong mode nonlinearity in doped crystals @xcite . in terms of applications , they enable choosing the appropriate range of doping and the temperature regime to optimize the operation of nano- and micromechanical resonators .    we are grateful to t. kenny for attracting our attention to the problem and for stimulating discussions . we benefited from useful discussions with j. atalaya , d. heinz , p. polunin , s. w. shaw , and y. yang . this research was supported in part by the us defense advanced research projects agency ( grant no . fa8650 - 16 - 1 - 7600 ) . the major effect of a strain on the electron free energy comes from the shift of the energy valleys . we will assume that valley @xmath27 is shifted in energy by @xmath26 and the shift is small , @xmath141 , where @xmath51 is the chemical potential in the absence of strain . we further assume that the vibrations are slow compared to the time it takes the electron system to come , locally , to thermal equilibrium for given values of @xmath26 , i.e. , the temperature and the chemical potential are the same in all valleys . since for high electron densities the thermal conductivity is high , the change of the temperature compared to the ambient temperature can be disregarded ; also , as mentioned in the main text , the electron density @xmath3 summed over all valleys is constant . expanding the electron free energy density to the 4th order in the strain - induced shifts @xmath26 , we find that , in an @xmath142-valley semiconductor , the change @xmath48 of the free energy density is @xmath143 + \frac{1}{6}\frac{f''_{1/2}}{f_{1/2}}\left[\overline { \delta_\ep^3 } -3\overline { \delta_\ep^2}\;\overline\delta_\ep + 2(\overline\delta_\ep)^3 \right ] \nonumber\\      & + \frac{1}{8}\frac{{f''_{1/2}}^2}{f_{1/2}f'_{1/2}}\left[(\overline { \delta_\ep^2})^2 -2\overline { \delta_\ep^2}\,(\overline\delta_\ep)^2 + ( \overline\delta_\ep)^4 \right]+      \frac{1}{24}\frac{f'''_{1/2}}{f_{1/2}}\left [      4\overline { \delta_\ep^3}\;\overline\delta_\ep - \overline { \delta_\ep^4 } -       6\overline { \delta_\ep^2}\,(\overline\delta_\ep)^2 + 3(\overline\delta_\ep)^4       \right].\end{aligned}\ ] ]    here , @xmath144 . we use the standard notation @xmath145 $ ] ; primes indicate differentiation over @xmath146 , for example , @xmath147 . function @xmath94 and its derivatives are calculated for @xmath92 . equation ( [ eq : total_f ] ) immediately gives the tensors @xmath148 of the expansion of the free energy increment ( [ eq : free_energy_expansion ] ) if one expresses the shift @xmath26 of the valleys in terms of the strain tensor . in the deformation potential approximation the relation between @xmath26 and @xmath41 is given in the main text , see also eq . ( [ eq : general_shift ] ) below .    in the case of si crystals , which are often used in micromechanical resonators , an important contribution to @xmath26 comes from the shear - strain induced splitting of the electron energy bands at the zone boundary . shear strain does not lead to the valley shift in the deformation potential approximation . the overall shift of valley @xmath27 , to the lowest order in the coupling that causes it ( i.e. , to the first order in the deformation potential where its contribution is nonzero and to the second order in the band splitting for shear strain ) is @xcite : @xmath149 here we use that silicon has six valleys located at the @xmath76 axes , and we chose the coordinate axes @xmath150 along @xmath76 . respectively , the valley index @xmath27 takes on three values that correspond to the @xmath150 axes ( the valleys lying on the same axis , but in the opposite directions , are equivalent ) . the strain @xmath151 , which enters the second term in the right - hand side of eq . ( [ eq : general_shift ] ) , is a component of the strain tensor @xmath30 with @xmath152 such that @xmath153 and @xmath154 . the parameter @xmath155 is the interband matrix element of the electron - phonon coupling calculated for the electron conduction bands @xmath156 and @xmath157 at the @xmath77 point on the boundary of the brillouin zone , where the bands cross ; @xmath158 is the energy separation between the bands @xmath156 and @xmath157 at the value of the wave vector @xmath159 that corresponds to the conduction band minimum . parameter @xmath78 is the effective deformation potential of two - phonon coupling to shear strain . the numerical value of @xmath78 is not well known . the experimental data give @xmath160  ev @xcite and the numerical data on the band splitting give @xmath161  ev @xcite so that @xmath78 is in the range of @xmath162  ev ; this is essentially an order of magnitude estimate .    in calculating @xmath48 in eq . ( [ eq : total_f ] ) we kept terms that are quartic in @xmath41 . the components of the tensors @xmath45 in eq . ( [ eq : free_energy_expansion ] ) are expressed in terms of @xmath48 as @xmath163 tensors @xmath84 are symmetric with respect to the interchange of indices @xmath164 and the pairs @xmath165 . for the considered long - wavelength strain , tensors @xmath45 are independent of coordinates . the corrections @xmath166 to the linear elasticity tensors were found previously @xcite and are not discussed in this paper . in this section we provide the corrections to the nonlinear elastic constants of germanium , which are due to the redistribution of the electrons over the valleys . germanium has four equivalent valleys in the conduction band , which are located on the boundary of the brillouin zone along @xmath167 axes . we use the voigt notation and write the components of the corrections to the nonlinear elasticity tensor @xmath85 in the frame where the axes @xmath168 are along the @xmath76 directions of the crystal . using the results of appendix  [ appendixa ] , we obtain @xmath169 the notations are the same as in appendix  [ appendixa ] and in table  [ table : tensors ] . the electron - phonon coupling does not contribute to the other third- and fourth - order elastic constants . corrections @xmath170 and @xmath171 for germanium were found by keyes  @xcite ; however , his final expression for @xmath171 differs from eq .

The coupling between electrons and phonons in these systems leads to a strong nonlinearity in the vibrational frequencies, which can be described by a quartic nonlinearity. The nonlinearity arises from the interaction between the electrons and phonons, which causes a change in the vibrational frequencies of the system.

The text highlights the importance of understanding the effects of electron","we study the effect of the electron - phonon coupling on vibrational eigenmodes of nano- and micro - mechanical systems made of semiconductors with equivalent energy valleys . 
 we show that the coupling can lead to a strong mode nonlinearity . 
 the mechanism is the lifting of the valley degeneracy by the strain . 
 the redistribution of the electrons between the valleys is controlled by a large ratio of the electron - phonon coupling constant to the electron chemical potential or temperature . 
 we find the quartic in the strain terms in the electron free energy , which determine the amplitude dependence of the mode frequencies . 
 this dependence is calculated for silicon micro - systems . 
 it is significantly different for different modes and the crystal orientation , and can vary nonmonotonously with the electron density and temperature .",43977,520,856,41.20 seconds,-14.25 MB,0.4682926829268293,0.1773399014778325,0.3219512195121951,0.8658549785614014,medium
"a maximally extended and regular covering of the schwarzschild vacuum is now a fundamental part of any introduction to general relativity . almost always the covering is given by way of the implicit kruskal @xcite - szekeres @xcite procedure @xcite . however , as emphasized long ago by ehlers @xcite , an explicit maximally extended and regular covering of the schwarzschild vacuum is known and was first given by israel @xcite . unfortunately , despite the fact that these coordinates offer many advantages over the kruskal - szekeres coordinates , they are almost never used . in this paper i extend israel s procedure to the schwarzschild - de sitter class of vacua in four dimensions and then to arbitrary dimensions @xmath0 assuming a @xmath1 sphere as in the tangherlini generalization of the schwarzschild vacuum . moreover , it is made clear that these coordinates offer important advantages over the kruskal - szekeres procedure . these advantages include : an explicit representation of the line element that can be extended to arbitrary dimension , a simultaneous covering of both the black hole and cosmological horizons and derivation by direct integration of einstein s equations @xcite without recourse to coordinate transformations . we start with a spherically symmetric spacetime in coordinates @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a null four - vector so that the line element takes the form @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the metric of a unit two - sphere ( @xmath6 ) . further , setting @xmath7 ( so that trajectories of constant @xmath8 and @xmath9 are radial null geodesics affinely parameterized by @xmath10 ) it follows that @xmath11 . defining @xmath12 and rewriting @xmath13 as @xmath14 we set @xmath15 in ( [ generalmetric ] ) which remains a completely general spherically symmetric spacetime . the expansion of @xmath16 reduces to @xmath17 associated with the vector field @xmath18 we have @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 the trajectories of constant @xmath22 and @xmath9 are radial null geodesics ( affinely parameterized by @xmath14 ) only for @xmath23 . note that if @xmath24 then @xmath25 is tangent to a radial null geodesic and clearly @xmath10 is again affine . the associated geodesics immediately follow as @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a constant . important examples of this special case are given below . for the spacetime ( [ generalmetric ] ) with @xmath15 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 where @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) and @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) are constants , it follows that @xmath35 @xmath36 and @xmath37 where @xmath38 @xmath39 is the ricci tensor , @xmath40 the ricciscalar and @xmath41 the weyl tensor . viewing @xmath28 as a constant of nature and @xmath33 a property of the vacuum , it is clear from ( [ lambda ] ) that the specification of @xmath31 does not determine the physical situation uniquely . since , by ( [ r(u , w ) ] ) , the axes are centered on @xmath42 , it is important to distinguish ranges in @xmath31 . writing @xmath43 with @xmath44 and @xmath45 it follows immediately from ( [ lambda ] ) that @xmath46 it follows from ( [ crange ] ) that all values of @xmath47 are determined uniquely by @xmath48 using the following ranges : @xmath49 for @xmath50 and @xmath51 for @xmath52 . the latter range is of no interest and is not discussed here . the one independent invariant derivable from the riemmann tensor without differentiation can be taken to be ( [ weylscalar ] ) and so with @xmath14 and @xmath10 extending over the reals , the vacua are maximally extended and regular for @xmath53 ( and for all finite @xmath54 if @xmath55 ) . in particular , note that @xmath56    with ( [ r(u , w ) ] ) it follows that @xmath57 from ( [ metric ] ) and ( [ r(u , w ) ] ) it follows that trajectories of constant @xmath22 and @xmath9 are radial null geodesics only for @xmath58 . more generally , the radial null geodesics that satisfy @xmath59 with @xmath60 given by ( [ metric ] ) and ( [ r(u , w ) ] ) , can be written down in terms of elementary functions ( as explained below ) . note that for these trajectories @xmath61 as @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) and @xmath64 as @xmath65 . we distinguish the cases : @xmath55 ( de sitter ) , @xmath66 ( bertotti - kasner ) , @xmath67 ( schwarzschild ) , @xmath68 ( schwarzschild - de sitter ) , @xmath69 ( schwarzschild - anti de sitter ) and discuss them below . for the case @xmath67 the coordinates were first obtained by israel @xcite . not covered as special cases are anti de sitter space ( see appendix a ) and the degenerate schwarzschild - de sitter spacetime ( see appendix b ) .      with @xmath55 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 and we have de sitter space . the metric simplifies to @xmath72 trajectories with four tangents @xmath73 are radial null geodesics ( so @xmath10 is affine for both radial null directions ) . we can write these geodesics in the form @xmath74 where @xmath27 is a constant . the negative cosmological horizons ( @xmath75 ) are then given by @xmath76 where the expansion @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) vanishes . some details are shown in fig . [ desitterfig ] .      with @xmath79 we have bertotti - kasner space . the metric simplifies to @xmath80 trajectories with four tangents @xmath81 are radial null geodesics ( so again @xmath10 is affine for both radial null directions ) but now @xmath82 . we can write these geodesics in the form @xmath83 where @xmath27 is a constant . the @xmath84 plane is like that of de sitter space now with @xmath85 ( again @xmath76 ) distinguishing the branches of the @xmath86 geodesics . this space shows that the birkhoff theorem does not extend directly to @xmath87 ( see the case @xmath88 below ) @xcite .      with @xmath67 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 and we have the schwarzschild vacuum in israel coordinates @xcite . the metric simplifies to @xmath91 trajectories with four tangents @xmath92 are radial null geodesics so @xmath10 is not affine . now @xmath93 . we write these geodesics in the form @xmath94 where @xmath27 is a constant . some details are shown in fig . [ schwarzschild ] . again writing @xmath43 it follows that for @xmath95 there is another constant @xmath96 for which @xmath97 . the constant is given by @xmath98 with @xmath99 the trajectories @xmath100 are radial null geodesics ( with non - zero expansion ) tangent to the  cosmological "" horizons . note that @xmath101 as @xmath102 and @xmath103 as @xmath104 . now define @xmath105 and @xmath106 trajectories with four tangents @xmath107 where @xmath108 and @xmath109 where @xmath27 is a constant , are radial null geodesics . now we find that the expansion is given by @xmath110 where @xmath111 the choice @xmath112 reproduces the bertotti - kasner result and the choice @xmath113 reproduces the schwarzschild vacuum result both for @xmath114 as given above . for @xmath95 these geodesics can be given explicitly in terms of elementary functions and are reproduced in appendix c. some details are shown in fig . [ schwarzdesitter ] . for @xmath116 there are no cosmological horizons but equations ( [ adef ] ) through ( [ fdef ] ) hold as given above . again the associated radial null geodesics can be given explicitly in terms of elementary functions and are reproduced in appendix d. some details are shown in fig . [ antidesitterimage ] . this section parallels ii but extends the construction to arbitrary dimensions ( @xmath118 ) . write @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the metric of a unit @xmath1 sphere . again @xmath3 is tangent to null geodesics affinely parameterized by @xmath10 but now the associated expansion is given by @xmath121 further , associated with the vector field @xmath18 we again have @xmath19 and @xmath122 but now the associated expansion is @xmath123 the trajectories for which all coordinates are constant except @xmath14 are radial null geodesics ( affinely parameterized by @xmath14 ) only for @xmath23 . finally , as before , if @xmath24 then @xmath124 is tangent to a radial null geodesic with @xmath10 again affine and the associated geodesics immediately follow as @xmath125 where @xmath27 is a constant . this section generalizes section iii above . for dimensions @xmath126 consider the spaces described by @xmath127 where the function @xmath128 is given by @xmath129 and @xmath54 signifies the function @xmath130 with @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) and @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) constants . it follows that @xcite @xmath131 @xmath132 and @xmath133 where @xmath134 again , the one independent invariant derivable from the riemmann tensor without differentiation can be taken to be ( [ weylscalargen ] ) and so with @xmath14 and @xmath10 extending over the reals , the spaces described by ( [ metricsgen ] ) are maximally extended and regular for @xmath53 ( and for all @xmath54 if @xmath135 , see below ) . in particular , note that @xmath136 again viewing @xmath28 as a constant of nature and @xmath33 a property of the vacuum , the specification of @xmath31 does not determine the physical situation uniquely . this is discussed below . in view of the generality of the cases considered , the formulae given are remarkably simple . consider the hyper - spherically symmetric spacetime @xmath137 note that @xmath54 is now a coordinate . it is not difficult to show that the unique form of @xmath60 which satisfies ( [ riccigen ] ) is given by @xmath138 where @xmath139 is a constant ( which we take @xmath140 ) . this solution was apparently first discussed by tangherlini @xcite . the coordinates are , of course , defective at @xmath141 , but the associated roots depend on @xmath0 and are not so easy to find from ( [ curvaturef ] ) . the previous construction circumvents this unnecessary algebra as follows : for ( [ curvature ] ) with ( [ curvaturef ] ) we find @xmath142 and so from ( [ weylscalargen ] ) and ( [ weylsqcurv ] ) ( assuming , without loss in generality , the same coordinates for @xmath120)we have the relation @xmath143 which gives @xmath144 only for @xmath145 . now substituting for @xmath139 from ( [ mrelation ] ) into ( [ curvaturef ] ) and writing an associated root to @xmath141 as @xmath42 we obtain ( [ lambdagen ] ) . in this way we never need to deal with ( [ curvaturef ] ) and so all dimensions @xmath118 are equally difficult to deal with as regards the location of horizons . the previous section raises the issue of  mass "" . in spacetime with @xmath89 the concept of mass in the spherically symmetric case is well established @xcite . the geometrical mass in @xmath146 dimensions for spaces admitting a @xmath147sphere has been defined previously by way of the sectional curvature @xcite . whereas this is merely a formal definition , it is of interest to compare this definition with @xmath33 and @xmath139 . in dimension @xmath0 define @xmath148 in the special case @xmath149 it follows that @xmath150 more generally , for @xmath151 , it follows that @xmath152 where @xmath28 is given by ( [ lambdagen ] ) . we can , of course , replace @xmath139 by @xmath33 in ( [ geomasslambda ] ) by solving for @xmath33 from ( [ mrelation ] ) . we now consider some specific cases . we define hyper - spherical de sitter space by the requirement @xmath135 so that from ( [ weylscalargen ] ) and ( [ weylsqcurv ] ) we have @xmath153 and so @xmath154 the metric follows as @xmath155 trajectories with four tangents @xmath156 are radial null geodesics ( so @xmath10 is affine for both radial null directions ) . we can write these geodesics in the form @xmath157 where @xmath27 is a constant . the negative cosmological horizons ( @xmath158 ) are then given by @xmath76 where the expansion @xmath77 ( @xmath159 ) vanishes . the associated diagram is qualitatively the same as fig . [ desitterfig ] . with @xmath160 we have hyper - spherical bertotti - kasner space . the metric simplifies to @xmath161 trajectories with four tangents @xmath162 are radial null geodesics ( so again @xmath10 is affine for both radial null directions ) and again @xmath82 . we can also write these geodesics in the form ( [ bertottigeo ] ) . asymptotically flat static vacuum black holes ( admitting the @xmath1 sphere ) are unique @xcite and given by the tangherlini generalization of the schwarzschild vacuum @xcite . in our notation these correspond to the case @xmath67 . global , regular and explicit coordinates for these spaces have been given previously @xcite . some further discussion is given in appendix e. more generally , the radial null geodesics that satisfy @xmath163 with @xmath128 given by ( [ fgen ] ) and @xmath54 by ( [ rfngen ] ) , are of interest . for these trajectories , excluding the cases discussed above , it is clear that @xmath61 as @xmath164 and @xmath64 as @xmath165 ( @xmath166 ) . from ( [ lambdagen ] ) , writing @xmath43 we have @xmath167 . in the range @xmath168 there is another constant @xmath169 for which @xmath170 . the trajectories @xmath171 are radial null geodesics and are tangent to the  cosmological "" horizons . it is also clear that for @xmath172 the solutions to ( [ othernullhigh ] ) evolve in a fundamentally different way as in the case @xmath145 . in fact , the qualitative behavior of all solutions to ( [ othernullhigh ] ) can be obtained without explicit integration . the essential conclusion is that the figures given for @xmath145 hold , qualitatively , for @xmath173 . this is discussed in detail elsewhere @xcite . a maximally extended , explicit and regular covering of the schwarzschild - de sitter vacua in arbitrary dimension ( @xmath126 ) has been given . it has bee stressed that these coordinates offer important advantages over the kruskal - szekeres procedure that include : an explicit representation of the line element that can be extended to arbitrary dimension , a simultaneous covering of both the black hole and cosmological horizons and derivation by direct integration of einstein s equations without recourse to coordinate transformations . in view of the generality of the problem solved , the resultant formulae obtained are of a remarkably simple form . part of this work was reported at the  the dark side of extra dimensions "" workshop held in may 2005 at the banff international research station ( birs ) , banff , alberta . it is a pleasure to thank werner israel and don page for comments and taylor binnington for drawing the figures . this work was supported by a grant from the natural sciences and engineering research council of canada and was made possible by use of _ grtensoriii _ @xcite . anti - de sitter space is not contained in ( [ metric ] ) with ( [ r(u , w ) ] ) but can be given in the form ( [ generalmetric ] ) with @xmath15 and is included here for completeness . it is given by @xmath174 where the constant @xmath175 . equations ( [ ricci ] ) and ( [ ricciscalar ] ) of course hold and the space is conformally flat . trajectories with four tangents @xmath176 are radial null geodesics so @xmath10 is again affine . we can write these geodesics in the form @xmath177 where @xmath27 is a constant . with @xmath14 and @xmath10 extending over the reals , ( [ antidesitter ] ) is maximally extended and regular . the degenerate schwarzschild - de sitter black hole has @xmath178 like the bertotti - kasner space but it is not contained in ( [ metric ] ) with ( [ r(u , w ) ] ) but can be given in the form ( [ generalmetric ] ) with @xmath15 and is included for completeness . coordinates for degenerate black holes are seldom discussed @xcite . now @xmath179 with @xmath180 in addition to the radial null geodesics given by constant @xmath14 and @xmath58 , the other radial null geodesics can be given by @xmath181 where @xmath182 is the lambert w function @xcite with @xmath183 and @xmath184 where @xmath27 is a constant . some details are shown in fig . [ degenschwarzdesitterimage ] . for @xmath95 the radial null geodesics with tangents @xmath114 can be given in a simple form : @xmath185 is a constant of motion where @xmath186 and    @xmath187      writing @xmath188 with @xmath189 the radial null geodesics with tangents @xmath114 can be given in the form    @xmath190    where @xmath27 is a constant . in the present notation we set @xmath67 and so have ( [ tangherlini ] ) with @xmath191 where @xmath192 with @xmath145 we recover ( [ schw ] ) . even implicit forms of @xmath54 in the kruskal - szekeres procedure are not known for for all @xmath0 ( _ e.g _ @xmath193 @xcite ) . however here we need only substitute for @xmath0 and insert ( [ rfn ] ) into ( [ tangherlinif ] ) to give a maximally extended , explicit and regular coverings of the space . for example , with @xmath194 we have @xmath195 solutions to ( [ othernull ] ) with ( [ tangherlinif ] ) and ( [ rfn ] ) can be given explicitly in terms of elementary functions in some cases . for example , with @xmath194 we have          m. d. kruskal , phys . 119 * , 1743 ( 1960 ) . g. szekeres , publ . debrecen * 7 * , 285 ( 1960 ) ( now available at general relativity and gravitation * 34 * , 2001 , ( 2002 ) ) . although usually obtained by way of coordinate transformations , the kruskal - szekeres coordinates can be obtained in an algorithmic way without guessing transformations . see , for example , k. lake in _ vth brazilian school of cosmology and gravitation _ edited by m. novello ( world scientific , singapore , 1987 ) . j. ehlers in _ relativity , astrophysics and cosmology . proceedings of the summer school held , 14 - 26 august , 1972 at the banff centre , banff , alberta _ edited by w. israel ( reidel , boston , 1973 ) . w. israel , phys . rev . * 143 * , 1016 ( 1966 ) . israel coordinates have been obtained independetly by d. w. pajerski and e. t. newman , j. math . * 12 * , 1929 ( 1971 ) and by t. klsch and t. strobl , class . * 13 * , 1191 ( 1996 ) arxiv:(gr - qc/9507011 ) . israel @xcite ( in the published form of his work ) introduced the coordinates by way of a transformation which , in his notation reads as @xmath197 . in this paper einstein s equations for vacua have been solved directly without prior coordinates . this is not possible for kruskal - szekeres coordinates wherein even at @xmath145 with @xmath198 the vacuum field equations are difficult to solve . see , for example , lake @xcite . we use einstein s equations ( with cosmological constant ) , geometrical units and a signature of @xmath1 . the sign conventions for @xmath10 and @xmath14 is that @xmath10 can decrease and @xmath14 increase only in spacelike directions . for convenience , explicit functional dependence is usually shown only on the first appearance of a function . but see k. lake , phys . d * 20 * , 370 ( 1979 ) , j. podolsky , gen . . grav . * 31 * , 1703 ( 1999 ) arxiv : gr - qc/9910029 , s. gao , phys . d * 68 * , 044028 ( 2003 ) arxiv:(gr - qc/0207029 ) and r. balbinot , s. fagnocchi , a. fabbri , s. farese and j. navarro - salas , phys . d * 70 * , 064031 ( 2004 ) arxiv:(hep - th/0405263 ) for a detailed discussion see w. rindler , physics letters a * 245 * , 363 ( 1998 ) . this is defined by @xmath199 . see , for example , r. m. corless , g. h. gonnet , d. e. g. hare , d. j. jeffrey , and d. e. knuth , advances in computational mathematics * 5 * , 329 ( 1996 ) . if the cosmological constant @xmath200 is defined ( in dimension @xmath0 ) by the vacuum field equations @xmath201 where @xmath202 is the @xmath0 dimensional einstein tensor , then @xmath203 . f. r. tangherlini , nuovo cimento * 27 * , 636 ( 1963 ) . see , for example , w. c. hernandez and c. w. misner , astrophys . j. * 143 * , 452 ( 1966 ) , m. e. cahill and g. c. mcvittie , j. math . phys , 11 , * 1360 * ( 1970 ) , e. poisson and w. israel , phys . rev d * 41 * , 1796 ( 1990 ) , t. zannias , phys . d * 41 * , 3252 ( 1990 ) and s. hayward , phys . d * 53 * , 1938 ( 1996 ) arxiv:(gr - qc/9408002 ) k. lake , arxiv:(gr - qc/0606005 ) s. hwang , geometriae dedicata * 71 * , 5 ( 1998 ) , g. w. gibbons , d. ida and t. shiromizu , prog . phys . suppl . * 148 * , 284 ( 2003 ) arxiv:(gr - qc/0203004 ) . k. lake , j. cosmol . jcap * 10 * 007 ( 2003 ) arxiv:(gr - qc/0306073 ) k. lake ( in preparation ) . this is a package which runs within maple . it is entirely distinct from packages distributed with maple and must be obtained independently . the grtensorii software and documentation is distributed freely on the world - wide - web from the address _ http://grtensor.org _ grtensoriii software is in development .","The text discusses the maximally extended and regular covering of the Schwarzschild vacuum in four dimensions, which is a fundamental concept in general relativity.

"in the standard electroweak theory , flavor - changing neutral current ( fcnc ) processes are strongly suppressed and can only occur via higher - order effects . hence , these processes will be sensitive to unknown particles or interactions that contribute in higher - order loop diagrams . such processes are ideal places to look for signals of new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .    in the sm , the fcnc @xmath0 decay is predominantly a cp conserving process . its branching fraction is sensitive to the real part of the @xmath10 transition amplitude , while the related decays @xmath11 and @xmath12 sense the imaginary part and absolute value , respectively . like these decays , @xmath0 is theoretically clean and uncertainties in the hadronic matrix element can be removed by using the measured branching fraction of its relevant semileptonic decay @xmath13 . the sm predicts the branching fraction to be @xmath14 @xcite . although the prediction is solid in the sm , there is a possibility of enhancements from new physics contributions . in fact , phenomenological analyses give constraints on possible enhancements by up to an order of magnitude within the allowed range of new physics parameters from known kaon decays , including the measured branching fraction of @xmath12 @xcite . in addition , a new particle @xmath8 which decays into invisible particles , can also contribute to the three body decay @xmath15 . there is also a possibility of having new pseudoscalar particles , as predicted by several supersymmetry models . searches for the @xmath16 or @xmath17 modes and comparisons with the models have been made @xcite , and similar test should also be tried in the @xmath18 final state .    the e391a experiment at the kek 12-gev proton synchrotron made the first search for the @xmath0 decay , based on the data sample taken in the first stage ( run - i ) . an upper limit on the branching fraction of 4.7@xmath7 at the 90% confidence level ( c.l . ) for @xmath19 was obtained @xcite . unfortunately the run - i data were compromised by large neutron backgrounds from a vacuum membrane that hung in the beam . this article is based on the e391a data taken in the periods from february to april in 2005 ( run - ii ) and from november to december in 2005 ( run - iii ) , after correcting the problem . these data had six times more @xmath2 decays and were analyzed with improved methods . the e391a detector was primarily designed to search for the @xmath20 decay @xcite . it had a csi calorimeter to detect two photons from a @xmath21 decay and hermetic veto counters to ensure that no other visible particles existed in the final state ( fig . [ fig : detector ] ) . to avoid backgrounds from interactions of the beam particles with air , most of the detector components were placed in a vacuum vessel . the csi calorimeter consisted of 496 blocks of @xmath22 @xmath23 undoped csi crystal . a @xmath24 @xmath25 beam hole was located at the center of the calorimeter to allow the beam particles to pass through . the main barrel ( mb ) and front barrel ( fb ) counters were sandwiches of lead plates and plastic - scintillation counters with 13.5 @xmath26 and 17.5 @xmath26 , respectively , and formed cylindrical walls surrounding the @xmath27 decay volume . collar shaped counters ( cc00 , cc02@xmath2807 ) were placed around the beam line for vetoing photons along the beam axis . charged particles that would hit the csi calorimeter were identified and rejected by energy deposits in a charge veto ( cv ) scintillation - counter hodoscope , located 50 cm upstream ; it covered the front face as well as the outer wall of the beam - hole area . beam - hole charge veto ( bhcv ) and back - anti ( ba ) counters were located in the downstream region along the beam axis and outside of the vacuum vessel . the bhcv consisted of eight 3-mm - thick plastic - scintillation counters , which were arranged to fully cover the downstream area of the beam hole . the ba was made of six superlayers , each consisting of a lead / scintillator sandwich and quartz blocks for run - ii . for run - iii the ba had five superlayers , where the lead / scintillator sandwich part was replaced by the lead tungsten oxide ( pwo ) crystals ; this change was the only difference in the e391a detector system between the run - ii and run - iii periods . data acquisition was made with a hardware trigger that required two or more electromagnetic showers in the csi calorimeter with total energy @xmath29 60 mev , and no obvious activity in the cv and other veto counters . loose on - line veto requirements were imposed , which ensured flexibility of setting energy thresholds consistently for the real data and the detector simulation during the off - line analysis . the @xmath30 decay should produce exactly four showers in the csi calorimeter and nothing else in all the other counters . these hits should also satisfy an in - time requirement to suppress backgrounds . the experimental signature of @xmath0 is four photons in the final states with a non - zero missing mass and a transverse momentum . photons were registered in the csi calorimeter as energy deposits in adjacent blocks ( clusters ) . the most probable hit position of the photon was obtained from the shower energy distribution among the csi blocks . events with four photon clusters in the csi were selected for further off - line processing . reconstruction of a pair of photons was made by assuming that they were from a @xmath21 that decayed on the beam axis ( @xmath31-axis ) . multiple pairings of four photons to reconstruct two @xmath21s were eliminated by taking the combination that gave the minimum @xmath32 value in the difference in @xmath31 vertices . a cut on the minimum @xmath32 for the common @xmath31 vertex @xmath33 was effective for good @xmath21 identification . also , requiring a large difference in the lowest two @xmath32 values was effective in reducing the combinatorial error . we required that the common @xmath21-decay vertex point @xmath33 should be in the decay volume 300 cm @xmath34 500 cm . the veto conditions on the mb , cv , and collar counters were carefully tuned . among these counters , the mb played a major role in vetoing photons undetected by the csi calorimeter . if too low an energy - threshold was imposed for all of the mb counters , back - splash from the csi / cv surface and electromagnetic shower leakage from the outer part of the csi calorimeter to the downstream area of the mb would cause acceptance loss . thus , we applied a tighter threshold to the upstream region of the mb to detect photons with a high efficiency , and a looser threshold to the downstream region of the mb to keep a large acceptance for the signal @xcite . suppression of the fusion cluster ( misidentification of two close - by clusters as one cluster ) was made by using the neural network ( nn ) technique trained by the stand - alone photons and the fusion clusters from the @xmath35 monte carlo ( mc ) simulation sample . further suppression was made on the shower shape of the cluster , and by examining the energy distribution and its rms fraction @xcite .

[ fig : mcdata](a ) . the signal region was defined as a right triangular area shown in fig . [ fig : mcdata ] . the vertical edge of the triangle is located at the lower bound of the @xmath37 effective mass ( 0.268 gev/@xmath9 ) , and spanned the @xmath40 values between 0.1 to 0.2 gev/@xmath42 . the horizontal edge defined the lower bound of @xmath40 ( 0.1 gev/@xmath42 ) to avoid contamination from the @xmath43 decay ; it spanned the @xmath36 values between 0.268 to 0.450 gev/@xmath9 . the detector acceptance was calculated by taking the ratio of the number of events in the signal region to the number of @xmath2 particles that decayed in the fiducial vertex region . a list of the reduction factors that contributed to the acceptance after the @xmath2s decayed in the fiducial volume are summarized in table  [ tab : reduction ] . the acceptances obtained for run - ii and run - iii were consistent , and the result was @xmath44 for each run period . lcl cuts & reduction & resultant + & factor & acceptance + @xmath27 decay in the fiducial volume & & 1.00 + + hardware trigger & four - cluster- & & +  candidate in the csi calorimeter & 0.0499 & @xmath45 + + tighter csi fiducial & 0.616 & @xmath46 + + rejection of fused cluster & 0.361 & @xmath47 + + req . good cluster & 0.295 & @xmath48 + + @xmath32 cut for two @xmath21 vertex matching & 0.606 & @xmath49 + + other misc . requirements on csi & 0.829 & @xmath50 + + mb and upstream vetoes & 0.621 & @xmath51 + + downstream vetoes & 0.853 & @xmath52 + + req . signal box ( after all the cuts ) & 0.346 & @xmath53 +    to study the dominant backgrounds , mc events of the @xmath54 decay with the statistics equivalent to 11.2 and 11.9 times the run - ii and run - iii data , and the @xmath43 decay equivalent to 0.80 and 2.52 times the run - ii and run - iii data , respectively , were generated with the same detector conditions as the real data . within these statistics , no mc events of these processes were found in the @xmath55 signal region for both the run - ii and run - iii conditions . the mc results of the @xmath54 and @xmath43 decays for the run - iii condition , with the same statistics as the real data , are shown in figs . [ fig : mcdata](b ) and ( c ) , respectively , together with the run - iii real data ( fig . [ fig : mcdata](d ) ) . the @xmath54 plot of @xmath40 vs.  @xmath36 showed clear clustering well removed from the signal region of @xmath0 ( fig .

[ fig : mcdata](d ) ) outside of the masked signal region was characterized by the sum of fig . [ fig : mcdata](b ) and ( c ) , except for a small number of events that extended to higher @xmath40 from the @xmath56 cluster region . these latter events are considered to be due to @xmath57 regeneration in the detector , and are not simulated in the mc . they will be discussed in sec . the mc study showed that most events stayed close to the signal region except that those for @xmath58 were from @xmath54 and @xmath43 decays . the main background source was @xmath43 . the number of @xmath27 particles that decayed in the fiducial vertex region was estimated by detecting @xmath59 with the same @xmath21 selection criteria in the csi calorimeter as for @xmath60 . comparison with the mc simulation of @xmath61 , with the same @xmath21 selection criteria as the real data , along with overlaid accidental events , gave the number of @xmath27 decays as @xmath62 for run - ii and @xmath63 for run - iii , respectively .    to estimate the systematic uncertainties , the fractional difference between the data and the mc simulation in each selection criteria was examined , and the quadratic sum weighted by the effectiveness of each of the acceptance determinations @xcite was taken . the calculated values were 5.6% and 5.5% for run - ii and run - iii , respectively . the same values of the systematic uncertainty were adopted to the @xmath19 decay .    based on the acceptance for the @xmath19 decay obtained from the mc simulation , and the number of @xmath2 decays in the data - taking runs , the single event sensitivity ( s.e.s ) was defined as @xmath64 the s.e.s . was derived as @xmath65 for run - ii and @xmath66 for run - iii . the combined s.e.s . was @xmath67 . the sensitivity reported here is considerably improved from that of our previous analysis @xcite . in addition to the six - times larger statistics , the acceptance factor was improved for several selection criteria . examples include the adoption of a looser cut for @xmath32 in the two-@xmath21 vertex matching , and optimizing the criteria used to select good photon clusters in the csi calorimeter , both of which were possible in a cleaner environment with less neutron background in run - ii and run - iii .     vs. @xmath36 for the bifurcation analysis.,height=204 ] lrrrrrrr region & @xmath68 & @xmath69 & @xmath70 & est . @xmath71 & @xmath72 + signal & 3 & 381 & 2508 & 0.46@xmath730.26 &  + low @xmath40 & 136 & 6330 & 41418 & 20.8@xmath731.8 & 21 & + 2nd low @xmath40 & 1151 & 17525 & 105455 & 191.3@xmath735.9 & 229 + high @xmath40 & 0 & 110 & 604 & 0.0 & 1 + 2nd high @xmath40 & 1 & 5 & 41 & 0.12@xmath730.13 & 0 + high mass & 6 & 283 & 1086 & 1.56@xmath730.65 & 12 + a  blind analysis "" technique was used to minimize the contribution from backgrounds without examining the candidate events in the signal region . among the background sources , @xmath38 was fully reconstructed and rejected primarily by kinematic variables ( @xmath40 , @xmath36 ) of the @xmath37 system . however , @xmath74 would become a background if two photons were missed due to finite photon - veto inefficiencies in the detector . the kinematic cuts could not be applicable to this dominant background source , and suppression depended strongly on the photon veto conditions . to avoid the difficulty of having enough statistics in the mc simulation of the @xmath43 background in the signal region , we adopted the  bifurcation method "" to estimate the number of background events in the signal region from the real data @xcite . we imposed several selection criteria ( cuts ) to identify the @xmath75 signal from backgrounds , and the roles of these cuts were categorized in two groups , namely cut @xmath76 and cut @xmath77 . the cut @xmath76 consisted of  veto "" requirements to ensure no particles other than from the csi - calorimeter region , and the cut @xmath77 consisted of the cuts to select well - reconstructed @xmath21s from pairs of photon clusters in the calorimeter . if the two categories of cuts are uncorrelated , the number of events that passed both of the cuts @xmath76 and @xmath77 would be described as @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the number of events after the basic  setup cuts "" are imposed prior to the cuts @xmath76 and @xmath77 , and @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 are the probability of passing the conditions @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath83 , respectively . the number of estimated background events @xmath71 is derived as @xmath84 where the symbols @xmath85 and @xmath86 are the inverse logic of @xmath76 and @xmath77 , respectively . thus @xmath71 in the signal region after imposing all of the cuts @xmath76 and @xmath77 could be estimated from the number of events obtained by the combination of @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 . the kinematic region defined by @xmath40 and @xmath36 of the @xmath37 system was further divided into six as shown in fig .

[ fig : mcdata](d ) with @xmath36 around @xmath96 , extending to the higher @xmath40 region ( @xmath970.1 gev/@xmath42 ) . [ fig : propertime ] shows the proper - time distribution of the @xmath37 system with @xmath98 0.1 gev/@xmath42 , @xmath99 0.55 gev/@xmath9 , and a looser @xmath33 requirement for the run - ii and run - iii combined , assuming that the production point was the downstream edge of the cc02 counter . the proper - time distribution ( fig . [ fig : propertime ] ) is consistent with that of expected from the @xmath100 decay , implying that the events are from regeneration of @xmath57 in the upstream materials and subsequent @xmath37 decay .    because the final state of the @xmath101 process was fully reconstructed , these events were insensitive to the photon - veto cuts ( cuts @xmath76 ) and also to the csi cluster shape cuts ( cuts @xmath77 ) . hence the bifurcation method was not applicable for estimating the backgrounds from this process . nevertheless , these events might occur in the signal region by a mis - pairing of the photons from the @xmath21s . assuming that the mis - pairing rate for @xmath100 decays was equal to that for @xmath38 decays shown in fig .

"increasing disorder is known to suppress superconductivity in low - dimensional systems such as thin films and narrow wires@xcite . this occurs because the disorder causes electrons to move diffusively rather than ballistically , making them less efficient at screening the coulomb repulsion between electrons . the increased coulomb repulsion decreases both the electron - electron attraction needed for superconductivity , and the density of states of electrons available for pairing at the fermi surface@xcite . typical types of experimental data are : ( i ) @xmath4 , the transition temperature as a function of normal state resistance per square@xcite ; ( ii ) @xmath5 , the order parameter at zero temperature , as a function of normal state resistance per square@xcite ; ( iii ) @xmath6 , the upper critical field as a function of temperature and normal state resistance per square@xcite ; ( iv ) @xmath7 , transition temperature as a function of resistance per square and spin - flip scattering rate in films with magnetic impurities.@xcite it is found experimentally that @xmath4 curves from a wide variety of materials fit a universal curve with a single fitting parameter , whilst the few experimental measurements of @xmath8 , seem to have @xmath9 roughly constant@xcite . this fitting to a single curve , whilst pleasing in showing that the basic ingredients of our theories are correct , does not allow detailed analysis of the theory . data of types ( iii ) and ( iv ) are more promising because there is an additional parameter to vary  the magnetic field in ( iii ) , and spin - flip scattering rate in ( iv ) . to the best of our knowledge , only one experiment of type ( iv ) has been performed@xcite , and we discuss it elsewhere.@xcite several experiments of type ( iii ) have been performed@xcite ; some seem to show a positive curvature in @xmath0 at low temperature as disorder is increased . moreover this effect is predicted by theory@xcite , and this seems to be another confirmation of the basic theoretical model . however , we need to be careful : positive curvature in @xmath0 is a ubiquitous feature of exotic superconductors@xcite , and occurs in many systems where localization is not believed to be the cause . indeed any pair - breaking mechanism that varies as a function of magnetic field can lead to such anomalous behaviour in @xmath2 . this means that it is often difficult to distinguish between the various mechanisms that might be present . it is therefore particularly important to be sure of our theory , and in this light we re - examine the predictions of localization theory . one of the main problems of the localization theory is that even first - order perturbation theory results are hard to obtain correctly . the first - order results are capable of explaining experimental data in the weak disorder regime , but for stronger disorder it is clear that we need something else . as an example consider the prediction for @xmath10 suppression@xcite , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is transition temperature for clean system , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is the elastic scattering time . this yields an exponential curve for @xmath4 , which behaves like a straight line for small @xmath1 . it is clear that @xmath10 deduced from this equation can never go to zero for finite @xmath1 , as happens in experiment . a very simple ad hoc way of going beyond simple perturbation theory is to replace @xmath12 on the right hand side by @xmath10 , pleading perhaps to self - consistency . if we define @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 , the new equation has the cubic form @xmath18 and can easily be solved . however a new problem emerges because there are two positive roots for every value of @xmath1 . at first we can take the larger of the roots , on physical principles , because it is this root which tends to @xmath19 at @xmath20 . however we eventually come to a re - entrance point beyond which no solutions exist . it is clear that this re - entrance is unphysical , an artefact of our ad hoc extension of perturbation theory . in the case of @xmath4 the story has a happy ending in that perturbation theory can be correctly extended by a renormalization group ( rg ) treatment based on finkelstein s interacting non - linear sigma model@xcite . this leads to the result @xmath21 where @xmath22 . this equation reduces to the first - order result for small @xmath23 and now @xmath10 goes smoothly to zero at @xmath24 . the three curves are plotted for comparison in fig . the reason for discussing @xmath4 in detail above is that the same problem occurs for @xmath6 . the standard theory in this case@xcite , due to maekawa , ebisawa and fukuyama ( mef ) is the equivalent of the ad hoc extension discussed above , and has the form @xmath25\right)-r_{hf}-r_v \nonumber\\ r_{hf}&=&\displaystyle-{1\over 2}t\ln^2{\left({1\over 2\pi t_c\tau}\right ) } -t\ln{\left({1\over 2\pi t_c\tau}\right ) } \left[\psi\left({1\over 2}\right ) -\psi\left({1\over 2}+{1\over 2\pi t_c\tau_h}\right)\right]\nonumber\\ r_v&=&\displaystyle-{1\over 3}t\ln^3{\left({1\over 2\pi t_c\tau}\right ) } -t\ln^2{\left({1\over 2\pi t_c\tau}\right ) } \left[\psi\left({1\over 2}\right ) -\psi\left({1\over 2}+{1\over 2\pi t_c\tau_h}\right)\right],\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath26 . this equation suffers similar re - entrance problems at finite @xmath27 to those found at @xmath28 , when it is just the @xmath10 equation . indeed the @xmath0 curves can only be plotted down to the value of @xmath3 at which re - entrance occurs , and at this point the curves appear to have infinite slope . this leads to us asking the question of whether the positive curvature in @xmath0 is also an artefact of the ad hoc approximation used . what we need to answer this question is the finite magnetic field analogue of the rg result discussed above . however the rg is very difficult , and the answer is not forthcoming from this source . fortunately oreg and finkelstein@xcite have recently shown that the rg result can be obtained from a diagrammatic resummation technique . this method has the great advantage of being analytically tractable and easy to use . in this paper we extend this approach to finite magnetic field to see whether we really do expect positive curvature in @xmath0 . indeed this paper is intended as somewhat of a showcase for this resummation method , to demonstrate the ease of its extension to a wide variety of problems . oreg and finkelstein@xcite take the coulomb interaction to be featureless , and we shall follow them . we should therefore explain why it is legitimate to use a featureless interaction rather than the correct screened coulomb interaction . the screened coulomb interaction has a singularity at low momentum , and one might naively think that this would lead to a strong enhancement of the suppression of transition temperature . however a cancellation occurs between diagrams 14 and diagram 5 of fig . 2 , which effectively removes the low momentum singularity@xcite . the coulomb interaction is then effectively featureless , all diagrammatic sums being dominated by large frequency and momentum . it turns out that one gets the same result from doing the perturbation theory correctly with the screened coulomb interaction as from using a constant interaction of strength @xmath29 and keeping only diagrams 14 . this is what we shall do in this paper . we also note that the re - summation method of oreg and finkelstein@xcite keeps only diagrams 3 and 4 , which is again legitimate as their contribution is greater than that from diagrams 1 and 2 . however it is not difficult to include these terms in the re - summation , as we will show in section . the cancellation of low momentum singularities is expected to be a general feature , enforced by gauge invariance , so we are free to ignore them and use a featureless interaction as long as we include the diagrams that give the dominant contribution at large frequency and momentum . the outline of the rest of the paper is as follows . in section we review the first - order perturbation calculation for @xmath0 assuming a featureless coulomb interaction . we derive the analytical mef formula by making an asymptotic approximation to the matsubara frequency sums which arise in perturbation theory . we make plots of @xmath0 both by solving the implicit mef equation , and its equivalent where the matsubara sums are performed exactly . surprisingly we find no positive curvature in the latter case . in section we derive @xmath0 using the resummation technique both in the form used by oreg and finkelstein , and also in an extended form which includes self - energy diagrams missed in their formalism . again we find no positive curvature in @xmath0 . in section we discuss the experimental situation and draw conclusions . in this section we will carefully review the first - order perturbation theory calculation@xcite of @xmath0 . we do this in detail because we will show that accurately performing sums rather than making an analytical approximation to them removes the upward curvature in @xmath0 . we identify @xmath10 as the temperature at which the magnetic field dependent pair propagator diverges . to find the latter we calculate the correction to the momentum - dependent pair propagator , @xmath30 , and then make the usual substitution @xmath31 , where @xmath26 . the zeroth - order ( mean field ) pair propagator is given by @xmath32\ ] ] so that upon substitution @xmath31 we get the usual abrikosov - gorkov result@xcite for the pair - breaking effect of the magnetic field @xmath33 we will calculate the corrections to the pair polarization bubble , @xmath34 , which will lead to a change in @xmath10 given by @xmath35 since we will assume a featureless interaction , we need to evaluate diagrams 1 to 4 of fig . diagrams 1 and 3 involve the summation of three terms to form a hikami box@xcite , the general form for which is @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 , the @xmath39 being the incoming momenta , and the @xmath40 the matsubara frequencies on the electron green functions in the box . using standard diagrammatic rules , and the above result for the hikami box , we obtain the 4 contributions to the pair polarization bubble @xmath41 we note that the relative signs of @xmath42 and @xmath43 are irrelevant in the sum , since the summand depends only upon @xmath44 and @xmath45 , and that the featurelessness of the potential allows us to shift the momentum sum in terms 2 and 4 . we find that terms 1 and 2 partially cancel , whilst terms 3 and 4 reinforce , to yield the sum @xmath46[\epsilon_l+\epsilon_n]}+ { 1\over[\epsilon_l+1/\tau_h][\epsilon_n+1/\tau_h ] } \left[\ln{\left({1\over[\epsilon_l+\epsilon_n]\tau}\right ) } + { 1\over[\epsilon_l+\epsilon_n]\tau_h}\right]\right\}\ ] ] where @xmath47 and we have performed the @xmath48-sum and set @xmath31 .    we first reproduce mef s analytic approximation to the sums over matsubara frequencies . to do this it turns out to be easier to make a choice of relative sign of matsubara frequencies , @xmath49 , and to set @xmath50 . if @xmath51 and @xmath52 , the sum becomes @xmath53m}+ { 1\over[l+1/2+\alpha][m - l-1/2+\alpha ] } \left[\ln{\left({m\over m}\right)}+{\alpha\over m}\right ] \right\}\nonumber\\ & = & \displaystyle-{g\over 4\pi^2d}\sum_{m=1}^{m } \left[\psi\left({1\over 2}+m+\alpha\right ) -\psi\left({1\over 2}+\alpha\right)\right ] \left\{{1\over m}+{2\over ( m+2\alpha)}\left[\ln{\left({m\over m}\right ) } + { \alpha\over m}\right]\right\}\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath54 , @xmath55 . if we first evaluate the sum for @xmath56 , we see that it will be dominated by large @xmath57 , so we replace the difference of digamma functions by @xmath58 , and the sum over @xmath57 by an integral to get @xmath59.\ ] ] to evaluate the result for finite @xmath60 we subtract off the @xmath56 result and try to analytically approximate the difference . again we expect the sum to be dominated by large @xmath57 , so we can ignore the @xmath60 in @xmath61 and @xmath62 , and ignore the term proportional to @xmath60 as it is less divergent . the difference then has the form @xmath63 \left\{{1\over m}+ { 2\over m}\ln{\left({m\over m}\right)}\right\}\nonumber\\ & = & \displaystyle-{g\over 4\pi^2d } \left[\psi\left({1\over 2}\right)-\psi\left({1\over 2}+\alpha\right)\right ] \left\{\ln{\left({1\over 2\pi t_c\tau}\right)}+ \ln^2{\left({1\over 2\pi t_c\tau}\right)}\right\}\end{aligned}\ ] ] from our knowledge of the calculation which includes the full screened coulomb interaction we know that we should set @xmath64 , from which it follows that @xmath65 . putting the eqns . ( [ mefpapprox ] ) and ( [ mfpapprox ] ) into eqn . ( [ tch ] ) yields the mef formula cited in eqn . ( [ mef ] ) . it turns out that this approximation , although apparently reasonable , is not justified . if we plot the values of @xmath66 calculated by performing the sums directly , we find that they do not agree with eqn . ( [ mef ] ) . consequently the @xmath0 curves predicted by the analytic approximation and exact sum are also different .    0.25truein    on the left side of fig . 3 we display @xmath0 predicted by the mef result of eqn . ( [ mef ] ) for several values of @xmath1 in the case where @xmath67 . we clearly see the positive curvature at low temperature , and the result that the curves all terminate at finite @xmath3 due to re - entrance problems . on the right side of fig . 3 we plot @xmath0 deduced directly from the first - order perturbation theory result of eqn . ( [ passum ] ) . we note that since the answers we get depend upon the logarithm of the upper cut - off , if we treat the upper cut - off differently , we will get slightly different answers . however , this difference will always be lost in fitting to experiment since we determine the unknown upper cut - off parameter from the initial slope of the data . the reason we mention this is that the exact sums can be performed in two slightly different ways : we can have the sum over @xmath42 and @xmath68 , or the sum over @xmath42 and @xmath43 , the cut - offs in each case being taken at @xmath69 . the results are slightly different due to different treatment of the upper cut - off . however in both cases we find no positive curvature in @xmath0 . there is still the problem that the curves finish at finite @xmath3 because of re - entrance , and this tells us that the ad hoc prescription being used to go beyond first - order perturbation theory is still inadequate . but again we stress the key point of this section : even within the ad hoc extension of first - order perturbation theory , we do not get positive curvature in @xmath0 if we do the matsubara sums exactly . in this section we answer the question of what is the correct way to go beyond first - order perturbation theory . to do this , we extend a resummation technique recently developed by oreg and finkelstein@xcite ( of ) . this involves calculating the pair scattering amplitude , @xmath70 , and identifying @xmath10 as the temperature at which it first diverges . the ladder summation involved is shown diagrammatically in fig . 4 this is actually an extended version of the of approach because as well as considering diagrams 3 and 4 of fig .  2 , which correspond to an effective coulomb pseudopotential , and end up in the block @xmath71 , we also consider diagrams 1 and 2 of fig .  2 , which correspond to an effective self - energy , and end up in the block @xmath72 which renormalises the cooperon impurity ladder . in fact we will consider both versions of the summation technique : the simpler one involves using the bare cooperon @xmath73 rather than the dressed one @xmath74 . of demonstrate that the matrix equation they obtain in 2d can be approximated by a parquet - like differential equation that turns out to be identical to that obtained from renormalization group analysis . instead of generating a continuous approximation to the matrix equation , we simply solve the equation and change the temperature ( which affects the upper cut - off @xmath55 ) until we find the first zero eigenvalue of the matrix , at which point it has become singular , and we have reached @xmath10 . numerically this involves diagonalizing matrices of rank less than 2000 or so . let us now proceed to the calculation of the pair amplitude matrix @xmath75 . if we evaluate the diagrams of fig .  4 , but ignore the magnetic field and self - energy correction to the cooperon , we obtain the same equation as of , @xmath76 { 1\over |\epsilon_m|}\gamma(\epsilon_m,\epsilon_l)\ ] ] except that we have explicitly kept both positive and negative matsubara frequencies because the expression for @xmath77 will turn out to depend upon whether its two matsubara frequencies have the same or opposite sign . this is a reflection of the breaking of time - reversal invariance caused by the magnetic field . let us first see how to solve the above equation , and then later put in the magnetic field , and the correction to the cooperon . as a matrix equation , it takes the form @xmath78{\hat\epsilon}^{-1}{\hat\gamma}\ ] ] where @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 . this has the solution @xmath83 where @xmath84{\hat\epsilon}^{-1/2}\ ] ] and @xmath85 is the identity matrix . it follows that when the matrix @xmath86 has an eigenvalue equal to @xmath87 , the pair amplitude diverges , and we have found @xmath10 . our approach is therefore to start at the mean field transition temperature , @xmath12 , and decrease temperature until one of the eigenvalues of @xmath88 changes sign . the matrix @xmath89 depends upon @xmath3 both through the dependence of @xmath90 upon @xmath3 and through its rank @xmath91 , where @xmath92 . we start at the mean - field value of @xmath93 , which we will call @xmath94 , and decrease the temperature by increasing @xmath93 successively by one . we diagonalize the matrix @xmath95 for each value of @xmath93 until an eigenvalue changes sign . at this point we have found @xmath10 for the given problem , and @xmath96 . we can then change a parameter such as @xmath23 or @xmath60 and repeat the procedure . this removes the need for any perturbative expansion . let us now put back in the magnetic field and cooperon self - energy corrections . the @xmath97 denominator in the eqn . ( [ of ] ) comes from the cooperon @xmath98 and in the presence of a magnetic field , @xmath97 is replaced by @xmath99 , and hence @xmath100 , where @xmath101 . the contributions to @xmath71 from the diagrams of fig .  4 which correspond to diagrams 3 and 4 of fig . 2 are given by @xmath102}\theta(-\epsilon_n\epsilon_m)\nonumber\\ t\lambda_4(\epsilon_n,\epsilon_m)&=&\displaystyle { g\over\pi n(0)}\sum_{q'}{1\over [ dq'^2+|\epsilon_n|+|\epsilon_m| ] } \theta(\epsilon_n\epsilon_m)\end{aligned}\ ] ] and so performing the @xmath48-sum and setting @xmath31 gives @xmath103 } & \quad$\epsilon_n\epsilon_m>0$\cr \displaystyle\ln{\left[{1\over ( |\epsilon_n|+|\epsilon_m|)\tau}\right ] } + { 2\over ( |\epsilon_n|+|\epsilon_m|)\tau_h}&\quad $ \epsilon_n\epsilon_m<0$\cr}\ ] ] it follows that the matrix elements of @xmath90 are @xmath104    to include the self - energy correction into the cooperon , we note that the corrected cooperon is given by @xmath105^{-1}= { 1\over 2\pi n(0)\tau^2}\displaystyle \left[dq^2 + 2|\epsilon_m|-{1\over 2\pi n(0)\tau^2}\sigma\right]^{-1}\ ] ] so that we need to absorb a factor @xmath106 into @xmath72 . the contributions from the diagrams of fig .  4 which correspond to diagrams 1 and 2 of fig .  2 are @xmath107\theta(-\epsilon_n\epsilon_m ) \nonumber\\ \sigma_2(\epsilon_n)&=&\displaystyle-{2g\over n(0)}t\sum_{\epsilon_m}\sum_{q ' } { 1\over ( dq'^2+|\epsilon_n|+|\epsilon_m|)}\theta(\epsilon_n\epsilon_m)\end{aligned}\ ] ] which partially cancel to give the result @xmath108\ ] ] the weak - localization contribution to the cooperon self - energy is given by @xmath109\ ] ] incorporating @xmath72 into the cooperon means that @xmath110 has elements @xmath111 -2\alpha t\ln{\left({m\over n+1/2}\right)}\right\}\delta_{nm}\ ] ] using the new formulas for @xmath110 and @xmath90 , we now plot @xmath0 for various values of @xmath17 . the results are shown in fig .  5 : the plot on the left does not include self - energy corrections ; the plot on the right does . the results are very similar and show no sign of upward curvature in @xmath0 . we note that there are no re - entrance problems in our calculation of @xmath10 : we can plot the curves down to as low a temperature as we like if we are prepared to diagonalize large enough matrices .    0.25truein the central message of the paper is that the theory of localization and interaction does not predict an anomalous positive curvature in the upper critical field @xmath0 of thin film superconductors . a subsidiary message is that the resummation method developed by oreg and finkelstein@xcite is a very powerful and adaptable tool for going beyond perturbation theory in disordered superconductors . we suspected that the positive curvature in @xmath0 was an artefact related to the re - entrance problem found in @xmath4 , and that it would not survive a systematic non - perturbative treatment . the latter is true , but the cause of the positive curvature artefact turns out to be an incorrect analytic approximation to sums of matsubara frequencies . we will now consider the experimental situation by attempting to fit experimental data to both the mef formula of eqn . ( [ mef ] ) , and the exact first - order perturbation theory result of eqn . ( [ passum ] ) . the data which fits best to the localization theory is that of graybeal and beasley@xcite on amorphous films of mo - ge , because values of @xmath10 for all films can be obtained by choosing a single value of the parameter @xmath16 . the fits in fig . 6 used the parameter value @xmath112 for the mef curves and @xmath113 for the exact sum curves . values of @xmath114 and @xmath115koe were taken directly from the data . the experimental data appears to fit better to the exact sum curves than the mef curves , and there seems little sign of an upward curvature in @xmath0 . when the same procedure is applied to the data of okuma et al@xcite on zn films , we find that we need to use different values of @xmath116 for the two films to get the correct @xmath10 for given @xmath1 . the plots in fig .  7 use values @xmath117 for the @xmath118 film and @xmath119 for the @xmath120 film for the mef formula ; @xmath121 for the @xmath118 film and @xmath122 for the @xmath120 film for the exact sum formula . both films have the same thickness of @xmath123 , but different resistances , and hence different diffusion constants @xmath124 . the latter were calculated using the material parameters for zn to get values of @xmath125 for zero - resistance films of the same composition equal to 5.08koe for the @xmath118 film and 7.62koe for @xmath120 film . @xmath12 was taken to be @xmath126 . again the data seems to fit better to the exact sum curves than the mef formula . to fit the data of hebard and paalanen@xcite on amorphous in - ino@xmath127 films again requires a different value of @xmath116 for each film . the plots in fig . 8 use @xmath128 for the @xmath129 film and @xmath130 for the @xmath131 and @xmath132 films for the mef curves ; @xmath133 for @xmath129 film and @xmath134 for the @xmath131 and @xmath132 films for the exact sum curves . the value of @xmath135 quoted in the paper was used , and a value of @xmath136 was estimated from the experimental plots . there is a clear upturn in @xmath0 at low @xmath3 , but it is not explained by the mef curves which are effectively all upturn at these parameter values . again the fit to exact sum curves seems better .    in conclusion it seems that the experimental curves fit better to the exact sum curves than the mef curves . any low temperature upturns in @xmath0 are not explained by the mef formula , and presumably correspond to different physics . we thank i. aleiner , a. clerk , a.m. finkelstein , i.v . lerner and y. oreg for helpful discussions . ras acknowledges the support of a nuffield foundation award to newly appointed lecturers in science and mathematics . bsh acknowledges the support of a uk epsrc graduate studentship . va is supported by the us national science foundation under grant dmr-9805613 .","The text discusses the theory of superconductivity in low-dimensional systems, specifically thin films and narrow wires, and how it is affected by disorder.

"the mechanics and physics of soft materials are intrinsically complex due to the strongly time - dependent and usually non - linear constitutive stress - strain relations that govern their response . further intricacy is added when soft bodies are brought into contact and the problem is exacerbated by the geometry of the intimately mating surfaces . in the last two decades , the continuously growing technological relevance of engineering applications involving polymeric materials and soft tissues _ _  _ _ has generated enormous interest in the scientific community and has contributed to a leap in the number of publications in the field gorb , bio3,vertebrae ; these span investigations performed across the scales , from macroscopic to atomistic levels , and include analytical hunter , persson2001 numerical @xcite and experimental @xcite studies . surprisingly , in spite of these vast research efforts , our understanding of soft matter problems is definitely far from being complete .    in this paper , we focus our attention on an issue that has been systematically ignored but has a crucial importance : the reciprocating contact of viscoelastic materials , where the relative motion between the contacting bodies is periodically inverted . indeed , researchers have almost universally developed models to investigate unidirectional steady - state sliding between two mating surfaces made of viscoelastic material persson2001,carboneputignano . however , steady - state assumption can not be considered a universally valid condition . there is a countless variety of engineering applications , ranging from the macro- to the nano- scales , where a periodic inversion of the motion direction is present . earthquake viscoelastic dampers are a classic example @xcite . these devices are embedded in civil structures to limit the consequences of earthquakes by introducing a source of damping , that is , beyond the several possible configurations , the hysteretic dissipation occurring when a set of rigid punches deforms a layer of rubber . currently , the design in this field mostly relies on practical and empirical guidelines , and no tool for quantitative predictions is available . this lack of a robust theoretical framework involves also very different components , like all the sealing systems in mechanical applications with an alternate motion @xcite . indeed , enhancing performances and efficiency is infeasible without an accurate knowledge of the interfacial stresses and , consequently , of the dissipated power . finally , reciprocating contacts have prominence also at different scales and in different contexts , like biology and biotechnology ( @xcite,@xcite ) . skin , ocular system , joints , spine and vertebrae are some of the examples where viscoelastic soft contact occurs in the human body . as recently suggested in ref . @xcite , this can be observed up to the cell scale , thus introducing the concept of cell friction . indeed , ref . @xcite shows experimental results for reciprocating contact tests on layers of  epithelial cells : what is obtained in terms of friction can not be explained with a simple elastic model and needs a specific theory . the schematic in fig . [ figure0 ] captures the variety of surfaces whose function and/or performance can be ameliorated by shedding light on the principles governing the problem under investigation .        in this work , we develop a theoretical approach and a numerical technique that , for the first time , allow studying reciprocating contact mechanics between linearly viscoelastic solids and provide predictions of the response of the contacting surfaces in terms of stresses , strain and friction . the paper is outlined as follows . section ii describes the mathematical formulation which the numerical methodology relies on . section iii focuses on a simple , tough explicative , case , i.e. the reciprocating sliding contact of a sphere over a viscoelastic layer . final remarks are included to comment on the relevance of the theory and of the results . appendixes a and b respectively discuss the validity range of the model and provide a comparison with steady - state conditions . the proposed formulation builds on the strengths of the boundary element method ( bem ) in terms of accurately capturing interfacial stresses and displacements , and , as such , requires the determination of a viscoelastic reciprocating green s function @xmath0 .    to this end , let us first assume that the interfacial normal stress distribution obeys the law @xmath1 $ ] , i.e. that the shape of normal stress distribution is fixed but moves on the viscoelastic half - space with a sinusoidal law of amplitude @xmath2 and angular frequency @xmath3 . the vector @xmath4also identifies the direction of the reciprocating motion . because of linearity and translational invariance , replacing @xmath5 allows to write the relation between interfacial stresses and displacement as@xmath6 in order to determine @xmath0 , we recall that the general relation between stress and displacement fields is carboneputignano :    @xmath7    where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the elastic green s function and the creep material function respectively . the symbol ` @xmath10 ' stands for the time derivative . the creep function is easily linked to the viscoelastic modulus @xmath11 of the material by means of the relation @xmath12 @xcite , where @xmath13 is the imaginary unit and the fourier transform of a function @xmath14 is @xmath15 . the viscoelastic modulus has the general expression @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is a real quantity corresponding to the elastic modulus of the material at very large excitation frequencies . @xmath18 is usually defined as the creep spectrum , and @xmath19 is the relaxation time @xcite . in order to find @xmath20 we choose @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23 $ ] and , after substituting in eq .

( [ eq1 ] ) we need a numerical approach which consists in discretizing the contact domain in @xmath46 square cells . indeed , assuming that in each boundary element the normal stress @xmath47 is constant and equal to @xmath48 , the normal displacement @xmath49 at the centre @xmath50 of the @xmath13-th square can be written as :    @xmath51 \sum_{k=-\infty}^{+\infty}\frac{e^{ik\omega t}\left ( -i\right ) ^{k}}{e\left ( k\omega\right ) } \cos\left [ k\left ( \frac { 2r-1}{2n}\pi\right ) % \right ]   \label{eqfinale}\ ] ]    where @xmath52 is related to the love s solution johnson . it should be observed that eq . ( [ eqfinale ] ) is obtained by applying the chebishev - gauss quadrature rule to the integral term @xmath53 \left ( 1-s^{2}\right ) ^{-1/2}$ ] at @xmath46 nodes , thus making it easier to achieve the numerical convergence of the problem . ( [ visco_principle ] ) can be solved by using the iterative technique developed in ref . @xcite for elastic contacts , thus providing contact areas , stresses and strains . it should be noticed that the method does not require any discretization of the time domain as the time @xmath54 is treated as a parameter . once the solution is known in terms of stresses and strains , following the approach stated in ref . @xcite , it is straightforward to calculate the viscoelastic friction force as :    @xmath55    the friction coefficient is then obtained as @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the external applied load .    finally , we conclude noticing that the formulation , in the current form , does not explicitly account for the role of the tangential tractions at the contact interface . indeed , this is out of the scope of our work . the purpose of the paper is to determine the normal stresses and the normal displacements distribution , and , on this basis , calculate the viscoelastic friction that is proportional to the volume of deformed material . it is well known that the normal and tangential contact problems have only a very weak coupling , which is normally neglected @xcite . furthermore , in the case of a rigid body in contact with a soft layer which can be usually assumed incompressible- , it is absolutely rigorous to assert that tractions has no influence on normal pressure and displacements , and , consequently , on the viscoelastic dissipation @xcite . we study the contact of a rigid sphere of radius @xmath58 undergoing reciprocating sliding against a viscoelastic material characterized by one relaxation time ( being the ratio between the high frequency modulus and the low frequency @xmath59 and the poisson ratio @xmath60 ) . we assume that the center @xmath61 of the sphere moves on the viscoelastic half - space following the law @xmath62 $ ] . the dimensionless angular frequency of the reciprocating motion is @xmath63 @xmath64 , being @xmath19 the relaxation time of the viscoelastic material . figure [ figure1 ] shows the evolution of the dimensionless displacements ,  @xmath65 , at the centre of the contact as a function of @xmath66 and for a specific dimensionless applied normal load @xmath67 , and @xmath68 . results are shown for different values of @xmath69 $ ] . an arrow refers , in each case , to the current position of the sphere . at @xmath70 the sphere has just reached the left dead - point and starts moving from left to right . upon reversal of the sliding direction , and for @xmath71 , a marked increase of the dimensionless penetration at the center of the sphere is observed . this is due to the fact that , although the speed is increasing , it is still too low to cause a significant stiffening of the material , and the sphere is also moving over a portion of the viscoelastic half - space that has not yet had the time to relax after the previous contact of the rigid body . as the sliding speed increases , a non negligible stiffening of the material and a marked decrease of the penetration are observed ( see displacement in correspondence to the arrow ) . this is clearly shown by curves at @xmath72 , which also show additional deformation peaks , one at the left and one to the right of the arrow : this is the result of the interplay between the deformations , induced by the indenter as it moves to the right , and the original not yet fully relaxed footprints left by the sphere at preceding times . for @xmath73 , the sliding speed begins to decrease and the material softens again , thus leading to an increase of penetration . it is now possible to justify the occurrence of three different deformations peaks within the track when the sphere is moving between the two dead - ends : one corresponds to the current position of the sphere and the other two are located close to the left and right dead - points respectively , and are the result of the material inability to fully recover the viscoelastic deformations during a period of time comparable to the period @xmath74 @xmath75of the reciprocating motion ( recall that the relaxation time is @xmath76 ) . the merging or separation of the previous and current sphere footprints , which takes place close to the dead - points of the reciprocating motion , has a significant effect on the interfacial normal stress distribution . this is clearly shown in figure [ figure2 ] , which depicts the evolution of the pressure distribution and shows the shape of the contact area . let us first observe that at @xmath77 @xmath78 , _ i.e. _ when the sliding speed goes to zero , the contact area as well as the interfacial normal stress distribution are characterized by an asymmetric shape . the observed asymmetry and , in particular , the presence of a peak on the left of the contact patch is a consequence of the viscoelastic time - delay which prevents the material to relax immediately when the sliding speed vanishes . as the sphere starts moving to the right , such a peak can not disappear suddenly but has to show a gradual decrease . at the same time , since the punch is travelling towards the right , as already observed in steady - state viscoelastic contacts moving at constant velocity @xcite , a peak in the pressure distribution has to be originated also at the leading edge . finally , at the center of the distribution , where we have the maximum of the displacement field in the contact area , the pressure must still resemble the classical elastic hertzian solution . all this  process strongly affects the evolution of the pressure distribution at the interface with the presence of multiple pressure peaks shown by the snapshots taken at @xmath79 ( the reader may refer to appendix b to appreciate the difference with steady - state conditions ) . a single peaked pressure distribution is later recovered : indeed , an asymmetric pressure profile marked by a peak closer to the contact leading edge is visible at @xmath77 @xmath80 . we may observe that , for a single relaxation time material , in addition to the ratio @xmath81 , the behavior of the reciprocating contact is also governed by other two dimensionless parameters . the first dimensionless group is @xmath82 @xmath83 , where @xmath84 and @xmath85is the hertzian contact radius . this parameter can be also interpreted as a dimensionless sliding speed @xcite and compares the relaxation time @xmath19 with the time @xmath86 needed by the sphere to cover a distance @xmath44 . the second group , @xmath87 , compares , instead , the time @xmath86 with the period @xmath88 of the reciprocating motion . since we have earlier assumed that in our problem @xmath89 , we can focus on observing how the solution is affected by @xmath90 . for extremely small or extremely high values of @xmath91 the response of the system is elastic ( governed by either the high or the low frequency elastic limit of the material ) , and no tangential contact force will be generated . at intermediate values of @xmath92 , viscoelasticity will affect the solution leading to asymmetric contact areas and pressure distributions , and to the generation of tangential contact forces . in such a case , given the dimensionless parameter @xmath93 , if @xmath94 , the reciprocating motion will occur on time - scales longer than the relaxation time @xmath19 of the material and the system will resemble the steady - state behavior of the contact between a sphere moving on a viscoelastic half - space at constant speed @xcite . if @xmath95 , as in the case of fig . [ figure2 ] , a strong interaction will be observed between different viscoelastic regions of the path covered by the sphere during the reciprocating motion . note that , under the assumption small @xmath96 values ( which has been always adopted in this paper ) , the condition @xmath97 implies @xmath98 , and , in this case , the elastic response of the material will be recovered : the sphere will be just performing very fast oscillations , leading to a local stiffening and , ultimately , to a high frequency elastic behavior .    in figure [ figure3 ] , the reduced tangential force , @xmath99 , easily calculated once pressures and displacements are known @xcite , is plotted as a function of the dimensionless abscissa @xmath66 , which identifies the position of the sphere along the path , for different values of @xmath100 . for @xmath101 the material has the possibility to relax before a single reciprocating cycle is completed . in this case , as the solution resembles the steady - state viscoelastic sliding contact , the tangential force @xmath99 always opposes the sphere speed at each point along the path . however , as @xmath100 is increased ( see _ e.g. _ results for @xmath102 presented in figure [ figure3 ] ) the relaxation of the material involves time scales comparable to the time period of the reciprocating motion ; in this case , there exist regions on the sphere track , specifically those close to the dead - points , where @xmath99 has the same direction as the sliding speed . this is perfectly consistent with the results presented in figure [ figure2 ] . this work provides the explicit solution , in terms of a fourier series , of the green s function of the reciprocating contact problem between a rigid punch and a linear viscoelastic solid . the periodic features , intrinsically marking the problem , enables the parametric calculation of the contact solution for each time step without any necessity of employing the solution in the previous time interval . by implementing such a parametrically time - dependent approach , we obtain the full numerical convergence in each moment of the cycle and , interestingly , also when the punch inverts its motion . for the simple case of a sphere in contact with a viscoelastic layer , we show that the behavior of the system is completely determined by two parameters , that are @xmath82 @xmath83 and @xmath103 _ . _ depending on these two parameters , the viscoelastic reciprocating contact may present a wide variety of different behaviors , ranging from the case that can be captured by the steady - state solution for viscoelastic sliding to the case where such interactions lead to the formation of a multi - peaked interfacial pressure distribution and tangential contact forces in ( rather than opposing ) the direction of the sliding speed . this may have important implications in terms of design of materials and solutions for different applications as it would enable to accurately capture deformation rates , stress distributions and viscoelastic friction during reciprocation . indeed , these are the key quantities to understand cell growth and skin / counterface interactions , as well as to predict frictional energy dissipation in _ e.g. _ mechanical seals and earthquake dampers . when dealing with materials marked by a linear response , the displacement distribution can be related to the interfacial pressures by means of a convolution integral with a time- and space - dependent function , i.e. the green s function . we may , then , formulate the general contact problem between a rigid indenter and a linearly viscoelastic slab as :    @xmath104    where @xmath105 is the in - plane position vector , @xmath54 is the time , @xmath106 is the normal surface displacement of the viscoelastic slab , @xmath21 is the normal interfacial stress , @xmath8 and @xmath107 are respectively the elastic green s function and the creep material function . the relevance of such an approach is related to its generality : no assumption is made _ a priori _ on the shape of the contact domain . indeed , the method can be employed for any kind of contact punch and even for rough surfaces : conditions , like periodic boundaries and finite values of contacting layers thickness , can be easily managed carbone2008,putignanoijss2 . furthermore , since the creep function @xmath108 is absolutely general , the approach is capable of dealing with any linearly viscoelastic material , from skin tissues to rubber - based composites . however , solving directly eq . ( [ general formulaion ] ) may be extremely challenging : due to the necessity of performing discretization both in time and space , the computational cost is huge and often infeasible with the computational technologies currently available . consequently , when focusing our attention on the reciprocating contacts , our efforts are aimed at reducing the computational complexity of eq . ( [ general formulaion ] ) without loosing its generality in terms of contact geometry and material properties . indeed , by assuming that the shape of the interfacial normal stress distribution does not change , i.e. assuming that it obeys the law @xmath109 $ ] - where @xmath110 and @xmath3 are respectively the amplitude and angular frequency of the sinusoidal law- , eq . ( [ general formulaion ] ) can be re - written in the form stated in eq . ( [ eq1 ] ) . this expression has a significant advantage : it does not require any discretization of the time domain since @xmath54 is present just as a parameter of the viscoelastic reciprocating green s function @xmath0 . such a formulation enables us to employ the efficient computational techniques already developed for the purely elastic case @xcite and , therefore , to find the solution for a reciprocating contact . incidentally , we observe that , from a physical point of view , passing from eq . ( [ general formulaion ] ) to eq . ( [ eq1 ] ) is fully justified recalling the periodic features of the system under investigation .    in this paper , we determine @xmath0 and investigate the main peculiarities of the reciprocating contact mechanics . indeed , when developing the mathematical formulation , we rely on the aforementioned condition of a constant shape of the interfacial stress distribution . recalling that the total time derivative of pressure field is @xmath111 , the condition implies that , the local rate of change in the pressure @xmath112 , which occurs on time - scales of the order of the period @xmath113 of the reciprocating motion , should be negligible compared to the rate of change of pressure due to the convective term @xmath114 , which occurs on time - scale of @xmath86 , where @xmath86 is the time needed by the sphere to cover a distance of the order of the contact radius @xmath44 . this then requires that @xmath115 . this can be easily shown by estimating the local time derivative and the convective term and requiring that @xmath116 , i.e.@xmath117where @xmath118 is the maximum contact pressure and , then , by taking the ratio of the derivative terms , one obtains :    @xmath119    at the end of each stroke during reciprocation , the aforementioned condition may look critical since the velocity of the sphere tends to vanish ; however , since the time the sphere spends at the dead points of the cyclic sliding motion is also zero , things have to be observed a bit more carefully . indeed , we can calculate the time @xmath86 to cover a distance of the order @xmath120 when the sphere starts moving from the dead point : the distance @xmath121 can be estimated as @xmath122 . one can , then , easily show that @xmath123 ; hence , if @xmath124 , also @xmath125 will be sufficiently small to justify the constant shape assumption also at the dead points . incidentally , we observe that we have numerically checked the condition @xmath126 for all the cases presented in the main manuscript once the stress distribution was calculated from the solution of eq . ( [ eq1 ] ) . one of the main purposes of this paper is to shed light on the unique features of the viscoelastic reciprocating contacts . to this aim , it can be useful here to point out the differences between viscoelastic steady - state sliding and reciprocating conditions . from a physical point of view , the two conditions are almost antithetical : in the steady - state case , the punch always meets underformed material @xcite ; on the contrary , as we explain in the main manuscript , when dealing with reciprocating contacts , the rigid punch may deform a region of material that has not yet relaxed . only in the limit case of very small values of the parameter @xmath100 , i.e. given a relaxation time @xmath19 for very small frequencies @xmath3 , the reciprocating case tends to a steady - state - like regime , where the material has got time to relax before the punch re - engages with it . this physical background entails remarkable differences in terms of interfacial pressures , normal displacements and , consequently , friction . in fig . [ figab ] , we compare the contour plots of the normal pressure for the two cases , i.e. the reciprocating contact conditions and the sliding steady - state contacts . in fig . ( [ figab]a ) , at the inversion point , i.e. when the speed is nominally equal to zero , in the reciprocating case , the pressure still shows a marked asymmetry , that is the consequence of the viscoelastic time - delay which prevents the material to relax immediately when the sliding speed vanishes . on the contrary , in steady - state conditions , the solution at zero speed can not be anything else that the elastic classic hertzian solution with the zero - frequency modulus @xmath127 . furthermore , given a constant normal load , in this last case , due to the lower modulus , the contact area is much bigger and normal stresses are much smaller . when the punch starts moving back to the right dead point , we still have remarkable differences in the pressure distributions ( see fig . ( [ figab]b ) . such differences are also clearly perceived when looking at the normal displacements . upon the motion inversion , we observe the formation of an additional peak in the displacement distribution : this is impossible in steady - state conditions . different distributions in terms of pressure and normal displacements lead to a different hysteretic curve ( see figure figure3 in the main manuscript ) , thus highlighting the importance of the unique features that characterize reciprocating contact conditions . johannessen w. , vresilovic e. j. , wright a. c. , elliott d. m. , intervertebral disc mechanics are restored following cyclic loading and unloaded recovery . annals of biomedical engineering , 32 , 1 , 70 - 76 , ( 2004 ) . carbone g. , putignano c. , a novel methodology to predict sliding / rolling friction in viscoelastic materials : theory and experiments . , journal of mechanics and physics of solids , journal of the mechanics and physics of solids , 61 ( 8) , 1822 - 1834 , ( 2013 ) . dunn a. c. , cobb j. a. , kantzios a. n. , lee s. j. , sarntinoranont m. , tran - son - tay r. , sawyer w. g. , friction coefficient measurement of hydrogel materials on living epithelial cells , tribology letters , 30 , 1,13 - 19 , ( 2008 ) . putignano c. , afferrante l. , carbone g. , demelio g. , the influence of the statistical properties of self - affine surfaces in elastic contact : a numerical investigation , journal of mechanics and physics of solids , 60 , 5 , 973982 , ( 2012 ) .","The paper discusses the mechanics of soft materials and their reciprocating contact with viscoelastic solids. The authors focus on the reciprocating contact problem, where the contacting bodies are in motion relative to each other. The problem is complex due to the time-dependent and non-linear constitutive stress-strain relations of the materials involved.

The authors propose a theoretical approach to study the reciprocating contact mechanics between a rigid punch and a linear viscoelastic solid. They use a fourier series expansion to","a theory of reciprocating contacts for linear viscoelastic materials is presented . 
 results are discussed for the case of a rigid sphere sinusoidally driven in sliding contact with a viscoelastic half - space . 
 depending on the size of the contact , the frequency and amplitude of the reciprocating motion , and on the relaxation time of the viscoelastic body , we establish that the contact behavior may range from the steady - state viscoelastic solution , in which traction forces always oppose the direction of the sliding rigid punch , to a more elaborate trend , never observed before , which is due to the strong interaction between different regions of the path covered during the reciprocating motion .

"granular materials such as sand and powders have generated much interest of late . such an ensemble of particles with macroscopic size is challenging since it may behave as a solid , a liquid or a gas . size separation , pattern formation , avalanches , compaction and convection are just a few examples of the wide array of observed phenomena@xcite . flow underlies most of these phenomena and therefore , theoretical studies so far focus on formulating a hydrodynamical description appropriate to sand@xcite . these theories , stemming from the boltzmann equation , depend on the assumption of `` molecular chaos '' , _ i.e. _ , the assumption that no interparticle correlations exist . this assumption is far from obvious . as a dissipative dynamical system , a granular system has attractors in its phase space , which may cause correlations between particles . under certain conditions , these attractors lead to a singularity , inelastic collapse , which can not be explained by hydrodynamics . in one dimension , these attractors are so strong that hydrodynamics breaks down for the entire parameter space@xcite  in a confined geometry , all particles , save one , form a practically stationary clump against the elastic wall , while the remaining particle moves rapidly back and forth between the clump and the heated wall . such a state clearly violates partition of energy .    in this study , we investigate the corresponding situation in two - dimensions@xcite . we consider inelastic hard spheres in a box where one wall is kept at a fixed temperature and the other three are reflecting ( see fig . [ fig : syspict ] ) . energy input at the heated wall balances the dissipation due to inter - particle collisions and the system can achieve a steady state . unlike the one - dimensional situation , the density and the temperature profiles are smooth functions of the distance from the heated wall . in the steady - state , the momentum balance equations imply that the pressure is constant throughout the system . particles move faster close to the energy source and more slowly deeper inside the system due to energy loss . thus the density is greater farther away from the wall to maintain a constant pressure . density variations may be a consequence of the above mechanism or an effect of the intrinsic attractors in the system which build up correlations among particles . assuming that the particles are not coherent in the quasi - elastic limit , we derive a differential equation that describes the density variation throughout the system . heuristic expressions for the mean - free path , the equation of state , and the thermal conductivity are incorporated into the energy flux balance equation to obtain a closed equation describing the steady - state density profiles . the theory compares well with simulational results over a wide range of densities in the quasi - elastic limit . =    our theory is appropriate for a steady - state which is very close to an equilibrium state . we expect this to be applicable only in the nearly elastic limit . we argue that in the complementary situation of stronger inelasticity , hydrodynamics may still be relevant . to analyze the nature of the steady - state , we study velocity distributions throughout the system . we observe that the velocity distributions exhibit scaling . this observation is then used to obtain a qualitative description of the behavior of the system . granular materials are different from ordinary fluids or gases in that the diameter of a particle may be comparable to the collisional mean free path . to formulate a hydrodynamic theory , it is necessary to describe how the mean free path , the pressure , and the thermal diffusivity depend on the grain diameter , the number density , and the temperature . in this section , we obtain heuristic expressions for these quantities . let us denote the number density of grains by @xmath0 , the mean free path by @xmath1 , and the grain diameter by @xmath2 . without loss of generality , we set the particle mass and the boltzmann constant to unity : @xmath3 . the granular temperature can be defined as the average kinetic energy per particle : @xmath4 . this quantity is well defined for an equilibrium state in which the particles have a symmetric velocity distribution . in such a case , @xmath5 , can be used as an approximate value for the average grain speed . in our system , quantities such as temperature , density , etc . , are position dependent , and there is not a global equilibrium . however , in the quasi - elastic limit , we expect the system to be very close to local thermal equilibrium . let @xmath6 be the distance from the heated wall . in the steady state , all quantities vary only in this transverse direction . the energy balance equation can therefore be written @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the energy flux in the @xmath6 direction . the sink term @xmath9 accounts for the energy lost per unit area per unit time due to inelastic collisions . the energy flux is induced by a temperature gradient , @xmath10 , where the coefficient of thermal diffusivity , @xmath11 , is positive . consequently , we find @xmath12      since collisions between grains are inelastic , kinetic energy is continually transferred into heat . for simplicity we neglect rotation and thus , the degree of inelasticity can be parameterized by @xmath13 . when two particles collide , their tangential velocities are unchanged , while the relative normal velocity is decreased by a factor of @xmath14 , where the negative sign merely indicates that they move apart after a collision . using momentum conservation one can write the final velocities ( indicated by primes ) in terms of the initial velocities @xmath15 in the above equation , the subscript @xmath16 denotes the velocity component along the line connecting the centers of particles 1 and 2 . the energy lost in each collision is therefore @xmath17 in this study , we focus on the quasi - elastic limit , i.e.  @xmath18 . physically , this limit is relevant to hard particles such as glass or steel beads .    using the above expression for the energy dissipated in each collision , one can estimate the sink term , @xmath9 , the mean energy lost per unit area per unit time . consider a particle moving with speed @xmath19 . during each collision , it loses , on average , energy proportional to @xmath20 . in unit time , it collides roughly @xmath21 times . in unit area , there are @xmath0 particles , and consequently @xmath22      suppose there is a temperature gradient in the @xmath6-direction . as a result , there will be an energy flux along this axis . to calculate this flux , let us consider the number of particles crossing a line perpendicular to this direction in a time interval @xmath23 . we define `` crossing the line '' as having any part of the particle over the line during this time interval . to cross the line within @xmath23 , a particle with speed @xmath19 must have its rightmost point @xmath24 or closer to the line . thus , only grains in an area ( @xmath25 ) to the left of the line can pass the line from the left in @xmath23 . in fact , only one half of these particles are moving to the right , so the number of particles crossing the line per unit cross - sectional length in @xmath23 is @xmath26 . in a steady state , the number of crossing events from each side must balance . any energy flux is due to the fact that particles coming from the right are at a different temperature ( @xmath27 ) than those from the left ( @xmath28 ) and thus , @xmath29 . consider two grains on opposite sides of the line . their centers are approximately a distance @xmath30 apart , so the temperature difference is roughly @xmath31 . the coefficient of thermal conductivity is therefore @xmath32 . a natural choice for @xmath23 is the typical collision time @xmath33 . this choice is small enough to avoid multicounting and is sufficiently large to ensure that heat transfer does occur . our heuristic picture therefore estimates the thermal diffusivity by @xmath34 this is a rough approximation ; the actual prefactors depend on the velocity distribution of the grains . therefore , we generally assume @xmath35    the energy balance equation  ( [ eq : m2 ] ) takes the form @xmath36 = ( 1-r^2)\frac{\rho t^\frac{3}{2}}{\gamma l } \label{eq : m3}\ ] ] where @xmath37 is the ratio of prefactors in the expressions for @xmath9 and @xmath11 . in the following subsections , we discuss how to obtain the dimensionless coefficients @xmath38 and @xmath37 self - consistently . to proceed , it is necessary to relate @xmath0 and @xmath39 through the equation of state . additionally , the mean free path @xmath1 must be expressed in terms of @xmath0 . for the system to be in a steady state , the pressure must be constant throughout . the equation of state relates the pressure and the temperature to the density . for example , in the low density limit , the ideal gas law holds , @xmath40 . using @xmath41 and @xmath42 , one has @xmath43 on the other hand , in the high density limit , the mean free path , which is simply the interparticle spacing , is much less than the particle diameter ( @xmath44 ) . denoting the close - packing density by @xmath45 , one finds @xmath46 in this limit , the center of a grain is confined to an area of the order of @xmath47 , so the entropy per particle , @xmath48 , equals @xmath49 plus a function of temperature . from eq . ( [ eqn : denl ] ) , @xmath48 depends on density only through the term @xmath50 . using maxwell s relation , @xmath51 we obtain the pressure in the limit @xmath52 , @xmath53 we therefore propose the following interpolation formula for the pressure @xmath54 indeed , in the limits of high and low density this expression reduces to ( [ eqn : pressld ] ) and ( [ eqn : presshd ] ) , respectively . it is useful to compare this expression with the van der waal s equation of state which takes into account long range attraction and hard core repulsion @xcite . for an inelastic gas of hard spheres , there are no long range forces , and the van der waal s pressure for a two - dimensional gas reads @xmath55 for @xmath56 . in the low density limit the pressure given by eq . ( [ eqn : pressgen ] ) agrees with the van der waal s expression to second order in @xmath57 . furthermore , one can also compare ( [ eqn : pressgen ] ) to tonks series expansion  @xcite for the pressure of a two - dimensional gas of hard spheres , @xmath58/ [ 1 - 1.307(\rho/\rho_c)^3 + 0.307(\rho/\rho_c)^4]$ ] , valid for all densities . over the entire density range , the two expressions differ by less than 1.3% . in contrast , we found that the van der waal s formula is inadequate for describing the high density limit . hence , we use the interpolation formula ( [ eqn : pressgen ] ) for the pressure . the mean free path can be expressed in terms of the density and the diameter . in the low density limit one has @xmath59 while in the high density limit , eq .  ( [ eqn : denl ] ) gives @xmath60 again , we use these high and low density limits to interpolate a general expression for the mean free path . using the 2d close - packing value @xmath61 , we find @xmath62 where @xmath63 . ( [ eqn : pressgen ] ) and  ( [ eqn : lgen ] ) express the temperature and the mean free path in terms of the density . substituting these expressions into eq . ( [ eq : m3 ] ) yields a second order differential equation for @xmath0 . using for convenience the variable @xmath64 , we have @xmath65 =   \nonumber\\ & & \hspace{-6cm}\frac{32}{3d^2 } \frac{1-r^2}{\gamma } \frac{z - a}{(z+1)^{3/2 } } \sqrt{\frac{z-1}{z}}. \label{eqn : zgen}\end{aligned}\ ] ] this equation is complemented by the boundary conditions @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the width of the system and @xmath68 is the total number of particles . the latter condition merely reflects conservation of particles . the former condition is a consequence of the fact that the temperature gradient vanishes at the elastic wall .    in principle , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are two dimensionless factors which can be calculated exactly from the velocity distribution . however , this distribution is poorly understood . nevertheless , it is still possible to estimate these prefactors by comparing the theoretical predictions of eq . ( [ eqn : bcnorm ] ) with numerical simulations in the limit of high and low densities .    in both of these extreme cases the governing equation  ( [ eqn : zgen ] ) can be solved analytically . in the high density limit , @xmath69 , or equivalently , @xmath70 , eq . ( [ eqn : zgen ] ) reduces to @xmath71 . it is convenient to write this equation in terms of the temperature , @xmath72 . from  ( [ eqn : pressgen ] ) , @xmath73 when @xmath70 , and the temperature obeys @xmath74 with @xmath75 . solving this equation subject to the boundary condition @xmath76 at @xmath77 gives the temperature profile @xmath78 far from the elastic wall , @xmath79 , the temperature decays exponentially in agreement with haff s calculation @xcite @xmath80 eq .  ( [ eqn : lgen ] ) shows that in the high density limit , @xmath81 . both the temperature and the mean free path decay exponentially with the distance from the heated wall . the decay length @xmath82 is much larger than the mean free path . for the continuum description to be valid , @xmath82 must also be much larger than the diameter of a particle , @xmath2 , i.e. , @xmath83 since the prefactor @xmath37 is of order unity , we learn that the continuum theory is valid only in the quasi - elastic limit , @xmath84 . ( note that the restriction @xmath84 is stricter than @xmath18 . )    to test the theoretical predictions , we performed an event - driven simulation of the system@xcite . the heated wall is implemented in such a way that for @xmath85 , particles have a boltzmann velocity distribution with an average temperature equal to one . specifically , any particle that collides with the wall at @xmath86 is ejected with a positive @xmath87 drawn from the probability distribution @xmath88 and a @xmath89 drawn from @xmath90@xcite . however , the behavior of particles in the bulk of the system is independent of the details of the boundary condition ( see fig .  [ fig : vxscal ] below ) . this is not surprising , but rather a necessity for a thermodynamic theory to be valid . numerical simulations confirm the exponential decay in the quasi - elastic limit . furthermore , the decay length @xmath82 can be measured for various degrees of inelasticity @xmath91 ( see fig .  [ fig : denscal ] ) . we verified that indeed @xmath92 as suggested by eq . ( [ eqn : hdtemp ] ) . the value of the prefactor @xmath93 can be found from the simulations as well . =    we now turn to the low density limit . here , @xmath94 , and eq . ( [ eqn : zgen ] ) reduces to @xmath95 . as a result , @xmath96 where @xmath97 , and we have used the boundary condition of eq . ( [ eqn : bcnorm ] ) and the notation @xmath98 . simulations show that the density near the heated wall is significantly smaller than the density at the elastic wall . thus , for @xmath99 and @xmath100 , we find the following approximate solution @xmath101 the inverse of the density , and hence the temperature , decays linearly with @xmath6 in the low density regime near the heated wall . that the low density decay length @xmath102 is similar to the high density decay length @xmath103 , reflects the fact that the underlying differential equation is second order .    in the nearly elastic case ( @xmath18 ) , @xmath104 is close to @xmath105 , and eq . ( [ eqn : lddzdx ] ) can be integrated exactly @xmath106_{z_0}^{z(x)}.\ ] ] comparing this prediction with low density numerical simulations allows us to determine @xmath107 at various @xmath91 values ( see fig . [ fig : dilscal ] ) and verify that indeed @xmath108 . the constant of proportionality and the previously calculated @xmath37 yields @xmath109 . =    in the low density limit , the equation of state @xmath110 , implies that @xmath111 . for the state to be locally very close to equilibrium , the mean free path must be much less than the length scale over which the temperature is changing , i.e. , @xmath112 . this condition is @xmath113 when the temperature is of order unity . since @xmath38 and @xmath37 are also of order unity , the hydrodynamic description is again valid only in the quasi - elastic regime ( @xmath84 ) . our treatment so far has concentrated on either the high or the low density limit , where analytical expressions were possible . for systems that include both high and low density regions , eq . ( [ eqn : zgen ] ) can be solved numerically using the boundary and normalization conditions  ( [ eqn : bcnorm ] ) and the previously calculated values for @xmath37 and @xmath38 . by examining a number of simulations that include a range of densities we determined that the optimal values for the prefactors are @xmath114 and @xmath115 . while this value of @xmath37 is consistent with the value obtained in the high density calculation , this @xmath38 value is slightly lower than our prediction . a typical system with @xmath116 is shown in fig .  [ fig : samp ] , and it is seen that the predictions of hydrodynamic theory match the numerical data over wide density variations . for this simulation , the ratio @xmath117 is approximately @xmath118 , which is not of order unity , so the condition of eq . ( [ eq : valid2 ] ) is satisfied . the calculation in the previous section assumes that the steady state is very close to equilibrium , and that pressure and temperature can be used to describe the system . this requires that condition ( [ eq : valid1 ] ) is satisfied in the high density limit , or condition ( [ eq : valid2 ] ) is satisfied in the low density limit .    an important question is : when does the behavior of the system changes qualitatively ? one such transition occurs when @xmath91 becomes low enough for the system to undergo inelastic collapse . here strong correlations and large density variations develop , and applying hydrodynamics becomes impossible . even when @xmath91 is slightly higher than the critical value for inelastic collapse , the attractors mentioned in the introduction may still be strong enough to build correlations . where this breakdown occurs is determined by the degree of inelasticity , the density and the total number of particles@xcite . for each pair of values of density and total number of particles , there is a value of @xmath91 which divides two different kinds of behavior : loose sand and coherent sand . however , the theory developed in the previous section is strictly for the quasi - elastic limit , @xmath18 , so there may exist systems that , although elastic enough to avoid inelastic collapse , still have @xmath91 far enough from one that the hydrodynamics do not apply . since correlations between particles are built up through inelastic collisions , high density regions are more liable to inelastic collapse@xcite , while for low density regions , correlations are harder to establish . therefore , we will investigate the low density limit in order to observe the breakdown of the hydrodynamic description as the degree of inelasticity increases . when the temperature variation within a mean free path is significant , the system is unable to reach local equilibrium . therefore , particles carrying energy away from the heated wall can not share this energy with the slow particles returning from the higher density region near the elastic wall . this inefficient mixing leads to a temperature gap  the average energy of particles with @xmath119 is greater than that of the particles with @xmath120 ( see fig .  [ fig : tempdiff ] ) . furthermore , near the heated wall , the temperature drops by approximately @xmath121 over a mean free path , which suggests that such a system will be unable to reach local thermal equilibrium ( see fig . [ fig : mfp ] ) . =    =    the probability distribution functions for @xmath87 ( the velocity perpendicular to the heated wall ) provide an illuminating way to measure this deviation from equilibrium ( see fig .  [ fig : vxskew ] ) . note the asymmetry : the @xmath122 tail is longer than the @xmath120 tail . this is consistent with our understanding that the @xmath122 particles have more energy than the @xmath120 ones . a rough quantification of the deviation from equilibrium is provided by condition  ( [ eq : valid2 ] ) : when @xmath117 is of order unity , the theory breaks down . for @xmath123 ( the value used in the figures ) , this quantity is approximately @xmath124 . note that this condition involves @xmath91 only and is not sensitive to the local density @xmath0 . this suggests that the behavior of regions of the system with different densities should be similar . in fact , we observed that the velocity distribution function obeys scaling ( see fig . [ fig : vxscal ] ) , i.e. , @xmath125 the function @xmath126 is independent of boundary conditions ( see fig .  [ fig : vxscal ] ) . thus @xmath127 , where the constant of proportionality depends only on the shape of the function @xmath126 . note that this shape will depend on @xmath91 , the degree of inelasticity ; the more inelastic the particles are , the more skewed the velocity distribution is . the probability distribution for the @xmath128-component of the velocity behaves similarly : @xmath129 but here @xmath130 is a symmetric , nearly gaussian , function . additionally , the same velocity scale @xmath131 characterizes the transverse and the longitudinal velocity distributions . therefore , while at each position @xmath6 there is no longer a single hydrodynamic temperature , there is a well defined characteristic velocity scale , @xmath131 , so that the granular temperature , @xmath132 , is proportional to @xmath133 . this scaling suggests that , although the system may deviate significantly from equilibrium , it can still be treated using some of the tools of the previous sections . specifically , return to the equation for energy balance  ( [ eqn : enerbal ] ) : @xmath134 , where @xmath9 is the energy loss due to collisions per unit time per unit area , and @xmath8 is the energy flux , the heat transfer per unit cross - sectional length per unit time . as discussed previously , @xmath135 while the heat flux is approximately @xmath136 conservation of momentum flux suggests that @xmath137 is constant , and the energy balance equation gives @xmath138 which indicates that @xmath139 , and hence the temperature , depends linearly on @xmath6 . this prediction is consistent with our simulational results ( fig . [ fig : gandg2 ] ) . in this work , we examined the steady - state behavior of a weakly inelastic two - dimensional driven granular system . we found that a hydrodynamic formulation provides a satisfactory description of the near - equilibrium behavior of the system in the quasi - elastic limit . we extended haff s theory to the low density limit and found that the corresponding temperature profile varies linearly in space . for slightly higher inelasticities , the system is no longer close to equilibrium in the low density limit . however , the scaling behavior of the velocity distributions suggests that a hydrodynamic treatment can still be useful in describing the system .    in this non - equilibrium regime , we found that the particle velocity distributions were non - gaussian . indeed , deviations from normal distributions have been observed in theoretical @xcite and experimental studies@xcite . in addition to this variation in the velocity distributions , systems of this sort can produce highly inhomogeneous spatial distributions , as has been noted elsewhere in one @xcite and two @xcite dimensions . a recent experimental study examined the spatial distribution of hard particles in two dimensions in the presence of an energy input @xcite . their data is in qualitative agreement with our theoretical predictions , and inhomogeneous spatial distributions reminiscent of fig . ( 1 ) are observed . * acknowledgements : * we are indebted to leo kadanoff for stimulating our interest in this problem . we also thank bill young , tom witten , sergei esipov and thorsten pschel for useful discussions . this work was supported by the national science foundation under awards # dmr-9415604 and # dmr-9208527 and the mrsec program , award # dmr-9400379 . 99 h.  m.  jaeger , s.  r.  nagel , and r.  p.  behringer , phys .  today * 49 * , 32 ( 1996 ) . k.  haff , j.  fluid mech .  * 134 * , 401 ( 1983 ) . j.  t.  jenkins and m.  w.  richman , j.  fluid mech .  * 192 * , 313 ( 1988 ) . y.  du , h.  li , and l.  p.  kadanoff , phys . lett .  * 74 * , 1268 ( 1995 ) . e.  l.  grossman and b.  roman , phys . fluids * 8 * , 3218 ( 1996 ) . j.  maddox , nature * 374 * , 11 ( 1995 ) . s.  e.  esipov and t.  pschel , `` boltzmann equation and granular hydrodynamics , '' preprint . h.  hayakawa , s.  yue , and d.  c.  hong , phys . lett .  * 75 * , 2328 ( 1995 ) . l.  tonks , phys . 50 * , 955 ( 1936 ) . i.  goldhirsch and g.  zanetti , phys . , 1619 ( 1993 ) . s.  mcnamara and w.  r.  young , phys . e * 53 * , 5089 ( 1996 ) . y.  d.  lan and a.  d.  rosato , phys . fluids * 7 * , 1818 ( 1995 ) . y.  h.  taguchi and h.  takayasu , europhys . lett .   * 30 * , 499 ( 1995 ) . s.  warr , g.  t.  h.  jaques , and j.  m.  huntley , powder tech . * 81 * , 41 ( 1994 ) . s.  mcnamara and j .- l . barrat , `` the energy flux into a fluidized granular medium at a vibrating wall , '' preprint . a.  kudrolli , m.  wolpert , and j.  p.  gollub , `` cluster formation due to collisions in granular material , '' preprint .","The text discusses the behavior of granular materials, specifically in the context of a two-dimensional system with a heated wall. The authors investigate the behavior of particles in the system under different conditions, including high and low density limits, and compare the theoretical predictions with numerical simulations.

**Main Points:**

1. The authors propose a hydrodynamic theory for granular materials, which assumes that the particles have a non-elastic collision mechanism.
2. The theory is based on the Boltzmann equation, which","we study steady - state properties of inelastic gases in two - dimensions in the presence of an energy source . 
 we generalize previous hydrodynamic treatments to situations where high and low density regions coexist . 
 the theoretical predictions compare well with numerical simulations in the nearly elastic limit . 
 it is also seen that the system can achieve a nonequilibrium steady - state with asymmetric velocity distributions , and we discuss the conditions under which such situations occur .

"recently several authors @xcite have used exact functional renormalization group ( rg ) methods to gain a deeper understanding of strongly correlated non - relativistic fermions in reduced dimensions . the exact functional rg yields an infinite hierarchy of coupled differential equations describing the change of the correlation functions due to the elimination and the rescaling of the degrees of freedom . for classical statistical mechanics problems the exact functional rg has been developed long time ago in a pioneering work by wegner and houghton @xcite , who performed the usual three rg - steps @xcite to derive their exact flow equation :    1 . integrate out fields with momenta @xmath1 in a shell @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is infinitesimal and @xmath4 is some ultraviolet cutoff . 2 .   rescale the remaining momenta by a factor @xmath5 and express all quantities in terms of the rescaled momenta . 3 .   rescale the remaining fields by a factor of @xmath6 , where the anomalous dimension @xmath7 has to be chosen such that the rg has a fixed point @xcite .    over the years several alternative formulations of the exact functional rg in field theory and statistical physics have been proposed @xcite . note , however , that recent applications of the exact rg for two - dimensional fermions @xcite take only the mode elimination step 1 into account , and do not perform the above rescaling steps 2 and 3 . while such a procedure is legitimate if one is interested in solving a given many - body problem iteratively , the wilsonian rg amounts to more than that @xcite : by combining the mode elimination with a suitable rescaling of the degrees of freedom , the wilsonian rg generates a mapping of the original many - body problem onto a continuous family of new many - body problems , labeled by a flow parameter @xmath8 . in the limit @xmath9 it sometimes happens that the resulting problem simplifies and can be solved in a controlled manner . in order to obtain a non - trivial rg fixed point for @xmath9 which is characterized by a non - zero anomalous dimension @xmath7 , it is crucial that the fields are properly rescaled , as discussed in detail by bell and wilson @xcite . for example , by applying the exact functional rg to @xmath10-theory @xcite , it is easy to see that without the rescaling the rg flow does not reproduce the wilson - fisher fixed point below four dimensions , see sec.[subsec : wilson ] . we therefore believe that the rg calculations of refs.@xcite are incomplete , and should be augmented by the usual rescaling steps 2 and 3 given above . note that the rescaling is explicitly included in the one loop momentum - shell approach advanced by shankar@xcite , so that one may wonder why the exact functional rg used in refs.@xcite does not include the rescaling . we shall try to clarify this point in this work by showing how to include the rescaling of the degrees of freedom in the exact functional rg for fermionic many - body systems in arbitrary dimensions . we then point out several advantages of working with the rescaled version of the exact rg flow equations . in this section we present a brief derivation of the exact flow equation describing the change in the legendre effective action @xmath11 due to the elimination of the degrees of freedom with momenta and frequencies in a suitably defined shell . keeping in mind that the legendre effective action is the generating functional of the one - particle irreducible correlation functions @xcite , an expansion of @xmath11 in powers of the fields @xmath12 and @xmath13 yields the corresponding flow equations for the irreducible @xmath0-point vertices . for classical field theories , the flow equation for the legendre effective action has been considered some time ago by nicoll et al.@xcite , and more recently by wetterich @xcite , and by morris @xcite . for non - relativistic fermions the exact flow equation for the legendre effective action has recently been derived in a very general form by honerkamp , salmhofer and co - authors@xcite , who also included the possibility of symmetry breaking . our derivation given below is less general but more explicit ; in particular , we shall adopt as much as possible the standard notations from the theory of critical phenomena @xcite . we consider a translationally invariant non - relativistic system of interacting fermions with a fermi surface . throughout this work we assume that the fermions are in the normal state , so that the propagator does not have any anomalous components . by _ fermi surface _ we mean the true fermi surface of the interacting system , which is defined as the set of all momenta satisfying@xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the energy dispersion of the non - interacting system , @xmath16 is the exact chemical potential and @xmath17 is the exact self - energy of the interacting many - body system . here @xmath1 is the momentum and @xmath18 is the matsubara frequency . given an arbitrary @xmath1 , we may define a corresponding momentum @xmath19 on the fermi surface via the decomposition @xcite @xmath20 as shown in fig.[fig : fs ] . here @xmath21 is a unit vector in the direction of the local fermi velocity @xmath22 note that @xmath23 is defined in terms of the gradient of the _ bare energy dispersion _ at the _ renormalized fermi surface_. the solution of eq.([eq : fsdef ] ) can be parameterized as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a unit vector in the direction of @xmath19 , see fig.[fig : fs ] . note that only for a spherical fermi surface we may identify @xmath26 , so that @xmath19 and @xmath23 are parallel . in this case we know that @xmath19 is not renormalized as we turn on the interactions at constant density @xcite . the true fermi surface is then given by @xmath27 ( where @xmath28 is the chemical potential of the non - interacting system at the same density ) , so that @xmath29 , which is independent of @xmath19 .    for the derivation of the rg flow equations it is convenient to represent the generating functionals of the fermionic correlation functions in terms of grassmannian functional integrals @xcite . we assume that initially the grassmann fields @xmath30 with large excitation energies @xmath31 and large matsubara frequencies @xmath32 have been integrated out . here @xmath33 is a composite label , and for simplicity we ignore the spin degree of freedom . the high energy shell can be described by an equation of the form @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is a suitable homogeneous function of @xmath36 or @xmath37 . possible choices are @xmath38 , @xmath39 . our starting point is an effective action of the form @xmath40 where the free part is given by @xmath41 \bar{\psi}_k \psi_{k }    \ ; . \nonumber   \\   & &   \label{eq : s0def }   \end{aligned}\ ] ] here we use the notation @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the inverse temperature and @xmath44 is the volume , and the right -

body and higher order interactions , and @xmath48 all vertices are antisymmetric with respect to the permutation of any pair of the incoming particles and any pair of the outgoing particles . in particular , the four - point vertex @xmath49 is antisymmetric with respect to the exchange @xmath50 and @xmath51 . the function @xmath52 is a smooth cutoff function , satisfying @xmath53 for @xmath54 and @xmath55 for @xmath56 , so that @xmath57 . the term @xmath58 in eq.([eq : sint ] ) is the contribution from the high energy fields with @xmath59 to the irreducible self - energy , and @xmath60 is a counterterm which takes into account that in the free action ( [ eq : s0def ] ) we have subtracted @xmath61 from the bare energy dispersion . as shown below , this subtraction is crucial to obtain the rg flow of the fermi surface . in a perturbative approach , the above subtraction is necessary to obtain a well - behaved perturbation series @xcite . the counterterm @xmath60 can be determined from a self - consistency condition , which can be imposed order by order in perturbation theory @xcite . within a rg approach , the counterterm can be determined a posteriori from the condition that the flow equation of the momentum- and frequency - independent part of the irreducible two - point vertex has a fixed point @xcite , see sec.[sec : fsshape ] for a careful discussion . the energy scale @xmath62 plays a dual role @xcite : for the calculation of the vertices of the initial action @xmath63 the scale @xmath62 acts as an _ infrared _ cutoff , so that for sufficiently large @xmath62 the vertices appearing in @xmath64 can be calculated perturbatively . on the other hand , for the remaining low - energy degrees of freedom @xmath62 plays the role of an _ ultraviolet _ cutoff . starting from the effective action @xmath65 with cutoff @xmath62 , we eliminate all fields with momenta and matsubara frequencies in the regime @xmath66 . the free propagator for the fermionic fields in this regime has in the @xmath67-basis the diagonal elements @xmath68 because @xmath69 lies by construction on the true fermi surface of the _ interacting _ system , the right - hand side of eq.([eq : propdef ] ) depends implicitly on the interaction . note , however , that @xmath70 is independent of the flow parameter @xmath71 . diagrammatically , the elimination of the degrees of freedom in the shell @xmath66 corresponds to contracting all terms generated by expanding @xmath72 with the propagators @xmath73 given in eq.([eq : propdef ] ) . the connected correlation functions of the new theory can be formally represented as functional derivatives of the generating functional @xmath74 defined by @xcite @xmath75 _ { \psi = g^0_{\xi , \xi_0 } j }   \ ; . \nonumber   \\   & &   \label{eq : gcdef }   \end{aligned}\ ] ] here @xmath76 , and the factor @xmath77 arises from the antisymmetry of the grassmann fields @xcite . @xmath73 should be considered as a matrix in @xmath67-space , with matrix elements given by @xmath78 _ { k k^{\prime } } = \delta_{k   k^{\prime } }   g^0_{\xi , \xi_0 } ( k )   \ ; , \ ] ] where @xmath79 is defined in eq.([eq : propdef ] ) .    differentiating both sides of eq.([eq : gcdef ] ) with respect to @xmath71 , we obtain an exact flow equation for the generating functional of the connected correlation functions . for practical calculations the flow equation for the irreducible vertices is more convenient @xcite . to obtain the corresponding generating functional , we perform a legendre transformation , @xmath80 where the grassmann sources @xmath81 and @xmath82 have to be considered as functionals of the grassmann fields @xmath13 and @xmath83 by solving the following equations for @xmath84 and @xmath85 , @xmath86 the generating functional of the irreducible vertices is then given by @xmath87^{-1 } \varphi )   \ ; , \ ] ] and satisfies the exact flow equation @xcite @xmath88^{-1 }    \nonumber   \\   & \times &     \left\ {    \hat{g}_{\xi , \xi_0 }   \hat{\cal{u}}_{\xi }    [ \hat{1 } -

point vertex @xcite . the exact flow equation for the six - point vertex is rather lengthy and is given in the appendix . so far we have derived exact flow equations for the irreducible vertices describing the elimination of the degrees of freedom . within the one - loop approximation , it is sufficient to set @xmath114 for @xmath115 , and to ignore interaction corrections to the propagators in internal loops . the resulting truncated flow equation for the four - point vertex in two dimensions has been analyzed numerically by honerkamp et al.@xcite . a similar numerical analysis of an equivalent truncated flow equation has been performed by halboth and metzner @xcite . both groups found that the one - loop flow of the four - point vertex eventually diverges at a finite scale , where the perturbative rg breaks down . physically the runaway flow has been interpreted in terms of some incipient instability of the normal metallic phase . here we would like to point out that in principle there is another interpretation of this runaway flow , namely the existence of a scale - invariant non - fermi liquid fixed point , which is characterized by a finite anomalous dimension . below we argue that the mode elimination rg transformations of refs.@xcite can not detect such a fixed point , because these equations do not take into account that the degrees of freedom should be properly rescaled to reach a fixed point with a finite anomalous dimension @xcite . assuming the existence of such a fixed point , only the rescaled version of the exact flow equations given below would detect it , while the pure mode elimination rg used in refs.@xcite would still exhibit a runaway flow to strong coupling . because the following rescaling procedure depends crucially on the existence of a fermi surface , we now explicitly set the statistics factor @xmath77 . we also take the limits of infinite volume ( @xmath46 ) and zero temperature ( @xmath45 ) , so that momenta and frequencies become continuous variables .      instead of the momentum @xmath1 and the matsubara frequency @xmath116 , we now label the degrees of freedom by the direction @xmath25 of @xmath19 ( see fig.[fig : fs ] ) and by the dimensionless variables @xmath117 so that @xmath118 furthermore , instead of the flow parameter @xmath71 , we introduce the dimensionless logarithmic flow parameter @xmath119 and define the dimensionless dispersion @xmath120 where @xmath121 is an irrelevant coupling which measures the leading deviation from linearity in the energy dispersion in the direction normal to the fermi surface . in eq.([eq : xitqdef ] ) we have expanded the energy dispersion around @xmath122 , @xmath123 note that in general @xmath23 and @xmath124 depend on @xmath25 . using @xmath125 instead of @xmath126 as integration variables , we have for @xmath45 and @xmath46 @xmath127 where @xmath128 is a surface element and @xmath129 is the surface area of the unit sphere in @xmath130 dimensions , and @xmath131 is a dimensionless jacobian associated with the transformation @xmath132 . for convenience we have pulled out a factor of @xmath133 in eq.([eq : measure ] ) , where @xmath134 is the density of states at the fermi surface , @xmath135 with this normalization @xmath136 is dimensionless . in particular , for a spherical fermi surface @xmath137      the proper definition of the dimensionless scaling form of the irreducible vertices follows partially from dimensional analysis , and partially from aesthetic considerations ( such as the requirement that numerical prefactors should be as simple as possible ) . given the expansion ( [ eq : gammaexpand ] ) of the generating functional of the irreducible vertices in powers of the dimensionful fields @xmath138 , we substitute @xmath139 where the wave - function renormalization factor @xmath140 is related to the irreducible self - energy @xmath141 at scale @xmath71 as usual , @xmath142 the dimensionless fields @xmath143 should be considered as functions of the scaling variables @xmath144 .      due to the jacobian associated with the rescaling of fermionic fields in the functional integral , the field - independent part @xmath145 of the generating functional @xmath146 picks up an additive term , so that after rescaling the correction to the free energy is @xmath147 in classical statistical mechanics a contribution analogous to the second term has been discussed by wegner and houghton @xcite . we write the exact propagator in the following scaling form , @xmath148 where @xmath25 should be considered as a function of @xmath1 , as given in eqs.([eq : kfdef ] ) and ( [ eq : kfsol ] ) . note that our exact rg equations describe the flow of the _ dimensionless scaling function _ @xmath149 introducing the dimensionless scaling form of the ( subtracted ) irreducible two -

linearity of this transformation , the explicit expression of @xmath177 in terms of @xmath178 and @xmath179 is rather complicated . for example , let us calculate @xmath180 in the zero - sound contribution involving @xmath181 . the energy component is simple , @xmath182 , but for @xmath183 and @xmath184 we obtain @xmath185 @xmath186   \label{eq : qprimedef }   \ ; , \ ] ] where @xmath187 , see eq.([eq : ctdef ] ) . for simplicity we have assumed a spherical fermi surface , so that @xmath188 . note that the corresponding rescaled energy dispersion is @xmath189 the rescaled flow equation for the six - point vertex is given in the appendix . in this section we discuss several properties of the rescaled flow equations of sec.[sec : rescale ] , and argue that for practical calculations it may be advantageous to use the rescaled flow equations instead of the unrescaled equations discussed in sec.[sec : mode ] . as pointed out in refs.@xcite , the unrescaled flow equations predict pathological rg flows for physical quantities which are determined by degrees of freedom in the immediate vicinity of the fermi surface , such as uniform susceptibilities : for any finite infrared cutoff @xmath71 uniform susceptibilities are not renormalized at all , while at @xmath190 their rg flow exhibits a discontinuity . although for a fermi liquid one may use the fermi liquid relations between the uniform susceptibilities and the quasi - particle interactions to obtain flow equations for the susceptibilities at finite cutoff @xmath71 @xcite , it would be better to calculate uniform susceptibilities entirely within the framework of the exact rg , without relying on the assumption that the system is a fermi liquid .    to illustrate the above point , let us consider the screening of the effective interaction , which is closely related to the density - density correlation function . the screening problem has also been considered by shankar ( see appendix a of ref.@xcite ) within the field theory version of the rg , and by dupuis @xcite within the conventional kadanoff - wilson rg scheme for fermi liquids . consider the flow equation ( [ eq : flowgamma4 ] ) for the irreducible four - point vertex . suppose we start from a bare interaction at scale @xmath62 of the form @xmath191 let us now calculate the flow of the effective interaction within the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) , where the bcs - contribution is ignored and only those zero - sound terms are retained which preserve the form ( [ eq : bare ] ) . setting for simplicity @xmath192 and @xmath193 ( this is the combination appearing in the flow equation ( [ eq : flowgamma2 ] ) for the self - energy ) we approximate the irreducible four - point vertex at scale @xmath194 by @xmath195 where we have assumed @xmath196 . in this approximation we obtain from eq.([eq : flowgamma4 ] ) @xmath197 where the change of the polarization is given by @xmath198   \ ; . \nonumber   \\   & &   \label{eq : pidot }   \end{aligned}\ ] ] within the rpa we ignore the self - energy corrections to the propagators in eq.([eq : pidot ] ) . using the cutoff function @xmath199 , we obtain for @xmath200 @xmath201 obviously , @xmath202 for any @xmath203 , so that the rpa interaction @xmath204 is not renormalized for any finite @xmath71 . due to the factor @xmath205 in eq.([eq : pidotrpa ] ) the rg flow of the rpa interaction @xmath204 ( and hence the flow of the polarization and the compressibility ) is discontinuous at @xmath190 . this discontinuity is smoothed out if one works at a finite temperature @xcite , but there is a way to avoid discontinuous flow equations at zero temperature : the rg flow equations generated by our rescaled version of the exact rg remain continuous even at @xmath206 . we now explicitly show this for the rg - flow of the rescaled density - density correlation function . within the rpa this the rescaled four - point vertex is approximated by @xmath207 where the dimensionless function @xmath208 satisfies the flow equation @xmath209    f_t^{-1 } ( q_1 , q_2 ) = - \dot{\tilde{\pi}}_t ( q_1 , q_2 )   \ ; ,   \label{eq : flowcontinuous}\ ] ] which is the rescaled analog of eq.([eq : rpaflow ] ) . here @xmath210_{k^{\prime }   = k + k_1 - k_2 }   \ ; ,   \label{eq : pidot2}\ ] ] where @xmath211 is defined as a function of @xmath212 , @xmath213 and @xmath214 via @xmath215 , as explained in sec.[subsec : flowvertexrescale ] . ignoring again interaction corrections to the propagators and working with the momentum shell @xmath216 @xmath217 substituting these expressions into eq.([eq : pidot2 ] ) and performing the integrations over @xmath218 and @xmath219 we obtain @xmath220 where we have used eq.([eq : xiprime ] ) to simplify @xmath221 for small @xmath222 , @xmath223 the crucial point is now that , unlike eq.([eq : pidotrpa ] ) , the right - hand side of eq.([eq : pidotscale ] ) is a non - singular function of the flow - parameter @xmath8 . in fact , in dimensions @xmath224 the @xmath225-function discontinuity of the integrand disappears after the angular integration , so that @xmath226 is a continuous function of @xmath8 . but even in @xmath227 , where the angular integration should be replaced by a summation over the two discrete fermi points , there is no discontinuity in the solution of the flow equation ( [ eq : flowcontinuous ] ) . it is instructive to elaborate a little bit more on the case @xmath227 , where we obtain from eq.([eq : pidotscale ] ) @xmath228 in deriving this expression we have assumed @xmath229 , and have neglected the terms with @xmath230 , which vanish exponentially for @xmath9 . note that the right - hand side of eq.([eq : pidotscale1 ] ) has discontinuities , but no @xmath231-function singularity , in contrast to eq.([eq : pidotrpa ] ) . it follows that the flow of the physical density - density correlation function is continuous . to see this , let us explicitly solve eq.([eq : flowcontinuous ] ) . using the method described in ref.@xcite , the solution with the correct initial condition is easily obtained , @xmath232 substituting eq.([eq : pidotscale1 ] ) into eq.([eq : ftsolutionscale ] ) we finally obtain in @xmath233 @xmath234 where @xmath235   \label{eq : piflow1res }   \ ; . \end{aligned}\ ] ] note that the function @xmath236 is continuous , so that the right - hand side of eq.([eq : piflow1res ] ) is indeed a continuous function of @xmath8 . the physical density - density correlation function is then @xmath237   \label{eq : unrescale }   \ ; . \end{aligned}\ ] ] taking the limits @xmath238 and @xmath239 we obtain the well - known result @xmath240 from the first line in eq.([eq : unrescale ] ) it is clear why our rescaled flow equations are more suitable for the calculation of the susceptibilities than the corresponding unrescaled flow equations : because the dependence of the density - density correlation function on the infrared cutoff appears in the scaling function @xmath241 via the ratios @xmath242 and @xmath243 , the result for uniform susceptibilities depends on the order in which the limits @xmath244 and @xmath239 are taken . our rescaled rg equation directly yields the _ scaling function _ @xmath241 where this problem does not arise . let us give an alternative explanation for this difference : in the unrescaled flow equations the momenta and frequencies are held constant as the infrared cutoff is reduced . any fixed distance from the fermi surface is therefore magnified on the scale of the reduced infrared cutoff , so that momenta that are initially close to the fermi surface are mapped onto new momenta which , on the reduced scale , appear further away from the fermi surface . on the other hand , in the rescaled flow equations the momenta and frequencies are scaled down together with the infrared cutoff , so that the degrees of freedom that are initially in the vicinity of the fermi surface are mapped onto coarse grained degrees of freedom that remain close to the fermi surface . as already emphasized in sec.[subsec : fs ] , to obtain well - behaved scaling properties we should expand the bare energy dispersion around the true fermi surface of the interacting many - body problem , which a priori is not known . we now show how the shape of the fermi surface can be calculated a posteriori from the fixed point equation for the momentum- and frequency - independent part of the irreducible two - point vertex , @xmath245 note that this is a relevant coupling function ( labeled by the direction @xmath25 ) with scaling dimension @xmath246 . there are two marginal coupling functions associated with the two - point vertex . one of them is the usual wave - function renormalization given in eq.([eq : zdef ] ) . in terms of our rescaled two - point vertex it can also be written as @xmath247 the other marginal coupling can be taken to be the dimensionless renormalization factor of the fermi velocity @xmath248 the rg flow of the shape of the fermi surface of strongly correlated electrons in reduced dimensions have recently been considered by several authors @xcite . however , the interpretation of the renormalized fermi surface in terms of a rg fixed point manifold has only been emphasized by shankar @xcite , who used the conventional one - loop momentum shell technique , including the rescaling step . in contrast , the authors of ref.@xcite work with unrescaled flow equations , in which case the coupling corresponding to eq.([eq : mutildedef ] ) does not flow to a rg fixed point , so that the interpretation of the fermi surface as a rg fixed point manifold is obscured .    to study the shape of the fermi surface within the exact rg , let us retain only relevant and marginal couplings in the two - point function . in this approximation @xmath249 it is convenient to define the fermi surface momenta @xmath250 of the system with cutoff @xmath251 in analogy with eq.([eq : fsdef ] ) , @xmath252 so that the true renormalized fermi surface is @xmath253 , see eq.([eq : fsdef ] ) . in order to calculate @xmath254 we use the fact that by construction @xmath218 in eq.([eq : rtapprox ] ) is measured relative to the renormalized @xmath19 , so that we obtain from the definition ( [ eq : fsflow ] ) , up to irrelevant terms , @xmath255 setting @xmath256 we obtain for the difference between the fully renormalized fermi momentum @xmath19 and the fermi momentum @xmath257 of the model with cutoff @xmath62 , @xmath258 it should be kept in mind that @xmath23 is defined in terms of the gradient of the _ bare _ energy dispersion at the _ from eqs.([eq : gammatdef ] ) and ( [ eq : mutildedef ] ) we find @xmath259   \ ; ,   \label{eq : countermu}\ ] ] which allows us to reconstruct the counterterm @xmath100 as follows : suppose that we have adjusted the initial condition @xmath260 such that for @xmath9 the relevant couplings @xmath261 approach a fixed point . due to the relevance of @xmath261 , we expect that this requires some fine tuning of the initial @xmath260 , so that on the critical manifold ( i.e. the manifold in parameter space that flows into a rg fixed point ) @xmath260 becomes a function of the other relevant and marginal couplings . from eq.([eq : countermu ] ) we then obtain the counterterm @xmath100 as a function of these couplings . note that if we adjust the initial conditions such that @xmath262 remains finite for @xmath9 , then eq.([eq : kfren ] ) guarantees that for @xmath263 the flowing @xmath250 indeed approaches the true fermi surface . _ thus , the problem of constructing the renormalized fermi surface can be reduced to the problem of finding the rg fixed point of the flow equation for the relevant coupling function @xmath264 . _    the above discussion relies on the approximation ( [ eq : rtapprox ] ) for the inverse propagator , which is only justified for a fermi liquid . in principle it is also possible that the system flows to a non - fermi liquid fixed point , characterized by some new renormalized fermi surface . as pointed out by anderson @xcite , in this case there might be some subtleties related to the subtraction of the counterterm @xmath100 . it is also worth emphasizing the following point : in order to reach a rg fixed point , it is crucial that the bare energy dispersion is expanded around the fully _ renormalized _ fermi surface @xmath19 , defined in eq.([eq : fsdef ] ) . if we had chosen the bare fermi surface @xmath257 as the reference for the expansion , then the rg flow of the relevant coupling @xmath261 would exhibit a runaway flow , i.e. @xmath265 for @xmath9 . to see this , suppose that we expand around the initial fermi surface at scale @xmath62 . then the relation ( [ eq : kfren ] ) between the renormalized and the bare fermi momentum is replaced by @xmath266 where @xmath267 . given that @xmath250 approaches for large @xmath8 a value that is different from the bare @xmath257 , we see from eq.([eq : kfren2 ] ) that @xmath268 must necessarily diverge as @xmath269 ( assuming that @xmath270 remains finite ) . this runaway flow indicates that we have expanded around the wrong fermi surface . this phenomenon is well known from the usual theory of critical phenomena , where the fixed point manifold is discrete : in this case a runaway flow indicates the existence of some new fixed point . what is new here is that the fixed point manifold is a continuum , which can therefore continuously change under rg transformations . to avoid a runaway flow , we have to expand all quantities from the beginning around the true fermi surface , which can be determined a posteriori from the requirement that the rg flow indeed approaches a fixed point . long time ago bell and wilson @xcite pointed out that the field rescaling ( see step 3 in sec.[sec : intro ] ) is necessary in order to obtain a non - trivial rg fixed point , characterized by a non - zero anomalous dimension @xmath7 . in fact , the rg fixed point conditions can be viewed as some sort of non - linear eigenvalue equations , which contain @xmath7 as an adjustable parameter @xcite . from this point of view it is not surprising @xcite that solutions of the fixed point equations exist only for certain values of @xmath7 , depending on the interaction , the dimensionality , and the symmetries of the system . we believe that the above statement is also true for fermionic many - body systems , so that the unrescaled flow equations used in refs.@xcite can not be used to detect non - fermi liquid fixed points .    because within a one - loop approximation the anomalous dimension vanishes , at the first sight it seems that at this level of approximation it is sufficient to work with a pure mode - elimination rg @xcite . this is not necessarily true , however , because even at the one - loop level the rescaling of momenta and frequencies ( see step 2 in sec.[sec : intro ] ) can be essential to obtain a non - trivial rg fixed point . for example , consider @xmath271-theory slightly below @xmath272 dimensions . in this case there are two relevant couplings , namely the momentum - independent part of the irreducible two - point vertex @xmath273 , and the momentum - independent part of the irreducible four - point vertex @xmath274 . the one - loop rg flow equations for suitably defined @xcite dimensionless couplings are well known @xcite @xmath275 for @xmath276 these equations have a non - trivial fixed point at @xmath277 which arises from a _ balance between the competing effects _ due to the scaling terms ( i.e. the first terms on the right - hand sides of eqs.([eq : muflow ] ) and ( [ eq : gflow ] ) ) and the mode elimination terms ( i.e. the second terms on the right - hand sides of eqs.([eq : muflow ] ) and ( [ eq : gflow ] ) ) . obviously , a rg transformation which includes only the mode elimination would miss the wilson - fisher fixed point .    finally , we point out that the rescaling of momenta and frequencies plays also an important role to accelerate the flow of the irrelevant couplings to negligibly small values . for example , the constant part of the rescaled irreducible six - point vertex @xmath278 is irrelevant with scaling dimension @xmath279 . this @xmath279 appears as the first term on the right - hand side of eq.([eq : sixpointscale ] ) , and causes the size of the rescaled six - point vertex to diminish exponentially as we iterate the rg ( as long as this decrease is not overwhelmed by some anomalous dimension ) . on the other hand , the corresponding flow equation ( [ eq : sixpoint ] ) for the unrescaled six - point vertex does not exhibit a similar suppression due to a negative scaling dimension , so that there is no guarantee that the unrescaled six - point vertex really becomes small as we iterate the rg transformation . in this work we have constructed exact functional rg equations for non - relativistic fermions , taking not only the mode elimination into account , but also the rescaling of momenta , frequencies , and fields . the exact flow equations given in this work are valid in arbitrary dimensions and describe the rg flow of any translationally invariant fermionic many - body system in the normal state . we emphasize that these equations are exact and describe the rg flow of the irreducible correlation functions of the many - body system for all momenta and frequencies . of course , it is possible to extract the usual perturbative rg @xmath43-function describing the flow of the momentum - independent part of the four - point vertex from these flow equations . to obtain the @xmath43-function at the two - loop order , it is sufficient to truncate the infinite hierarchy of flow equations by setting @xmath280 for @xmath281 . in sections [ subsec : sharp ] , [ subsec : flowvertexrescale ] and in the appendix we have explicitly written down all expressions necessary for performing a two - loop calculation for any @xmath130-dimensional translationally invariant normal fermionic many - body system . these equations are also valid in @xmath227 , where two - loop calculations are usually performed using the field theory - method @xcite . note , however , that in this case there are some subtleties which are not fully understood @xcite .    we have formulated the exact functional rg for fermionic systems in close analogy with the functional rg for field theories and statistical mechanics problems . we have tried to emphasize this analogy by adopting as much as possible the notation used in statistical mechanics @xcite . a crucial step is the introduction of dimensionless scaling variables and rescaled vertices , which describe the scaling towards the true fermi surface of the system . finally , in sec.[sec : advantages ] we have shown that the rescaled flow equations for the irreducible vertices given in sec.[subsec : flowvertexrescale ] have several advantages as compared with the unrescaled flow equations discussed in sec.[subsec : sharp ] :    1 . _ flow of susceptibilities . _ the unrescaled exact rg equations used in refs . @xcite yield discontinuities in flow equations for quantities which are dominated by degrees of freedom in the immediate vicinity of the fermi surface , such as the density - density correlation function at long wavelengths . in contrast , our formulation of the exact rg including rescaling yields flow equations which are continuous functions of the flow parameter . renormalization of the shape of the fermi surface . _ the calculation of the shape of the renormalized fermi surface can be reduced to the solution of the fixed point equation for the properly rescaled irreducible two - point vertex at vanishing external momentum and frequency . without rescaling , the corresponding flow equation does not have a fixed point , so that the associated relevant coupling exhibits a runaway flow . non - fermi liquid fixed points . _ if the system has a scale invariant non - fermi liquid fixed point characterized by a non - zero anomalous dimension @xmath7 , then the flow generated by rg transformations which omit the rescaling steps 2 and 3 listed in sec.[sec : intro ] can not detect this fixed point . instead , the pure mode elimination rg calculations of the type used in refs.@xcite would generate a runaway - flow to strong coupling in this case . we suspect that our rescaled flow equations will also turn out to be advantageous for numerical calculations , because they describe the rg flow of the relevant scaling functions . the numerical analysis of these equations is a rather tedious task @xcite , which is beyond the scope of this work . our flow equations also offer a new approach to study interacting fermions in @xmath282 , where the normal metallic state is known to be a non - fermi liquid . for these systems the rg @xmath43-function is often calculated within the field theory formulation of the rg advanced by slyom @xcite . however , till now there exists no rg calculation of the full momentum- and frequency - dependent single - particle green function of interacting fermions in @xmath227 . from bosonization it is known that in momentum - frequency space the single - particle green function exhibits interesting features such as power - law singularities , which are a manifestation of anomalous scaling and spin - charge - separation @xcite . we are currently investigating whether the full spectral function of interacting fermions in @xmath227 can be calculated by means of an approximate solution of the rescaled functional rg equation ( [ eq : twopointscale ] ) for the two - point vertex . we have preliminary evidence @xcite that at weak coupling this can indeed be done , and that for the tomonaga - luttinger model the resulting spectral function compares quite well with the exact result obtained via bosonization . finally , we would like to address the question whether possible scale - invariant non - fermi liquid fixed points in dimensions @xmath224 are accessible within the exact rg . certainly , detecting such a fixed point requires at least a two - loop calculation , because at the one - loop level the wave - function renormalization @xmath140 remains unity . considering the complexity of numerical analysis of the one - loop equations describing the rg flow without the rescaling steps @xcite , the direct numerical analysis of the two - loop rg flow equations including rescaling seems to be a rather difficult task . such a calculation would require the numerical analysis of the flow equation for the six - point vertex given in eq . ( [ eq : sixpointscale ] ) . note , however , that in the special case of a square fermi surface binz , baeriswyl and douot @xcite have recently presented an analytic study of the one - loop rg flow in the vicinity of the dominant instabilities . let us emphasize again that @xmath283 at a non - fermi liquid fixed point , so that the inclusion of the flow of the wave - function renormalization is crucial to reach such a fixed point .    for fermi surfaces with a special geometry it is possible to analyze the rg flow analytically @xcite . in particular , very recently ferraz @xcite performed a field - theoretic two - loop rg calculation for a two - dimensional fermi system with a truncated fermi surface , consisting of flat and curved pieces . he succeeded to calculate the entire single - particle spectral function . interestingly , he found non - fermi liquid behavior for all points on the fermi surface , including the curved pieces . the calculations presented in ref . @xcite are quite encouraging and support our point of view that higher - dimensional non - fermi liquid fixed points are accessible within a two - loop truncation of the wilsonian rg equations presented in this work . we thank b. binz , a. ferraz , c. honerkamp , v. meden , m. salmhofer , and k. schnhammer for discussions , and n. dupuis for pointing out some relevant references . this work was financially supported by the dfg - schwerpunkt ssp 1053 , project no.scho201/8-1 . for a two - loop calculation we need the flow equation for the irreducible six - point vertex @xcite . the unrescaled flow equation reads ( see fig.[fig : sixpoint ] and recall that for fermions @xmath77 ) @xmath284 _ { k^{\prime } = k_1^{\prime } + k_2^{\prime } - k }   \right . \nonumber   \\   &   &    \hspace{-38 mm } \left . + { \cal{a}}_{1 , ( 3 , 2 ) }    \left [   \gamma^{(6 ) } _ { \xi }   ( k_1^{\prime } , k_2^{\prime } , k_3^{\prime } ;

The authors introduce the exact functional RG, which is a functional of the generating functional of the irreducible two-point vertex, and derive its flow equations. They also discuss the rescaling of degrees of freedom to obtain a non-trivial RG fixed point, which is characterized by a non-zero anomalous dimension.

The authors argue that the exact RG methods are incomplete","we construct exact functional renormalization group ( rg ) flow equations for non - relativistic fermions in arbitrary dimensions , taking into account not only mode elimination but also the rescaling of the momenta , frequencies and the fermionic fields . 
 the complete rg flow of all relevant , marginal and irrelevant couplings can be described by a system of coupled flow equations for the irreducible @xmath0-point vertices . introducing suitable dimensionless variables , we obtain flow equations for generalized scaling functions which are _ continuous _ functions of the flow parameter , even if we consider quantities which are dominated by momenta close to the fermi surface , such as the density - density correlation function at long wavelengths . 
 we also show how the problem of constructing the renormalized fermi surface can be reduced to the problem of finding the rg fixed point of the irreducible two - point vertex at vanishing momentum and frequency . 
 we argue that only if the degrees of freedom are properly rescaled it is possible to reach scale - invariant non - fermi liquid fixed points within a truncation of the exact rg flow equations .

"since the discovery of ultra - compact dwarf galaxies ( ucds ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , it is still a complicated puzzle in extragalactic astronomy how such compact and luminous objects may have formed . they are brighter and larger than globular clusters ( gcs ) @xcite and much smaller than early - type dwarf galaxies ( des ) in both size and luminosity . a number of studies targeting various ucd samples in different galaxy clusters also revealed the diverse nature of ucds : fornax ucds are slightly redder on average than virgo ucds @xcite . on the other hand , it is still a matter of debate whether or not the ucds contain dark matter @xcite . this makes them very special objects to study in extragalactic astronomy , suggesting that the presence of dark matter or not can be directly related to whether ucds have a galactic origin or not . overall it has been already noted that virgo ucds contain fairly old ( age : @xmath0 8 - 10 gyr ) and metal poor ( @xmath10.5 dex ) stellar populations ( * ? ? ? * hereafter e07 ) . therefore , it is also proposed that they could be very luminous intra - cluster gcs @xcite . another popular formation scenario is the threshing of nucleated des @xcite . in this picture , ucds are the remnants of galaxies that have been significantly stripped in the cluster environment . numerical simulations @xcite have generally confirmed that the remnant nuclei resemble ucds in their structural parameters . stellar population studies of des provide evidence that the nuclei have intermediate ages and moderately metal - enriched stellar populations @xcite . in addition to this , since ucds show slightly super solar [ @xmath2/fe ] abundances , @xcite argued that the stellar population properties rather support the view that ucds are luminous globular clusters than being nuclei of des .    in this letter , we present a stellar population analysis based on absorption - line strengths ( lick indices , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) of a fairly large sample of 34 nucleated des and 10 ucds in the virgo cluster . so far , studies comparing stellar population parameters derived from spectra used rather low numbers of objects . moreover , the extraction of nuclear spectra has been made without subtracting the underlying galactic light , which can still contribute significantly at the photometric center of the des . we therefore apply a simple method to subtract most of this light ( see section [ reduc ] ) , thus expecting that our measurements are representative for the stellar population properties of the nuclei themselves . finally , we present the distributions of the stellar population parameters of de nuclei and ucds with respect to local galaxy density and to their luminosity , and we try to constrain possible formation scenarios of virgo ucds . to values brighter than 21 mag , and the `` nucleus strength '' , i.e.  the value of @xmath3 to less than -1 . note that the nucleus sample is not complete within this parameter region , i.e.  not all virgo de nuclei with these parameters have been observed.,width=302 ]      our de sample comprises 34 nucleated des in the virgo cluster ( virgo cluster catalog , vcc , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , selected to have a relatively high `` nucleus strength '' ( details of the sample see , * ? ? ? * ) , which we define as the difference between the nucleus magnitude and the host galaxy effective surface brightness , @xmath4 , measured in sdss @xmath5 ( see below ) . thereby , @xmath6 is a measure for the brightness of a unit area of the galaxy , determining the `` contrast '' between galaxy and nucleus ( also see @xcite , their fig . 1 ) . we select nuclei with @xmath7 and @xmath8 mag ( see fig . [ his ] ) .    our ucd sample selection ( see table 1 ) , is based on @xcite and @xcite ; our numbering follows the latter . three of the nine virgo ucds of jones et al . were not included in the lick index study of evstigneeva et al . ( vucd2 , 8 , and 9 ) , so they were selected by us as targets . three further ucds were selected , since they fell in the same field - of - view as de targets of our study . due to the multi - slit observations , they could be easily included . we also targeted a new virgo ucd candidate , which we now indeed confirm as virgo cluster member ; it is named vucd10 in table 1 . it was identified through a simple multiparameter selection procedure . from sdss dr5 pipeline photometry , we obtained @xmath9 magnitudes and colors for all nine virgo ucds in @xcite . when excluding vucd7 , which is clearly brighter than the others and appears to be an extended object in the sdss images ( also see @xcite ) , the _ r_-band magnitudes ( sdss `` modelmag '' values ) lie within 18.0 to 19.1 mag . their petrosian radii in @xmath5 , again excluding vucd7 , are below 2.2 arcsec . their _ u - r _ colors , when excluding the much redder vucd3 , cover the range 1.8 to 2.4 mag ( which includes vucd7 ) . their _ i - z _ colors , again excluding vucd3 , lie between 0.1 and 0.25 mag ( which again includes vucd7 ) . the right ascension and declination of all objects except vucd3 and vucd7 ranges from 187.5@xmath10 to 188.1@xmath10 and 11.9@xmath10 to 12.7@xmath10 , respectively . when querying the sdss database for all objects fulfilling the above criteria of magnitude , radius , color , and position , 20 objects were identified that the sdss classified as stars , among them vucd1 , 2 , and 5 . the same query , but for objects classified as galaxies , yielded only five objects : vucd4 , 6 , 8 , 9 , and the new vucd10 , which we therefore included in our target sample .    with its radial velocity of 2425 km / s that we now measured from its spectrum , it is consistent with being a virgo cluster member : in velocity space , virgo member galaxies in the central cluster region reach velocities of 2600 km / s ( @xcite ) . we therefore consider vucd10 a new virgo cluster ucd , and include it in the following analysis . to obtain nucleus and ucd magnitudes , we use sdss dr5 @xmath5-band images to which we applied our own sky subtraction procedure ( see * ? ? ? we also correct them for galactic extinction , following @xcite , and use the flux calibration provided directly by the sdss . a virgo distance modulus of @xmath11 mag @xcite , corresponding to @xmath12 mpc and an sdss pixel scale of 32 pc ( 80 pc/ "" ) , is adopted here and in the further analysis . nucleus magnitudes are derived as follows . a srsic fit to the radial profile of the galaxy is done , measured with elliptical annuli and using only the radial interval from 2 `` to 1/3 of the half - light radius , or extending it if the interval subtends less than 2.5 '' ( 200 pc ) . from this fit , a two - dimensional elliptical model image , taking into account the median sdss psf of 1.4 "" fwhm , is created and subtracted from the original image , leaving only the nucleus in the center . the nucleus magnitude is then measured by circular aperture photometry with @xmath13 . we estimate the magnitude error to be 0.2 mag , which is consistent with the rms scatter of a comparison to the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ acs virgo cluster survey @xcite for the 10 objects in common . magnitudes were converted into @xmath14 by adding the @xmath15 color value of the nucleated de s center ( @xmath16 ) , and were then compared to acs @xmath14 magnitudes , showing no systematic offset . ] the same aperture photometry is done to obtain ucd magnitudes . to be comparable to the nucleus measurements , this aperture is also applied to vucd7 , even though it is known to be extended , as mentioned previously . for the ucd magnitudes we estimate an error of 0.1 mag . the spectroscopic observations were carried out at eso very large telescope ( vlt ) with fors2 . the 1 "" slit and v300 grism provide an instrumental resolution @xmath1711  fwhm . details of the observational layout and data reduction are described in ( * ? ? ? * hereafter p10 ) . our data was obtained in two observing runs , using the same instrumental setup . the first set of des ( 26 objects , see p10 ) was observed in the semester 2007a , and the second set ( 8 des ) in 2010a . in total our sample covers the full range of local projected galaxy density that is populated by nucleated des in virgo , from less than 10 to more than 100 galaxies per square degree . the ucds were observed in 2007a together with the first set of des , using the same instrumental configuration . we provide the basic properties such as position and radial velocity in table [ ucds ] and the detailed ucd sample selection criteria in section [ scucd ] . while the nucleus typically contributes the majority of light at the photometric center of the des , still a considerable amount of underlying galactic light of the host galaxy could alter the actual properties of the nuclei . therefore , we attempt to subtract the galactic light from the nuclear spectra . this is done by inward extrapolation of the exponentially - fitted light profile of the host galaxy along the slit , yielding the amount of galaxy light contained in the nucleus extraction aperture of 0``.75 ( central 3 pixels ) . the galaxy spectrum is extracted in a radial interval from 3 '' to 8 "" , scaled accordingly , and subtracted from the centrally extracted spectrum . further details of this process are given in paudel et al . ( 2010b , submitted to mnras ) . while certainly not being perfect , we expect that this approach removes most of the galactic light contamination and thus provides spectra that are fairly well representative for the stellar population properties of de nuclei . llllllllll ucds & ra & dec & rv & age & [ z / h ] & [ @xmath2/fe ] & m@xmath18 & remark + name & ( h : m : s ) & ( @xmath19 :  : "") & ( kms ) & gyr & dex & dex & mag & +    vucd1 & 12:30:07.61 & 12:36:31.10 & 1227.8 @xmath20 1.7 & 11.9@xmath21 & -0.90 @xmath20 0.05 & 0.38 @xmath20 0.09 & 18.6 & e07 + vucd2 & 12:30:48.24 & 12:35:11.10 & 911 @xmath20 6 & 5.9@xmath22 & -0.77 @xmath20 0.09 & -0.14 @xmath20 0.08 & 18.6 & f09 + vucd3 & 12:30:57.40 & 12:25:44.8 & 710.6 @xmath20 3.5 & 15.0@xmath23 & 0.13 @xmath20 0.03 & 0.38 @xmath20 0.03 & 18.1 & e07 + vucd4 & 12:31:04.51 & 11:56:36.8 & 919.7 @xmath20 1.7 & 11.9@xmath24 & -1.24 @xmath20 0.05 & -0.00 @xmath20 0.12 & 18.6 & e07 + vucd5 & 12:31:11.90 & 12:41:01.20 & 1290 @xmath20 3 & 10.7@xmath25 & -0.40 @xmath20 0.03 & 0.31 @xmath20 0.02 & 18.5 & e07 + vucd6 & 12:31:28.41 & 12:25:03.30 & 2101 @xmath20 4 & 8.3@xmath26 & -1.03 @xmath20 0.12 & 0.41 @xmath20 0.09 & 18.7 & e07 + vucd7 & 12:31:52.93 & 12:15:59.50 & 985 @xmath20 5 & 10.7@xmath25 & -0.54 @xmath20 0.03 & 0.13 @xmath20 0.04 & 18.0 & e07 + vucd8 & 12:32:04.33 & 12:20:30.62 & 1531 @xmath20 19 & 11.6@xmath27 & -1.24 @xmath20 0.03 & -0.09 @xmath20 0.09 & 19.1 & f09 + vucd9 & 12:32:14.61 & 12:03:05.40 & 1325 @xmath20 5 & 11.6@xmath28 & -1.03 @xmath20 0.06 & 0.07 @xmath20 0.11 & 18.8 & f09 + vucd10 & 12:30:30.86 & 12:18:41.66 & 2425 @xmath20 103 & 9.8@xmath29 & -0.89 @xmath20 0.09 & 0.50 @xmath20 0.04 & 19.1 & new + /fe]-abundance versus local projected galaxy density are shown for de nuclei ( black ) and ucds ( green).,width=302 ]    in order to derive stellar population parameters from the measured line strengths , we translate our lick index measurements into ssp - equivalent ages , metallicities , and @xmath2-element abundance ratios by comparing them to the model of @xcite by @xmath30minimization , following @xcite . we use nine well - measured indices ( h@xmath31 , h@xmath32 , fe4383 , h@xmath33 , fe5015 , mgb , fe5270 , fe5335 & fe5406 ) in case of the de nuclei . for the ucds we use only h@xmath33 , mgb , fe5270 and fe5335 , because we only find these four indices available in the literature for those three ucds that we did not target ourselves . moreover , due to the slit mask placement , our observations only cover the full range of indices ( i.e. , @xmath174000  to @xmath175600 ) for three of the observed ucds . for completeness , we also checked whether the use of different sets of indices produces any significant discrepancy in the estimated ssp parameters . we find that the estimated ssp parameters agree well within the errors , although the use of a larger set of indices naturally leads to smaller errors in the ssp parameters . therefore , we keep using all nine indices for the de nuclei in the further analysis . /fe]-abundance versus nucleus / ucd magnitude , for de nuclei ( black ) and ucds ( green).,width=302 ]    the relation between the stellar population parameters and the local projected galaxy density is plotted in fig . the local projected density has been calculated from a circular projected area enclosing the 10th neighbor . it seems that there is a weak correlation between the local projected density and the ages of the nuclei . but , more prominent than the correlation , an age break is seen at a projected density @xmath3440 sq.deg.@xmath35 . we thus use this value to divide our de sample in two groups , located in cluster regions of lower / higher density . we find median ages of 2.6 gyr for the low density group and 11.6 gyr at high densities . almost all ucds lie in the high density region as defined above . their ages have a median of 11.7 gyr , strikingly consistent with the nuclei in the same density regime . as a statistical comparison , we performed a kolmogorov - smirov ( k - s ) test with the null hypothesis that there is no difference in the distribution of ssp parameters between the ucds and the de nuclei of the high density group . we find that there is a probability of 88% , 97% and 73% for having the same age , metallicity , and [ @xmath2/fe]-abundance distribution , respectively . the metallicities of de nuclei also show a difference between the low and high density regions : the median values differ by more than 0.5 dex , although the scatter is fairly large . the ucds also have a fairly large scatter in metallicity , ranging from + 0.1 to @xmath361.4 dex . however , it is remarkable that only two ucds ( vucd3 and 4 ) have a metallicity above @xmath360.5 dex . the [ @xmath2/fe]-abundances are more or less consistent with solar in case of the de nuclei , but also a slight increase with density can be recognized for the nuclei and ( more clearly ) for the ucds . although the scatter is fairly large , the spearman s rank correlation coefficients are 0.3 and 0.7 for de nuclei and ucds , with the probabilities for the null hypothesis that there is no correlation being 8.5% and 1.5% , respectively . in case of the ucds , 7 out 10 have super - solar values of [ @xmath2/fe ] . the relation between the stellar population parameters and the @xmath5-band magnitudes of ucds and nuclei is presented in fig . we do not see a relation of age and [ @xmath2/fe]-abundance with luminosity , both for nuclei and ucds . unlike that , the metallicity of both ucds and de nuclei tends to increase with increasing luminosity , following the well known metallicity - luminosity relation . however , bimodal peaks of the age and metallicity distributions of de nuclei can be seen as a striking feature in fig  [ env ] ( right panel ) . this indicates the inhomogeneous nature of de nuclei , which can be divided into two different groups of stellar population characteristics : a young metal - rich group and an old metal - poor group . brighter nuclei predominantly have metal - rich stellar populations consistent with solar values . the metal - poor nuclei ( metallicity @xmath37 - 0.5 dex ) have an average of @xmath361.0 dex , and most of them are less luminous than @xmath38 mag ( @xmath39 mag ) . we have derived stellar population parameters of virgo cluster ucds and nuclei of early - type dwarf galaxies , through fitting measured lick absorption line strengths to models of @xcite . since we use simple stellar population models , it must be noted that our estimated parameters are interpreted as _ ssp - equivalent . _    indications that the ucds in the virgo cluster more likely have formed via de destruction in dense cluster regions than in the fornax cluster have already been presented in the literature @xcite . an explanation could be the higher mass of the virgo cluster , which provides a deeper potential well with stronger tidal forces than in the fornax cluster . virgo ucds were also found to be significantly different from gcs in colors and sizes , as they are bluer and larger than gcs @xcite . e07 showed that virgo ucds have structural properties similar to the fornax ucds . furthermore , @xcite showed with the _ hst _ that fornax ucds are more extended and have higher surface brightnesses than typical dwarf nuclei . that is not necessarily inconsistent with the stripping scenarios , because the stripping process can alter structural parameters of the embedded nuclei . therefore , a direct comparison of structural parameters may not be able to constrain the formation scenarios of ucds properly .    in the light of our new age and metallicity estimates in the previous section , we want to address the possibility of formation of virgo ucds via tidal destruction of nucleated des . we observe that ucds exhibit significantly older and more metal deficient stellar populations as compared to de nuclei _ on average_. however , if we compare the ages of ucds and nuclei only in high density regions , where most of the ucds are located , we do not find any significant difference in their age and metallicity distribution . only two de nuclei ( vcc0965 and vcc1122 ) out of 13 from the high density group have ages less than 5 gyr and metallicities above -0.2 dex . note , however , that due to projection effects , a number of objects that are actually located in the outskirts of the cluster must fall into regions of high _ projected _ density , lying in front or behind the center along the line of sight . if we consider the low density group of our sample to be representative for nuclei of des outside of the ( threedimensional ) cluster center , then we actually _ expect _ to have a few objects with young ages and high metallicities in the high density group , consistent with what we observe . moreover , even without taking this effect into account , our statistical tests already show that the age distributions of ucds and de nuclei are similar when considering only the group of nuclei in the high density . this supports the idea of the threshing of des in high density environments to form the ucds .    at low densities , a certain fraction of des probably still retained some central gas and transformed it into stars ( some des are still doing this , see @xcite ) . consequently , their nuclei today would indeed show a younger stellar population than a ucd , the latter being an `` old nucleus '' . for such des , not only the orbital average should be located in the outskirts , but they should also not have passed right through the center ( e.g.  on an eccentric orbit ) , otherwise the gas would have been stripped by ram pressure and tidal forces . this would explain the fact that we do not see young ucds : a de destruction is only possible if the galaxy really goes through the center and experiences the strongest tidal forces . if we assume that the _ full _ destruction , i.e.  the complete removal of the de s main body , takes significantly more orbital time than the gas stripping , then nucleated des with an orbit leading through the center first lost their gas , halting any star formation , and then became destroyed . therefore , we have no young ucds . in any case , young and bright de nuclei have either late or prolonged star formation activity . we assess this by modeling spectra of composite stellar populations through superposition of a young and an old component , using the model spectra of @xcite . we fix the old population at an age of 11 gyr and a metallicity of -1.2 dex , and add a component with solar metallicity and exponentially declining star formation rate , starting from an age of 11 gyr . we find that spectra like those of the young nuclei ( with an ssp - equivalent age of @xmath173 gyr ) can be achieved when the exponentially declining component formed stars until 2 gyr ago , at which point it is truncated . this means , if we assume our model to represent the observed young nuclei , their star formation activity would have stopped 9 gyr later than that of the old nuclei . on the one hand , the estimated ages and metallicities of ucds nicely agree with the ages and metallicities of nuclei of des from the dense cluster regions . on the other hand , most of the old nuclei are fainter than the ucds . however , the ucd discoveries might suffer a selection effect : if a _ faint _ nucleus was stripped , it would now be automatically counted into the globular cluster system of m87 . we can hardly estimate how many nucleated des have already been destroyed and transformed into ucds during the lifetime of the cluster . thus we can not rule out or confirm any scenario _ just by counting _ the number of bright nuclei or that of ucds . only detailed future simulations can resolve this issue . t.l .  thanks anna pasquali and eva grebel for fruitful discussions concerning ucds , and katharina glatt for support with the 2007 observing run . the authors thank g.  hensler , s.  kim , r.  kotulla , h.  kuntschner , c.  mastropietro , s .- c . rey , and s.  weinmann for their valuable input to the 2009/10 observing proposal and the data analysis . and t.l .  are supported within the framework of the excellence initiative by the german research foundation ( dfg ) through the heidelberg graduate school of fundamental physics ( grant number gsc 129/1 ) . j.j . acknowledges support by the gottlieb daimler and karl benz foundation . this study is based on the sloan digital sky survey ( http://www.sdss.org ) .","The text discusses the discovery of ultra-compact dwarf galaxies (UCDs) in the Virgo cluster, which are compact and luminous objects that are similar to globular clusters but are much smaller and brighter.

**Key points:**

1. **Discovery of UCDs**: The authors","to address the question of whether the so - called ultra compact dwarf galaxies ( ucds ) are the remnant nuclei of destroyed early - type dwarf galaxies ( des ) , we analyze the stellar population parameters of the nuclei of 34 virgo des , as well as ten virgo ucds , including one that we discovered and which we report on here . 
 based on absorption line strength ( lick index ) measurements , we find that nuclei of virgo des have younger stellar population ages than ucds , with averages of 5 gyr and @xmath010 gyr , respectively . 
 in addition to this , the metallicity also differs : de nuclei are on average more metal - rich than ucds . on the other hand , comparing the stellar population parameters at the same local galaxy density , with ucds being located in the high density cluster regions , we do not find any difference in the stellar populations of de nuclei and ucds . in those regions , 
 the de nuclei are as old and as metal poor as ucds . 
 this evidence suggests that the virgo ucds may have formed through the stripping of de nuclei .",21860,448,1060,20.60 seconds,5.25 MB,0.319672131147541,0.08264462809917354,0.1721311475409836,0.8141862154006958,medium

accuracy over the most area of the complex plain , all of them have the same drawback ; their accuracy deteriorates with decreasing parameter @xmath20 ( in fact , the computation of the complex error function at small @xmath33 is commonly considered problematic for high - accuracy computation of the voigt / complex error function not only in the rational approximations @xcite ) . in this work we propose a new rational approximation of the dawson integral and show how its algorithmic implementation effectively resolves such a problem in computation of the complex error function at small @xmath33 . in our recent publication @xcite we have shown that a new methodology of the fourier transform results in a rational approximation @xmath34 where the corresponding expansion coefficients are given by @xmath35 @xmath36 @xmath37 and @xmath38 is the step . in algorithmic implementation it is convenient to rewrite the equation above in form @xmath39    using the residue calculus , from approximation we can obtain the rational approximation for the @xmath24-function ( see appendix b ) @xmath40.\ ] ] as @xmath41 $ ] from the identity it follows that @xmath42 = \frac{{\sqrt \pi   } } { 2}l\left ( x \right).\ ] ] consequently , according to this identity and equation we can write @xmath43.\ ] ] since the argument @xmath32 is real , it would be reasonable to assume that this equation remains valid for a complex argument @xmath3 as well if the condition @xmath33 is satisfied . therefore , substituting the rational approximation of the dawson integral into identity results in @xmath44 , \qquad     { \mathop{\rm im}\nolimits } \left [ z \right ] <   < 1 . \end{aligned}\ ] ]    the representation of the approximation can be significantly simplified as given by @xmath45 <   < 1 , \end{aligned}\ ] ] where the expansion coefficients are @xmath46 @xmath47 and @xmath48    as we can see from equation only the @xmath49-function needs a nested loop in multiple summation . therefore , most time required for computation of the complex error function is taken for determination of the @xmath49-function . however , this approximation is rapid due to its simple rational function representation . although the first term @xmath50 in approximation is an exponential function dependent upon the input parameter @xmath51 , it does not decelerate the computation since this term is not nested and calculated only once . consequently , the approximation is almost as fast as the rational approximation . the relatively large area at the origin of complex plane is the most difficult for computation with high - accuracy . according to karbach _ @xcite the newest version of the _ roofit _ package , written in c / c++ code , utilizes the equation ( 14 ) from the work @xcite in order to cover accurately this area , shaped as a square with side lengths equal to @xmath52 .        in the algorithm we have developed , instead of the square we apply a circle with radius @xmath53 centered at the origin . this circle separates the complex plane into the inner and outer parts . only three approximations can be applied to cover the entire complex plain with high - accuracy . the outer part of the circle is an external domain while the inner part of the circle is an internal domain consisting of the primary and secondary subdomains . these domains are schematically shown in fig . 1 . external domain is determined by boundary @xmath54 and represents the outer area of the circle as shown in fig . in order to cover this domain we apply the truncated laplace continued fraction @xcite @xmath55 that provides a rapid computation with high - accuracy . it should be noted , however , that the accuracy of the laplace continued fraction deteriorates as @xmath56 decreases . the inner part of the circle bounded by @xmath57 is divided into two subdomains . most area inside the circle is occupied by primary subdomain bounded by @xmath58 . for this domain we apply the rational approximation that approaches the limit of double precision when we take @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 ( see our recent publication @xcite for description in determination of the parameter @xmath38 ) . the secondary subdomain within the circle is bounded by narrow band @xmath1 ( see fig . 1 along @xmath32-axis ) . the rational approximation sustains high - accuracy within all domain @xmath62 required for applications using the hitran molecular spectroscopic database @xcite . however , at @xmath63 its accuracy deteriorates by roughly one order of the magnitude as @xmath20 decreases by factor of @xmath64 . the proposed approximation perfectly covers the range @xmath33 . in particular , at @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 this approximation also approaches the limit of double precision as the parameter @xmath20 tends to zero .    in order to quantify the accuracy of the algorithm we can use the relative errors defined for the real and imaginary parts as follows @xmath65 -

"many structures are able to change their mechanical properties and dimensions when an appropriate stimulus is applied . this phenomenon is commonly called actuation . the energy from an external source triggers changes in the internal state of the system , leading to a mechanical response much larger than the initial input . this ability to unlock internal work in a solid state structure is of key importance for many actuator applications . actuators with differing characteristics and mechanisms have been widely adopted by industry to fill a variety of technological requirements  @xcite with some having a one - way response , while others providing an equilibrium , reversible response to the given stimulus . shape - memory alloys  @xcite or polymers  @xcite are good examples of such smart actuating systems . however , in most cases a shape memory system works only in one direction , requiring a reset after the actuation . only very few systems can reversibly actuate and then return back to the equilibrium shape once the stimulus is removed . so far only liquid crystal elastomers  @xcite have proven to be a truly equilibrium reversible actuating system . a polymer benign to external stimulus can also be made to actuate when blended with of one or more distinctly different materials to impart a new physical response leading to the actuation process . a recent article has demonstrated one such system , based on a common silicon rubber filled with a low concentration of aligned carbon nanotubes , actuating in response to infrared radiation  @xcite . apart from actuation itself , the stimulation of functionalized nanotubes by infrared ( ir ) radiation is also proving an effective technique , e.g. in biomedical applications  @xcite . clearly , there are rich prospects and much motivation to understand nanotube action and the actuation behavior under ir irradiation when they are embedded in a polymer matrix . the work presented here focuses on the use of multi - walled carbon nanotubes ( mwcnts ) to impart equilibrium mechanical actuation in the rubbery matrix . the properties of multi - walled nanotubes has been well documented for over a decade  @xcite . their behavior in polymer composites is less well understood but some reviews have recently appeared in the literature  @xcite . for mechanical applications , the interface between the tube surface and the host polymer is of critical importance and most of the studies have focussed on this aspect . in contrast , the nature of the active response of nanotubes within a polymeric matrix has yet to be fully understood . the complex behavior of tubes is often simplified and analogies are made with aligned rigid rods . it is unclear whether such analogies are always valid , especially when the tubes do not necessarily form rigid rods in a polymer matrix and certainly do not align unless an external field is present  @xcite . the actuating properties of mwcnts have recently being elucidated upon with the possibility of designing nanoelectromechanical ( nems ) systems  @xcite . the actuator properties of individual bending mwcnts under an applied electric field have been studied experimentally  @xcite . the torsional actuation behavior of multi - walled tubes has also been reported  @xcite . these works are important but we note that all these studies focus on individual tubes and not a collection of tubes , nor their properties within a continuous elastic matrix . the massive elastic response of single - walled nanotube bundles , when stimulated by light , was very effectively demonstrated by zhang and iijima  @xcite , although little work has followed from their discovery . they showed the bundles responding to visible light and a near ir laser radiation by elastically changing their dimensions ; examining the figures in @xcite we deduce that the induced strain must be about 20% . in the context of this paper , we shall refer to the actuation stroke as the change in strain , when an external stimulus is applied . there are several reports of actuation behavior of polymer - nanotube composites  @xcite . these works have focussed on accentuating the already present features of the host matrix by adding nanotubes . the tubes act to exaggerate the response by either improving electromechanical properties or increasing heat transfer efficiency due to the inherent high conductivity   that originates from their delocalized @xmath0-bonded skeleton . recent work has departed from this traditional ` improvement ' scheme and asked whether it is possible to blend nanotubes with benign polymers to create new composite actuator properties , that otherwise would not occur in that system . such effects have been observed by courty  _ et al . _ @xcite where electric field stimulation of liquid crystal elastomers with embedded mwcnts lead to mechanical contraction . similarly , the photomechanical response from mwcnts when embedded in a silicone rubber ( pdms ) matrix  @xcite is a new effect . the pristine elastomer shows no response to near ir radiation , yet the presence of nanotubes causes a strong reversible response that can be tailored by manipulating the degree of alignment the tubes experience . the present work expands on such a simple polymer nanocomposite system and goes on to show that the effect can exist independently of the host polymer matrix which , by the presence of mwcnts , produces a mechanical response to the ir irradiation . we show that both a compression and an extension response can be achieved ( depending on the external uniaxial strain applied to the composite sample ) , but that the magnitude of the actuation stroke strongly depends on the host polymer used . we also develop a simple model that considers the orientational ordering of nanotubes in the matrix along with their individual and bulk actuating behavior . this paper is organized as following : after giving details of preparation and basic composite characterization , we concentrate on the analysis of tube orientation induced by stretching of the host polymer matrix , section iii . we then turn to the ir - stimulated actuation , section iv , and study different nanocomposite systems in some detail ( although the majority of our studies remain on the pdms system ) . section v presents a simple theoretical model that might well describe the actuation mechanism and compares it with our experimental data and the literature . we conclude that two - way actuation behavior is dependent on nanotube orientation , but is independent of the chosen homogenous polymer matrix and can occur in any rubbery solid , albeit with varying magnitude . it is thought that no other materials of any class ( metal , polymer , ceramic ) can display this behavior and to such large effect , thus , the study of the underlying physics of such systems is of clear scientific , medical and commercial importance . there are many different sources of carbon nanotubes on the market today . after extensive searching and testing , we have settled on nanotubes provided by nanostructured & amorphous materials , inc . these are multi - walled , with the core diameter between 5 - 10 nm , outer diameter of 60 - 100 nm and length between 5 - 15 microns . purity has been verified ( with sem ) as @xmath195% in raw form from the supplier , in agreement with specification . these nanotubes were not surface - modified at any time during processing and are used throughout this study for all polymers tested . chemical functionalization is necessary in many nanocomposite fields , but in our work it has been avoided to reduce the number of variables in the system . we share the views of other authors that chemical functionalization of the tube walls will degrade the properties of the tubes overall due to further introduction of sp@xmath2 hybridized carbon defects  @xcite . three types of polymer have been tested ; pdms rubber ( crosslinked polydimethylsiloxane ) , sis ( styrene - isoprene - styrene ) triblock thermoplastic elastomer and a nematic liquid crystal elastomer ( lce , in both mono and polydomain form ) . each type of polymer has a unique preparation method outlined in the following sections . where possible , similarities in processing have been kept . table  [ tablemats ] lists the composites made and their abbreviations . .list of host polymer materials , nanotube loading and the abbreviations of resulting composites . [ cols=""^,<,<"",options=""header "" , ]      the pdms ( sylgard 184@xmath3 ) silicone elastomer system was obtained from dow corning , usa , in the form of the main compound and the hydrosilane curing agent ( crosslinker ) . in pristine conditions , the mixing and crosslinking procedure gives a uniform solvent - free elastomer . we have verified ( with sem on cryo - microtomed and freeze - fractured surfaces ) that the resulting polymer network is pure crosslinked pdms with no filler particles , as sometimes is the case with supplied elastomer mixes . the nanotube - polymer composite was fabricated by first carefully weighing the desired quantity of nanotubes and the polymer compound . calculations of weight percentage take into account the weight of crosslinker , to be later used in the mixture . the highly viscous fluid was sheared using an ika labortechnik mixer for a minimum of 24 hours . the crosslinker was added to the mixture after 24 hours . the ratio of crosslinker to pdms was 1:10 , according to sylgard 184@xmath3 specification , ensuring negligible sol fraction after preparation of the pristine network . the sample was then further sheared for another 30 seconds before being placed in vacuum for 5 minutes to degas , at all times remaining at ambient temperature to ensure little crosslinking reaction takes place in this time . after removing the air cavities , that unavoidably form during shear mixing , the mixture was deposited in a specially designed reactor ( centrifuge compartment with ptfe film lining its inner wall ) and placed in a centrifuge at 5000rpm and 80@xmath4c . at this temperature the pdms crosslinking is much faster and the centrifugation achieves the uniform thickness and full homogenization of resulting rubber composite samples . the subsequent processing depends on the target sample properties . if we require a completely non - aligned nanotube dispersion , the sample remains in the reactor for 24 hours , resulting in a homogeneous elastomer composite . in some cases ( as will be clear from the text below ) we aim to produce a sample with nanotubes permanently pre - aligned . in this case the initial mix remains in the reactor , at 80@xmath4c , for 14 minutes ( calculated from separate measurements of crosslinking reaction rates ) . the partially crosslinked network was then removed from the reactor and aligned mechanically by applying uniaxial extension using specially designed clamps . removing the sample from the reactor after what is a relatively short period of time ensures that it is being mechanically aligned while still having over 50% of crosslinking to take place . finally , while still constrained in the clamps , the sample was placed in an oven at 70@xmath4c for a further 24 hours as it finished its crosslinking cycle under stress . as a result a homogeneous elastomer was prepared where the nanotubes had a preferred orientation induced by the processing technique and are also well dispersed in the matrix . the degree of nanotube alignment in each sample was quantified using x - ray techniques ( discussed below ) . there is a separate question of solvent and shearing conditions , and the time required for the full mwcnt dispersion ; systematic studies of nanotube dispersion and re - aggregation rates are to be published shortly . the quality of nanotube dispersion is monitored throughout the processing with the use , initially , of optical microscopes and later with a high - resolution scanning electron microscope ( hrsem , phillips xl 30 series ) as aggregate sizes reduce below optical resolution . we find that a shearing regime of high - viscosity mixture , lasting 24 hours , is suitable in removing nanotube aggregates . samples are identified by the wt% of mwcnts mixed with the pdms and the abbreviations assigned to them in table  [ tablemats ] . most experiments have been conducted on the 0 , 0.02 , 0.3 , 0.5 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 and 7wt% mwcnts in pdms elastomer films . a sample with 3wt% carbon black instead of nanotubes has also been made using the same procedure . there is a wealth of literature regarding liquid crystal elastomer ( lce ) preparation  @xcite . for our purposes , we have tested two specific types of lce : polydomain and monodomain , with uniaxially aligned nematic director . control samples containing no nanotubes were made , following the procedure introduced in  @xcite and widely used in the field since . the procedure of nanocomposite preparation was detailed in  @xcite . the polysiloxane backbone chains ( @xmath5 monomer units long ) had their si@xmath6h bonds reacted , using platinic acid catalyst , with the terminal vinyl groups of the mesogenic rod - like molecule @xmath7methoxyphenyl ) @xmath8buteneoxy benzoate ( mbb ) and the two - functional crosslinker @xmath9,@xmath7di-@xmath10undeceneoxy benzene ( 11ub ) , with the molar ratio 18:1 ( thus achieving the 9:1 ratio of substituted groups on each chain , or the effective 10% crosslinking density ) . the crosslinking was initiated by a combination of adding the catalyst and heating to 80@xmath11c in the already described centrifugation reaction chamber . the subsequent procedure of two - stage crosslinking , with intermediate stretching to induce director alignment , is similar to the procedure of pdms alignment above . polydomain control samples were made identically with the single exception that no uniaxial extension is applied during the crosslinking cycle . this avoids orientational bias being introduced during processing .    for lce nanocomposites , a minor modification is made . before the crosslinker and catalyst were added , mwcnts were shear mixed into the polymer to ensure homogenous dispersion . due to the sensitivity of the crosslinker and catalyst , shear mixing is reduced to 4 hours at elevated temperatures ( @xmath1250@xmath13 . this is acceptable as the nanotube concentration in such systems was very small ( 0.15 - 0.2wt% ) while the nematic polymer is highly viscous . a higher concentration in such a system is currently unachievable due to catalyst and crosslinker sensitivity limitations . the sis nanocomposite was made by adding the desired quantity of tubes ( 0.01wt% ) to the melt of sis symmetric triblock copolymer ( 14% of polystyrene , obtained from sigma aldrich ) in the presence of small amount of toluene solvent . the solvent dilutes the otherwise rubbery thermoplastic system and allows shear mixing at 40@xmath13 for 24 hours . the solvent was added in small portions during the mixing cycle to maintain the mixture in a high - viscosity state . once the dispersed state was achieved , fibers could be drawn from the mixture and left to air dry . during this period the ps micelles are formed in the usual way @xcite to form the elastic network surrounding and encapsulating the nanotubes . we note that too high a loading of mwcnt prevents physical crosslinks from occurring in the host polymer and thus nanotube content was kept to a very low level .    in all cases the sample dimensions were kept approximately constant , 1.5 mm @xmath14 3 cm , with thickness 0.2 mm .      the main part of this study , and purpose of this paper , is concerned with the response of these materials to infrared radiation and to that end a specially constructed rig was built to test the actuator response . two dynamometers were used in this study ; a 25 g dynamometer for small sensitive measurements and a larger 55 g dynamometer allowing a larger range of responses to be tested . the dynamometers ( pioden systems ltd ) were housed in a custom made thermal - control box with an open front end . the device , together with an independent thermocouple , outputs data via a daq card to a pc , see fig . [ appa ] . the sample ( s ) was clamped in the frame with its length controlled by the micrometer ( m ) , with @xmath150.001 mm accuracy , and the exerted force measured by the dynamometer ( d ) . thermocouples ( @xmath16 and @xmath17 ) were placed in front and behind , on the sample surface . the actuation was induced by the light source ( ir ) , schott kl1500 lcd , with quoted peak power density at @xmath18675 nm , 702 @xmath19w/@xmath20 at 1 m distance . the source uniformly illuminated the sample from @xmath21 cm distance . measuring the scaling of the intensity decay with distance , we obtained that the power density delivered to the sample was @xmath22 at 675 nm . the rig was enclosed in the thermally controlled compartment , and calibrated with weights to give a direct measure of stress and strain . figure  [ absorbance ] shows the spectral distribution of the light source , as well as the nanotube absorbance . these measurements were carried out on a varian cary 300 bio uv - visible spectrophotometer in the 190 - 1000 nm range , adjusted for the background . absorbtion units au@xmath23 $ ] indicate that the pdms control sample of given thickness transmits @xmath24% of light across the spectrum . in contrast , the same thickness of low - loading pdms0.3 composite absorbs @xmath25% of light across a range of wavelengths . the strong absorbtion of light by nanotubes is a well - known effect , although the relatively flat spectral distribution was a surprise in our case , fig . [ absorbance ] .    to standardize the results across all samples , pre - experimental checks were undertaken to accurately find the zero strain value of each experiment . the gradient of the stress - strain curve for a buckled sample was equated with the gradient for the stress - strain curve of the taut sample  the meeting point of the two lines designates the zero - point strain , with the length of sample defined as @xmath26 . the imposed extensional strain is calculated by @xmath27 , with @xmath28 provided from the micrometer reading . after a fixed pre - strain was applied to each sample , the stress was allowed to relax for a minimum of 10 minutes . after this relaxation period , readings of stress were taken for 1 - 2 minutes , to verify that the material is equilibrated , and then the ir source was switched on to full intensity . after a period of exposure , the light source was switched off and further relaxation data collected . after completion , the sample was relaxed and then this protocol was repeated for a different applied pre - strain @xmath29 . each sample is tested under a range of applied pre - strains between 2% and 40% ( @xmath30 . in order to avoid a systematic influence of pre - strain , through thermal history and possible degradation , we applied the different values of @xmath29 in random order , not sequentially . the lce composites have been tested for even larger deformation as they can spontaneously undergo thermal strains of hundreds of percent  @xcite . our attempts to rationalize the observed response , changing qualitatively on increasing the applied pre - strain , invoke the concept of increasing nanotube alignment under uniaxial deformation . to monitor this , wide angle x - ray diffraction measurements were carried out on a phillips pw1830 wide angle x - ray generator ( waxs ) using cu@xmath31 radiation ( 1.54@xmath32 ) , running at 40kv and 40ma . a specially designed clamp was used allowing measurement of the x - ray images as a function of the applied strain during the experiment . azimuthal scans of intensity were generated , fig . [ xray ] , and fitted with theoretical models . the method of background correction employed is crucial . two to three different regions were selected from an image to gather an average of background noise which is then subtracted from the azimuthal curves generated . this is repeated for all scattering images before order parameter was calculated .    with the ir irradiation , the question always exists , whether the response is due to photon absorption , or the trivial heating of the materials ( which does take place during irradiation ) . the technique used to measure temperature involves two thermocouples and we were reasonably sure that the measured increase in temperature ( @xmath1215 - 20@xmath33c ) is a true temperature across the sample . a separate study was conducted using thermocouples on the surface and embedded within the sample which showed similar values throughout for any relevant time - scale . the samples were kept purposely thin to ensure very quick heat conduction . to compare the effects , the same experiment was carried out on the pdms1 sample , with the infrared source replaced by a mica - insulated heater ( minco products inc . ) mounted approximately 10 mm away from the sample . temperature was regulated through an integrating controller using thermocouples mounted on the sample . the maximum temperature reached was 15 - 20@xmath34 above ambient , and although thermo - mechanical response was present , it was much slower and almost an order of magnitude smaller than the direct ir - irradiation effect . figure  [ modu ] shows a summary of the linear mechanical response of our nanocomposites for different nanotube loadings in the crosslinked pdms matrix . as the concentration of mwcnts is increased the rubbery network becomes stiffer and young modulus @xmath35 ( the response to static linear extension ) of the composites increases . this is expected and in line with literature findings  @xcite . an account for subtle variations in measured moduli could be obtained from the analysis of the polymer - nanotube interface and relaxation of local stress in the composites . this is not the focus of the work presented here .    at very low nanotube loading one might expect that large regions of rubbery network are still pristine . however , even with the lowest nanotube loading ( @xmath120.02wt% ) , a small but significant increase in modulus was observed suggesting that the presence of the tubes even in tiny quantities has an immediate mechanical effect . starting from @xmath120.02wt% the linear increase of the modulus was observed , characteristic of non - interacting inclusions in the elastic matrix . we observe an almost three - fold linear increase in the elastic modulus from 0 - 7wt% . it can be argued that at higher loading the concentration dependence must become non - linear , quadratic at first indicating the pair interactions between nanotube inclusions , etc . this may signify the onset of a ` mechanical ' percolation within the composite system . one may be tempted to make a connection between the onset of this non - linear regime and the separately determined electric percolation threshold , when the composite becomes conducting through nanotube contacts . unfortunately , it is difficult to make an unambiguous connection in a crosslinked system : an increase in tube concentration would undoubtedly increase the modulus @xmath35  but would also cause a reduction in the crosslinker concentration ( the presence of nanotubes has an inhibitive effect on siloxane reactions ) . overall , the young s modulus of such a nanocomposite would not be able to directly reflect the nanotube interactions .    for completeness , let us quote the measured young modulus values for the other nanocomposite systems under study mlce0.2 : @xmath36  mpa , plce0.15 : @xmath36  mpa , sis0.01 : @xmath37  mpa .        as a crucial part of material characterization , before and during the main actuation experiment , we need a more quantitative analysis of the nanotube orientation in the matrix . it is a key element in our model of the actuation mechanism , but also has its own merit considering the high interest in all aspects of polymer nanocomposite studies . wide angle x - ray diffraction is used as a method to determine the average tube orientation as a function of increasing applied uniaxial strain . figure  [ xray](a ) shows characteristic features of the diffraction image . the image is for pdms7 , initially non - aligned , stretched by @xmath38 ( 33% ) . the scattering reflection at an angle corresponding to mwcnt [ 002 ] layer periodicity ( inter - shell spacing  @xcite ) of 3.4@xmath39 allows calculation of the tube orientation distribution from the corresponding azimuthal intensity variation , fig . [ xray](b ) .    in this separate study of deformation - induced alignment we used a 7wt% loaded pdms7 composite simply to enhance the x - ray contrast and enable using a desktop x - ray generator ( as opposed to the synchrotron study required for very low - loading composites ) . note that the scattering intensity at 3.4@xmath39 is still relatively low , because of the small contrast between the nanotubes and pdms matrix . a question must arise about the bright scattering ring corresponding to the length scale @xmath40 . this is a very interesting feature , but totally irrelevant for our work : this scattering is exactly the same in the pristine pdms rubber prepared in the same batch . in the pdms network , with no solvent , the only x - ray contrast may arise due to the difference between the chains and crosslinks . a very clear scattering length must be an indication of crosslink density fluctuations ( in other terminology called clustering ) . as the extensive theory of this clustering phenomenon suggests  @xcite , at the given chain lengths and crosslinking density the network is well below the ` crosslink saturation threshold ' and the correlation length of clustering should be of the order of network mesh size . the length scale of @xmath40 is very accurately this size and , accordingly , we believe this scattering to be produced by very small scale crosslink density fluctuations . these should not affect macroscopic properties , or even the local mwcnt embedding . intensity variation along the azimuthal arcs , @xmath41 in fig . [ xray](b ) , is the signature of the orientational distribution function . when @xmath41 is approximated as a legendre polynomial series in @xmath42 , it gives a measure of the orientational order parameter s@xmath43 : @xmath44 where the averaging is performed with @xmath41 as the distribution function . this is called the herman s orientation parameter and it adequately describes the true orientational ordering at very small bias , when @xmath45 .    at higher degree of alignment ( such as , for instance , in nematic liquid crystals ) the orientational distribution function significantly deviates from the measured @xmath41 . the analytic treatment of the problem of x - ray scattering from orientationally biased medium is developed by deutsch  @xcite , mainly in the context of nematic liquid crystals . instead of using the full theory , we have derived an interpolating analytical approximation to the complete results of  @xcite . with that , the orientational order parameter is given by @xmath46 \bigg\ } d\beta \nonumber   \end{aligned}\ ] ] @xmath47 this expression also properly accounts for nontrivial geometric factors involved in projecting the 3d orientational distribution onto a 2d detector plane . experimental data was analyzed using both herman s approximation and deutsch s interpolated analytic result . we conclude that in the range of parameters we are working with both expressions were in agreement qualitatively but slightly differ quantitatively . we favor the deutsch analytical method and used it exclusively in this study . figure  [ order ] presents the results of the calculation of orientational order parameter @xmath48 , acquired as a function of sample strain applied to the pdms7 sample , as well as the prediction of the theoretical model discussed below . as the applied strain is increased , the initially disordered nanotubes align along the strain axis resulting in bias in the azimuthal curve @xmath41 this phenomenon has recently been confirmed by synchrotron experiments  @xcite although it should be noted that the focus of the work by kelarakis _ et al . _ was not on nanotube reorientation in a rubbery matrix . our composites , with no significant initial alignment , on subsequent stretching reached substantial values of induced orientational order . furthermore , the change in orientation on stretching was reversible , i.e. equilibrium , which is discussed later . to our knowledge , this is the first time nanotube _ reorientation _ has been reported and analyzed in a semisolid / rubbery sample .    as will be described in section  [ ir - sec ] , there is good evidence that much better nanotube alignment can be achieved if dispersed in a monodomain liquid crystal elastomer during processing  the mesogenic moieties act to align the tubes . a similar effect has been demonstrated for pure liquid crystals  @xcite , and also is well - known in the field of ferronematics  @xcite . x - ray diffraction of such a system is not reported due to the continuing problem of poor contrast between the two species and only low nanotube concentrations studied .    there is an issue , well argued in the literature  @xcite , about whether a truly isotropic nanotube dispersion can be obtained . regarding the tubes as rigid rods with extremely high aspect ratio , well dispersed in an amorphous medium , the onsager transition to the steric orientational ordering could start at very low concentrations as has been recently reported  @xcite . we have as yet observed no clear indication of truly nematic liquid crystalline architecture in our system , although this could be due to a number of factors including matrix viscosity and sample preparation . let us compare the observed induced orientational order parameter @xmath49 with a simple model prediction based on the affine deformation of the rubbery matrix . the most straightforward approach is to evaluate the average orientational bias resulting from an imposed uniaxial extension of such a matrix , in which the ensemble of rigid rods is initially embedded isotropically . the direction , known as the director @xmath50 , is the average axis along which nanotubes can and do align . this is a local property of the system obtained as a result of averaging of individual particle axes , @xmath51 , over the macroscopically infinitesimal volume . this averaging applies equally well for rigid rod - like particles and for the segments of semi - flexible chains , e.g. in the study of nematic polymers @xcite . the corresponding local orientational order parameter is a second - rank tensor @xmath52 which for the uniaxial alignment ( reflecting the quadrupolar symmetry breaking ) is defined as : @xmath53 where the principal axes are aligned with @xmath54 along the uniform ordering direction @xmath50 , cf . the value of the local scalar order parameter is indeed the average of the second legendre polynomial of orientation of embedded rods , @xmath55 \ , p(\theta ) \ , \sin\theta d\theta d\varphi . \label{defq}\ ] ] here @xmath56 for each rod , and @xmath57 is the orientational probability distribution , normalized such that @xmath58 . let us assume the initial state is un - aligned , and thus characterized by the flat distribution @xmath59 . the uniaxial extension of an incompressible elastic body is described by the matrix of strain tensor @xmath60 where the axis of stretching is taken as @xmath54 and the magnitude of stretching is @xmath61 is the ratio of the stretched and the initial sample length along @xmath54 , fig . this tensor describes the affine change of shape , which could also be visualized as locally transforming an embedded sphere ( representing the orientational distribution @xmath62 ) into the ellipsoid ( representing the induced orientational bias ) of the same volume and the aspect ratio @xmath63 . after such a deformation , every element of length in the body changes affinely according to the matrix product @xmath64 , which in our case of uniaxial incompressible extension means that @xmath65 and @xmath66 . this corresponds to the new angle of the rod , @xmath67 such that @xmath68 . therefore , to obtain the new ( now biased ) orientational distribution function we need to convert the variable @xmath69 into the new ( current ) variable @xmath67 , which gives ( after some algebraic manipulation ) @xmath70 this defines the expression for the normalized orientational distribution function @xmath71 which is an explicit function of the uniaxial strain applied to the body and can be used to calculate the induced order parameter @xmath72 : @xmath73 ^ 3 \sin \theta ' d\theta'd\varphi}{4\pi ( \cos^2 \theta ' + [ 1+\varepsilon]^3 \sin^2 \theta')^{3/2 } } - \frac{1}{2}. \label{orderaffine}\ ] ] analytical integration of this expression gives a function @xmath49 , which is plotted as a solid line in fig . [ order ] : @xmath74 @xmath75.$ ]    at relatively small strains , it approaches the linear regime : @xmath76 . the experimental data displays a lower order parameter than that predicted by the affine model , although has the same qualitative trend . one must remember that the model presented here does not account for tube flexibility . also , some proportion of the tubes would be unable to orientate affinely due to the entanglements . the experimental data reflects this and , accordingly , gives slightly lower values of order parameter . the detailed response to infrared stimuli is presented in figs .  [ steps ] , showing the stress measured in the pdms1 sample . results for all composites are qualitatively similar . we shall later examine the dependence on the host polymer and the tube concentration . composites , initially un - aligned , are subjected to an increasing extension that we call pre - strain @xmath29 . at each @xmath29 , the ir - irradiation takes place and the stress response recorded . the complexity of the plots necessitates more detailed description of what takes place . we begin with a 2% pre - strain ( @xmath77 ) applied to it initially . at @xmath78mins the light source is switched on and the stress reading changes downwards , meaning that the sample natural length @xmath26 has expanded on actuation ( recall that the actual length @xmath28 is fixed through @xmath79 ) . after a period of constant irradiation , at @xmath80mins , the light source is switched off  and the stress reading returns to its original value . this experiment is then repeated with the same sample pre - strained at different values , up to 40% , as shown by the sequence of stress - reading curves in fig . [ steps ] .    the data in fig . [ speed ] is assembled to demonstrate the speed of the actuation process more clearly , while fig . [ steps2wt ] helps differentiate between the light- and heat - driven actuation response . in this case the data is for a pdms3 composite ; as was mentioned above , all materials exhibit the same qualitative features . we plot the change in stress and change in temperature , normalized by their maximal value at saturation in the given experiment ; plotted in this form , all the results ( for different tube loading and different pre - strain ) appear universal . the change in temperature by ir - heating is unavoidable and reaches @xmath81c maximally on the sample surface , in our setting ( thermocouples placed below the surface and embedded in the center of the sample may report the temperature change of up to @xmath82c depending on nanotube concentration , but we avoided disturbing the sample in mechanical experiments ) . this highlights an important question as to whether the mechanical response is due to the photon absorption or plain heat . figure  [ steps2wt ] shows that the stress reaches its peak and saturation in @xmath83min , while the thermal takes over 2min to reach its peak . although the difference in rates is not very dramatic , the fact that the stress response is faster suggests that its mechanism is not caused by the trivial sample heating . in a separate study ( not shown ) we reach the conclusion that thermo - mechanical effects do exist ( i.e. the mwcnt - loaded composite has a stronger mechanical response to heating than a pristine polymer ) but their magnitude is almost an order of magnitude smaller than the direct ir - photon absorption mechanism .      of great interest is the observation that this response changes sign at a certain level of pre - strain ( at @xmath84 in fig .  [ steps ] ) . in other words , relaxed or weakly stretched composites show the reversible _ expansion _ on irradiation , while the same sample , once strained more significantly , demonstrates an increasing tendency to _ contract _ ( hence the increase in the measured stress ) . this is our key finding . figure  [ sum ] summarizes the magnitude of the ir - actuation effect by plotting the stress step at saturation ( @xmath85 ) in the ir - on state , at different levels of pre - strain and for samples with increasing mwcnt loading . although this is not explicitly measured in our ( isostrain , @xmath86const ) experiment , we can directly calculate the change of the underlying natural length @xmath26(ir ) of the samples on actuation from the known young modulus values . this is shown on the right axis of the same plot , highlighting the regions of expansion and contraction . remarkably , all samples with different nanotube loading appear to have a crossover at the same point , around 10% pre - strain .    for comparison , the pristine pdms rubber in the same experiment , shows no discernible stress response at all . also , the response of the pdms composite with a 3wt% of carbon black is much lower . indeed , this 3wt% carbon - black composite closely follows the low - concentration pdms0.02 composite . we believe the response is due to trace amounts of nanotubes that can often be found in commercially supplied carbon black . hence the very small response from such a highly loaded sample . the shift in transition pre - strain may well be due to the trace nanotubes having their alignment hindered by the activated carbon black . the interaction between filler particles is also evident when the nanotube concentration is increased beyond 2wt% loading . above this value , the magnitude of the actuation stroke decreases sharply . figure  [ interplay ] displays the effect clearly by plotting the maximal change in natural length @xmath26 on ir irradiation , at a fixed @xmath87 , for all pdms - nanotube composites , and the 3wt% carbon black system for comparison . a rapid increase in the stroke is observed with increasing concentration , which then peaks at 2wt% nanotube loading . the reason for the subsequent decline is not obvious . there may well be a number of factors that interplay to reduce the stroke magnitude . at high concentrations entanglements between the long tubes could take place . note that through conservation of volume , a contraction in the @xmath54-axis of the tube will be concomitant with an expansion in the @xmath88-@xmath89 plane ; such expansion may be hindered for a significant number of nanotubes by their nearest neighbors ( another representation of entanglement ) . there may also be an issue of photon screening at higher concentration which is difficult to avoid .      other polymers acting as a crosslinked host matrix for the low - concentration nanocomposite display the same qualitative behavior as pdms systems . figure  [ polydomaincnt ] summarizes the response of lce and sis composites . the direction of the actuation , changing from expansive to contractive mode with increasing mwcnt alignment , as observed in pdms - nanotube samples , is unambiguously reproduced for vastly different materials .    the magnitude of the actuation stroke is shown in fig .  [ polydomaincnt ] , in comparison with some of the pdms composites . the value of actuation stress is different for various polymeric systems considered in this work , which is due to the different young modulus ( which we use to calculate the stroke from the measured stress @xmath90 ) . we see that the stroke magnitude in these differing materials is in the same range of magnitudes . sis0.01 has a much lower filler concentration , and again its stroke is comparable to that of a similarly loaded pdms0.02 . this important finding demonstrates the universality of multi - walled nanotubes behaving as photo - actuators regardless of the soft matrix they are in . the response of nematic liquid crystal elastomers to heat is well documented  @xcite . because they can be thermo - responsive materials , the data in fig . [ polydomaincnt ] is obtained by a complex procedure of subtraction of such background effects . we do not go into its details , as this is irrelevant to the main points of the present paper , however , must emphasize that the plotted response highlights the effect of nanotubes within the given matrix .    in fig . [ polydomaincnt ] we note that the mlce0.2 sample shows no expansive actuation and a crossover , while the similar polydomain ( un - aligned ) composite does . this is clearly because the two - step crosslinking at preparation of the monodomain material involves aligning the mesogenic groups  @xcite . the embedded nanotubes align strongly under such conditions , as others have found in ordinary liquid nematics  @xcite . as already discussed , the expansive mode of actuation will only occur when the degree of nanotube alignment is very low . it is important that the crossover occurs at @xmath91% for all studied materials with nanotubes not aligned before pre - strain . there are two main questions to answer : what mechanism is responsible for such a large photo - mechanical response , and why does it reverse its direction on sample extension ?    we shall try to deduce the actuation behavior of individual tubes from the macroscopic observations detailed above . we believe the change of actuation direction on increasing sample extension is due to the nanotube alignment induced by pre - strain , as described in section  [ xraydata ] and before . in the whole region of our pre - strains , the orientational order induced in the mwcnt distribution is , to a good approximation , a linear function of the strain : @xmath92 in the affine model . at the crossover strain @xmath93 , the value of the order parameter would be @xmath94 . we now apply the same ideas about the induced orientational bias and averaging of the ( hypothetical ) individual nanotube response . let us assume this individual nanotube response to the ir photon absorbtion is , in essence , a contraction  because this is what our data shows the better - aligned composite response to be . it is easy to imagine why this could be for an initially rod - like tube : on photon absorption it could generate instabilities in the form of kinks , thus decreasing the net length due to the charge carrier separation . the resulting elastic deformation would be most pronounced in the already defect - dominated regions of the nanotube . such an explanation , based on concentration of induced polarons  @xcite , would also link with the earlier observation of a similar actuation response under dc electric field  @xcite . an alternative possibility is to suggest that large ( and fast ) local tube heating  @xcite causes the surrounding region of locally aligned elastomer to contract and `` crush '' the nanotube . this version of microscopic events does not contradict the discussion and the data in fig . [ steps2wt ] , which shows the ( slow ) global thermal effect .    at this stage we have to leave open the question of individual tube response to near ir radiation . using an affine approach similar to the earlier analysis of ordering , let us assume that each nanotube undergoes a linear contraction by a factor @xmath95 ( certainly proportional to radiation intensity , which was kept constant in our work but has previously been shown to effect the elastic response  @xcite ) . this contraction must be accompanied by a transversely - isotropic volume conserving expansion @xmath96 . this means that a local strain is created with the principal axes along the nanotube orientation ( at angle @xmath69 to the macroscopic @xmath54-axis , see fig . [ affi ] )    @xmath97 the projection of this local strain on the macroscopic axis of sample extension ( and force measurement ) is @xmath98 averaging the local contribution with the probability to find the nanotube at this orientation , @xmath99 obtained in section  [ xraydata ] , gives an estimate of the effective stroke of the actuation . when multiplied by the corresponding young modulus , the exerted stress of fig . [ sum ] is also obtained : @xmath100 at small deformations . such a model is very crude indeed , ignoring a large number of undoubtedly important and delicate factors of continuum elasticity and nanotube response . however , it is elastically self - consistent and has only one parameter , @xmath101 that presumably carries all the underlying complexity of the problem in it . the orientational averaging is given by using the distribution @xmath99 with the projection of local strain in eq . ( [ lz ] ) : @xmath102 p(\theta ) \ , \sin\theta d\theta d\varphi \nonumber \\ & \approx &   { \textstyle{\frac{1}{3 } } } \left(\delta + 2/\sqrt{\delta } \right ) -{\textstyle{\frac{2}{5 } } } \varepsilon \left ( 1/\sqrt{\delta } - \delta \right ) \label{avl}\end{aligned}\ ] ]    although the integral above has a full analytic form , it is more transparent to present its expansion to the linear order of small imposed pre - strain @xmath29 as shown in the second line of eq.([avl ] ) . this demonstrates the key point : at very low pre - strain , @xmath103 , the average uniaxial deformation of the disordered nanocomposite is positive @xmath104 , i.e. the expansion of its natural length . however , above a threshold pre - strain @xmath105 this average deformations transforms into the sample contraction along @xmath54 . it is easy to find the crossover , @xmath106 so that the prediction would be to observe the crossover at @xmath107 if the nanotube response factor @xmath108 . that is , on ir - irradiation the nanotube contracts overall by @xmath1220% . the value is higher than one might expect , considering early reports in the literature of nanotube strains of only 1 - 2% . however , as fig . [ affi ] indicates , our proposition is not that of the lattice strain of nanotube walls but a contortion of the tube as a whole . although this has not been yet directly observed and reported in the literature , a similar effect of resonant undulation has been seen ( in simulation  @xcite and in experiment  @xcite ) in response to distortion beyond the linear regime . furthermore , the more recent theoretical work on single - walled tubes supports the idea that massive @xmath109axis contraction . although in our system the multi - walled tubes respond under different conditions , being embedded in an elastic matrix under strain and absorbing the ir photons , the overall distortion factor of 20% suggested by the model fit is perhaps not altogether unreasonable . figure  [ theo ] plots the full ( non - expanded ) result of orientational averaging of actuation stroke @xmath110 from the integral in eq.([avl ] ) to illustrate the points discussed in this section . the qualitative behavior ( as summarized in fig .  [ sum ] ) is reproduced here almost exactly , including the magnitude of the predicted actuation stroke [ that is , the ratio @xmath111 . note that we use only one parameter , @xmath101 to match both the crossover @xmath105 and the actuation stroke magnitude , so the conclusion is quite satisfactory and agrees with an apparent universality discussed in section  [ hosts ] . it is very likely that the orientational feature of the effect , with its change of actuation direction at a critical level of induced alignment , @xmath112 , is captioned correctly , while much more work is required to understand the individual nanotube response to ir radiation generating the phenomenological factor @xmath101 used in this analysis . to summarize , this work describes the rich photo - actuation phenomena of carbon nanotubes embedded in crosslinked rubbery matrices . the composite materials show the ability to change their actuation direction , from expansive to contractive response , as greater imposed strain is applied to the sample . we use differing host polymers and confirm their relatively neutral role in the actuation mechanism . theoretical models have been put forward to describe the orientational order imposed on the nanotubes by a uniaxial strain and the resulting actuation . treating the nanotubes as rigid rods that rotate affinely in a deforming matrix is a very simplistic view , but it gives predictions that agree with experiment qualitatively and often quantitatively . we believe that the ( certainly wrong ) idea of the whole tube acting as a rigid rod is not actually necessary  in effect , in our model , the `` rigid rods '' are nanotube segments below persistence length . in that case , as in main - chain semiflexible nematic polymers , the model is non - controversial and the agreement with experiment not coincidental . the tube orientational distribution appears to account well for the key macroscopic features of the observed photo - actuation . the strength of photo - mechanical response , at a given radiation intensity , is of the order of tens of kpa . translated into the stroke , this corresponds to actuation strains of + 2 ( expansion ) to -10% ( contraction ) depending on the nanotube concentration , alignment ( controlled by pre - applied strain ) and the host matrix . as expected , the response increases at higher nanotube loading however , only up to a limit . beyond this limit ( @xmath113 in pdms ) , the macroscopic actuation is inhibited by inter - tube interactions and possible charge accumulation . the similar ( thermal actuation ) behavior is also observed when the samples are heated by the same amount , but this has a much lower amplitude . understanding the nature of the actuator mechanisms in this system certainly warrants further theoretical and experimental investigation . many questions remain completely unclear , in particular , what the effect would be if different types of nanotube were used i.e. smaller multi - wall diameters , single - wall tubes , various chirality etc . with actuating materials already used in such widespread applications , from micromanipulators to vibration control , the discovery of a structure that can respond to stimulus in both directions may open new possibilities and could mean an important new step toward finding applications for nanotube based materials above and beyond improvements in existing carbon fibre technologies . we thank h. krner , r. vaia , a. craig and p. cicuta for useful discussions , and k. channon for help with nanotube absorbance data . this work was carried out with the support of the engineering and physical sciences research council and a case award from makevale ltd .","The text discusses the actuation behavior of carbon nanotube (CNT) composites in response to infrared (IR) radiation.

**Key points:**

1. **Actuation mechanism:** The actuation is caused by the alignment of nanotubes in the host polymer matrix, leading to a reversible change in the material's mechanical properties","rubber composites containing multi - walled carbon nanotubes have been irradiated with near infrared light to study their reversible photo - mechanical actuation response . 
 we demonstrate that the actuation is reproducible across differing polymer systems . 
 the response is directly related to the degree of uniaxial alignment of the nanotubes in the matrix , contracting the samples along the alignment axis . 
 the actuation stroke depends on the specific polymer being tested , however , the general response is universal for all composites tested .

"in ref .  @xcite we have shown through the example of the extraction of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) angle @xmath0 from @xmath1 decays that the bayesian treatment as done , e.g. , by the utfit collaboration  @xcite , suffers from major difficulties . the problems we have found are related to the presence of unknown free parameters which should actually be constrained by the data . we have shown that the results of the bayesian analysis depend on the priors and the chosen parameterization in an uncontrollable manner , and may even diverge in some cases . furthermore we have demonstrated that the priors can not always be specified in a consistent way with respect to the symmetries of the problem , which results in the present example in an incorrect description of the @xmath2 limit . the authors of ref . @xcite replied to our criticism . in the first part of their paper they agree with us on the dependence of the analysis with respect to the choice of priors and parameterization , even when the data are sufficiently precise so that the posterior pdfs are contained in the corresponding prior ranges . @xcite claims that this should not be viewed as a fundamental drawback of the bayesian treatment , because in the absence of additional information on the parameters one should use uniform priors on the quantities that are directly measured ( what we have called the `` explicit solution '' parameterization in  @xcite ) . we emphasize in the following that this recipe can only be ( approximately ) justified within the framework of classical statistics and is thus not actually bayesian . moreover , it is far from being general .    in the second part of ref .  @xcite it is argued that in addition to the isospin analysis one may use bounds on the magnitude of the fit parameters related to hadronic matrix elements , and when taken into account the bayesian treatment behaves more reliably . while this new recommendation may appear physically sound , the problem reported in  @xcite uses the original isospin analysis  @xcite , where the hadronic parameters are unknown and only isospin symmetry is used . changing the hypotheses can not be considered as a satisfying answer to our findings : indeed the validity of the statistical approach must be proven independently of the problem at hand . despite this inconsistency , we accept the new proposal and show below that even with the use of this additional information one finds important quantitative and qualitative differences between the frequentist and the bayesian results .    in any case , the new recommendations of the utfit collaboration for treating problems with _ a priori _ free unknown parameters differ quite importantly from their previous publications , which implies that the results published therein are obsolete . we are therefore expecting new analysis results for the angles @xmath0 from @xmath3 and @xmath4 from charmful modes , for which similar difficulties can be apprehended . we conclude that ref . @xcite does not abrogate our criticism , because the only known examples where the bayesian treatment leads to a numerically reasonable result do not provide any general argument in favor of the underlying hypotheses . in contrast , the frequentist approach can handle many types of situations smoothly , independently of whether there are free parameters and/or theoretical uncertainties . the term `` isospin analysis '' ( which in ref . @xcite is replaced by `` minimal assumptions '' ) refers to the original paper by gronau and london  @xcite . within this framework , only isospin symmetry is used to parametrize the decay amplitudes . although it is not an exact symmetry , its accuracy in @xmath5 is expected to be of the order of 1%  @xcite ( once the known dominant contribution from electroweak penguins has been taken into account ) and is thus of phenomenological relevance . neither the standard model nor isospin symmetry imply anything on the `` natural '' scale of the hadronic amplitudes .    in ref . @xcite we showed that the pivk - le diberder ( pld ) and explicit solution ( es ) parameterizations give the most reasonable answer for the bayesian treatment , because the corresponding parameters are close or identical to the measured quantities . this is confirmed ( for the es parameterization ) by the authors of ref . @xcite , who thus agree on the fact that other parameterizations lead to unstable results . the better behavior of the es description ( which follows from our detailed analysis and should be acknowledged as such ) can be easily understood as follows . let us stick to the gaussian case and first assume that there is no degeneracy so that the angle @xmath0 is given by a known single - valued function of the observables . one can construct a sampling distribution for @xmath0 as defined by its analytical expression by randomizing the observables according to gaussian pdfs where the true ( unknown ) central values and standard deviations have been replaced by their corresponding measured estimators . it is then straightforward to show that the position of the peak and its width are _ consistent estimators _ of , respectively , @xmath0 and its uncertainty . this procedure does not need to define priors nor integration on the true values of the parameters , and does not rely on bayes theorem : it just follows from standard rules of classical statistics . technically this procedure can be reproduced by applying the `` bayesian '' treatment of ref . @xcite to the es parameterization  @xcite with uniform priors . because for gaussian measurements the standard deviation of a quantity is equal to the 68% cl frequentist error , it is not a surprise to have similar numbers in the es parameterization between the `` bayesian '' and frequentist treatments . the remaining differences , namely the fact that one finds exactly degenerate mirror solutions only in the frequentist approach , mainly come from the integration ( logical and ) over mirror solutions in the randomization treatment , which results from an unacceptable interpretation of physical constants that could simultaneously take different values  @xcite .    besides , the explicit solution trick is not general enough to treat with `` minimal assumptions '' all the interesting physical problems . even when there is the same number of parameters as the number of independent observables , there is no guarantee that the theoretical equations can be inverted to express the parameters as functions of the observables . the gronau - london isospin analysis is quite special in this respect . more importantly , most of the time one has overconstrained systems , that is one has more observables than parameters . in this case no `` explicit solution '' parameterization exists , and no general probability argument would help to find what is the most `` natural '' parameterization for a bayesian treatment with uniform priors .    to close this section we point out two misconceptions in ref . the first one is related to the claim that the 68% or 95% confidence level or credible intervals are more meaningful than the full curve . the fact that experimental measurements are often summarized as one- or two standard deviation intervals is just a matter of convention and if the curve has a complicated shape , it can not be reduced to a one or two - number description without loss of information . we emphasize that the full answer is given by the posterior distribution , and reporting only these summaries in the case of complex distributions ( e.g. multimodal and/or asymmetrical pdfs ) can be misleading , because people tend to think of a gaussian model if no further information is provided . _ '' ( g.  dagostini , 2003  @xcite ) . ] in particular for the present case , we emphasize the importance of having exactly degenerate peaks in the angle @xmath0 ( as are reproduced by the constrained frequentist fit , see below ) to be in agreement with isospin symmetry no matter the values of the 68% or 95% error intervals . the second misconception is related to the above misunderstanding of the meaning of the degeneracy that is intrinsic to the isospin analysis . the fact that with the new data from summer 2006  @xcite one sees only four peaks instead of eight as a function of @xmath0 is not related to the improved measurements , but to the fact that now the experimental central values are slightly outside the physical region that is defined by the isospin symmetry ( which is related to the property that both the three amplitudes and their @xmath6 conjugates must form a triangle in the complex plane ) . most presumably the data will evolve in such a way that the eightfold ambiguity reappears , which is the general case in the mathematical sense , and not a `` fortuitous accident '' as claimed in  @xcite . would a different ambiguity pattern be confirmed by better data , then either the standard model or the isospin symmetry should be questioned . the authors of ref . @xcite recommend that the `` default '' plot summarizing the present constraints on the angle @xmath0 coming from @xmath5 decays should take into account additional theoretical and phenomenological information . the physical arguments that are presented in favor of such an approach are perfectly legitimate and we do not object them . however the problem that was studied in detail in  @xcite is not this one , but rather the original isospin analysis . let us recall the advantages of performing the analysis assuming only isospin symmetry . * neither isospin symmetry nor @xmath5 experimental measurements give any insight on the typical scale of the hadronic amplitudes ; thus it is a natural choice for the experimental collaborations to present their results in a way that is independent of possible assumptions on the hadronic amplitudes . * the original paper  @xcite only assumed isospin symmetry . * one can think of many relevant physical problems containing completely free unknown parameters , the typical scale of which is not controlled even as an order of magnitude . this is the case , _ e.g. _ , of general beyond the standard model scenarios where one parametrizes new arbitrary contributions with a few quantities that _ a priori _ can take any value . the original isospin analysis is thus a pedagogical example that exhibit many features that would appear in more general situations .    having this in mind we can now examine the new proposal of ref . first we remark that the statement made in  @xcite according to which one can get new constraints on @xmath0 , and eventually lift the degeneracies and suppress the solution at @xmath7 , provided one uses additional theoretical and phenomenological knowledge , is obviously trivial and was the guideline of , e.g. , section vi.1 of ref . @xcite and many similar studies in the past . second we stress that additional information is ill - defined . the assumptions made in  @xcite are equivalent to an analysis with a finite theoretical error on each parameter ( except the one that is scanned , here the angle @xmath0 ) , such as the `` historical '' determination of the unitarity triangle  @xcite . it is well known that in general there is no unambiguous definition of the meaning of a theoretical error , and when such uncertainties are present the bayesian and frequentist methods can not be compared in a rigorous way . the authors of ref . @xcite take as a strong argument in favor of their approach the fact that their results are weakly dependent of the assumed order of magnitude for the amplitudes . we do not find this convincing , but rather would like to take the following two limits , which to our knowledge are the only ones where the concept of a theoretical error becomes perfectly well defined . * theory errors go to zero , _ i.e. _ the corresponding parameters are fixed constants . in this case it is trivial to show that both frequentist and bayesian approaches lead to equivalent numerical results . * theory errors go to infinity , _ i.e. _ the corresponding parameters are completely free unknowns ; this is the case that is discussed in the previous section and where the bayesian treatment in a generic parameterization simply fails . hence , only in the very specific case where both experimental and theoretical uncertainties are `` sufficiently '' reduced , and there is no free parameter , the numerical comparison of the bayesian treatment with the frequentist classical approach may become meaningful , and in the bayesian case one might expect a `` reasonable '' stability with respect to priors and parameterization . this stability , however , must be extensively checked case - by - case , which has not been done in the previous publications by the utfit collaboration  @xcite .    , taking into account the following constraints  @xcite : @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( natural units ) , for @xmath5 decays . upper plot : data that correspond to the plots in ref . @xcite , lower plot : new data that correspond to fig .  5 in  @xcite .

[ constrainedfit],title=""fig:"",scaledwidth=40.0% ] [ constrainedfit ] shows the results of a constrained frequentist fit that takes into account the same information on the hadronic parameters as in fig .  5 of  @xcite , namely that the amplitudes verify the following bounds : @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( in natural units ) . in particular these bounds suppress the parameter configurations with @xmath2 , as emphasized in  @xcite . have a good confidence level because large , but finite , values for the hadronic amplitudes can generate the observed @xmath6 violation . however the @xmath6-conserving value @xmath11 is strongly disfavored in the standard model , so that the confidence level is discontinuous at this point , as explained in  @xcite . contrary to the claims in  @xcite , these results are in perfect agreement with quantum field theory and do not violate any fundamental principle . ] indeed this curve is not too different from the one that corresponds to the bayesian treatment , however it appears clearly that the frequentist analysis , in contrast to the bayesian one , respects the exact degeneracy between the mirror solutions that survive the phenomenological bounds , as requested by the symmetries of the problem . table  [ param ] shows the parameter values that correspond to each of the peaks in the plots of fig . [ constrainedfit ] , as obtained analytically from the exact formulas or numerically from the fit . ) , the exact degeneracy of the constrained fit is only threefold because the central values are outside the physical region ; again the parameter values that correspond to the peaks exactly reproduce the same observable values , and all satisfy the phenomenological bounds on the amplitudes , so that there is no possibility to tell which solution is to be preferred . ] since these parameter configurations all lead to the very same observables and all verify the phenomenological bounds advocated in ref . @xcite , there is no way to tell which configuration is `` more probable '' . in turn , this means that the bayesian treatment lifts the degeneracy only because of the unphysical marginalization over the hadronic parameters , and that reducing the output information to the 68% or 95% probability intervals is very misleading . from table [ param ] one sees that to lift the degeneracy between the remaining solutions , even partially , one would need to know the amplitudes with a relative uncertainty of better than 100% , which is feasible using more dynamical approaches to hadronic elements , but which would request far more than just isospin symmetry and orders of magnitude for the hadronic amplitudes .    to close this section we emphasize that there are many interesting problems depending on completely unknown parameters on which we have no clue , not even a rough order of magnitude . this is for example the case in generic new physics scenarios , such as the one of the second paper of ref . @xcite . there arbitrary new physics contributions to @xmath12 mixing is parametrized by a quantity @xmath13 ; by definition , since no assumption is made on specific new physics models , the analysis does not give any insight to the `` natural '' scale of the parameter @xmath14 . thus one again may expect the bayesian treatment to suffer from instabilities when moving from , e.g , the @xmath15 to the @xmath16 parameterization ( such instabilities are expected to increase with the number of new physics parameters ) . in other words the bayesian approach as recommended by ref . @xcite can not be applied ( although in practice it is ) to the full generality of problems at hand . centre de physique thorique is umr 6207 du cnrs associe aux universits daix - marseille i et ii et universit du sud toulon - var ; laboratoire affili  la frumam - fr2291 . this work was supported in part by the eu contract no . mrtn - ct-2006 - 035482 , `` flavianet '' . 9 m.  bona _ et al . _ [ utfit collaboration ] , arxiv : hep - ph/0701204 j.  charles _ et al . _ , arxiv : hep - ph/0607246 m.  bona _ et al . _ [ utfit collaboration ] , jhep * 0507 * ( 2005 ) 028 ; jhep * 0603 * ( 2006 ) 080 ; jhep * 0610 * ( 2006 ) 081 m.  gronau and d.  london , phys . rev . lett . * 65 * ( 1990 ) 3381 m.  gronau and j.  zupan , phys . d * 71 * ( 2005 ) 074017 m.  ciuchini _ et al . _ , jhep * 0107 * ( 2001 ) 013 g.  dagostini , rep . * 66 * ( 2003 ) 1383 the heavy flavor averaging group , http://www.slac.stanford.edu/xorg/hfag/ j.  charles _ et al . _ [ ckmfitter group ] , eur . phys . j. c * 41 * ( 2005 ) 1","The text discusses the challenges and limitations of the Bayesian treatment of hadronic amplitudes in the context of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) angle, denoted as @xmath0.

"thermotropic liquid crystals exhibit exotic phase behavior upon temperature variation . the nematic phase is rich with a long - ranged orientational order but lacks translational order . the isotropic - nematic ( i - n ) phase transition , which is believed to be weakly first order in nature with certain characteristics of the continuous transition , has been a subject of immense attention in condensed matter physics and material sciences @xcite . in contrast , the dynamics of thermotropic liquid crystals have been much less studied , the focus being mostly on the long - time behavior of orientational relaxation near the i - n transition @xcite . a series of optical kerr effect ( oke ) measurements have , however , recently studied collective orientational relaxation in the isotropic phase near the i - n transition over a wide range of time scales @xcite . the dynamics have been found to be surprisingly rich , the most intriguing feature being the power law decay of the oke signal at short - to - intermediate times @xcite . the relaxation scenario appears to be strikingly similar to that of supercooled molecular liquids @xcite , even though the latter do not undergo any thermodynamic phase transition . although the analogous dynamics have been investigated in subsequent studies @xcite , a quantitative estimation of glassy dynamics of rodlike molecules near the i - n transition still eludes us . the prime objective of this paper is to provide a quantitative measure of glassy dynamics near the i - n transition . to this end , we have undertaken molecular dynamics simulations of a family of model systems consisting of rodlike molecules across the i - n transition in search of glassy behavior . given the involvement of the phase transition to an orientationally ordered mesophase upon lowering the temperature , we choose to probe the single - particle orientational dynamics . we have defined a fragility index and explored plausible correlation of the features of the underlying energy landscape with the observed fragility in analogy with supercooled liquids . the systems we have studied consist of ellipsoids of revolution . the gay - berne ( gb ) pair potential @xcite , that is well established to serve as a model potential for systems of thermotropic liquid crystals , has been employed . the gb pair potential , which uses a single - site representation for each ellipsoid of revolution , is an elegant generalization of the extensively used isotropic lennard - jones potential to incorporate anisotropy in both the attractive and the repulsive parts of the interaction @xcite.in the gb pair potential , @xmath0th ellipsoid of revolution is represented by the position @xmath1 of its center of mass and a unit vector @xmath2 along the long axis of the ellipsiod . the interaction potential between two ellipsoids of revolution @xmath0 and @xmath3 is given by    @xmath4    where @xmath5 here @xmath6 defines the thickness or equivalently , the separation between the two ellipsoids of revolution in a side - by - side configuration , @xmath7 is the distance between the centers of mass of the ellipsoids of revolution @xmath0 and @xmath3 , and @xmath8 is a unit vector along the intermolecular separation vector @xmath9 . the molecular shape parameter @xmath10 and the energy parameter @xmath11 both depend on the unit vectors @xmath2 and @xmath12 as well as on @xmath13 as given by the following set of equations : @xmath14^{-1/2}\ ] ] with @xmath15 and @xmath16^{\nu } [ \epsilon_{2}({\bf \hat r}_{ij},{\bf e}_{i},{\bf e}_{j})]^{\mu}\ ] ] where the exponents @xmath17 and @xmath18 are adjustable parameter , and @xmath19^{-1/2}\ ] ] and @xmath20\ ] ] with @xmath21 . here @xmath22 is the aspect ratio of the ellipsoid of revolution with @xmath23 denoting the separation between two ellipsoids of revolution in a end - to - end configuration , and @xmath24 , and @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the depth of the minimum of the potential for a pair of ellipsoids of revolution aligned in a side - by - side configuration , and @xmath27 is the corresponding depth for the end - to - end alignment . @xmath28 is the depth of the minimum of the pair potential between two ellipsoids of revolution alligned in cross configuration . the gb pair potential defines a family of models , each member of which is characterized by the values chosen for the set of four parameters @xmath29 and @xmath18 , and is represented by gb(@xmath30 ) @xcite . three systems , namely gb(3 , 5 , 2 , 1 ) , gb(3.4 , 5 , 2 , 1 ) , and gb(3.8 , 5 , 2 , 1 ) , that differ in the aspect ratio have been investigated . molecular dynamics simulations have been performed with each of these systems , consisting of 500 ellipsoids of revolution , in a cubic box with periodic boundary conditions . each of these systems has been studied along three isochors ( @xmath31 = 0.31 , 0.32 , and 0.33 for @xmath32 = 3.0 ; @xmath31 = 0.25 , 0.26 , and 0.27 for @xmath32 = 3.4 ; @xmath31 = 0.215 , 0.225 , and 0.235 for @xmath32 = 3.8 ) at several temperatures , starting from the high - temperature isotropic phase down to the nematic phase across the i - n phase boundary . all quantities are given in reduced units defined in terms of the gay - berne potential parameters @xmath28 and @xmath33 : length in units of @xmath33 , temperature in units of @xmath34 , and time in units of @xmath35 , m being the mass of the ellipsoids of revolution . the mass as well as the moment of inertia of each of the ellipsoids of revolution have been set equal to unity . the intermolecular potential is truncated at a distance @xmath36and shifted such that @xmath37 , @xmath7 being the separation between two ellipsoids of revolution i and j. the equations of motion have been integrated using the velocity - verlet algorithm with integration time step @xmath38 @xcite . equilibration has been done by periodic rescaling of linear and angular velocities of particles . this has been done for a time period of @xmath39 following which the system has been allowed to propagate with a constant energy for a time period of @xmath40 in order to ensure equilibration upon observation of no drift of temperature , pressure , and potential energy . the data collection has been executed in a microcanonical ensemble . at each state point , local potential energy minimization has been executed by the conjugate gradient technique for a subset of @xmath41 statistically independent configurations . the landscape analysis has been done with a system size of @xmath42 ellipsoids of revolution , which is big enough for having no qualitative change in the results due to the system size @xcite . minimization has been performed with three position coordinates and two euler angles for each particle , the third euler angle being redundant for ellipsoids of revolution . the single - particle second rank orientational time correlation function ( otcf ) @xmath43 is defined by @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the second rank legendre polynomial , @xmath46 is the unit vector along the long axis of @xmath0th ellipsoid of revolution , and the angular brackets stand for ensemble averaging . figure [ fig : power ] shows the time evolution of the single - particle second rank otcf for one of the three systems considered here as the temperature is lowered along an isochor from the high - temperature isotropic phase down to the nematic phase across the i - n phase boundary . in the inset , the average orientational order parameter @xmath47 is shown as a function of temperature along the isochor @xcite . the variation of @xmath47 with temperature serves to locate the i - n phase boundary . in the present study , the i - n transition temperature @xmath48 is taken as the temperature at which @xmath47 of the system is @xmath49 . for each aspect ratio , three isochors at different densities have been considered . the qualitative behavior has been found to be the same for all the three systems along all the isochors studied ( data not shown ) . the emergence of the power law decay in the isotropic phase near the i - n transition is evident in all the cases as a universal characteristic of i - n transition @xcite . as the i - n phase boundary is crossed upon cooling , the advent of two power law decay regimes separated by an intervening plateau at short - to - intermediate times imparts a step - like feature to the temporal behavior of the second rank otcf . such a feature bears remarkable similarity to what is observed for supercooled liquids as the glass transition is approached from the above @xcite . while for the supercooled liquid the emargence of step - like feature in the otcf is well understood as a consequence of @xmath50 relaxation , the origin of such a feature observed for liquid crystal defied of reliable explanation . we estimate the orientational correlation time @xmath51 as the time taken for @xmath43 to decay by @xmath52 , i.e. , @xmath53 . figure [ fig : frgl](a ) shows @xmath51 in the logarithmic scale as a function of the inverse temperature along the three isochors for each of the three systems considered . we have scaled the temperature by @xmath48 in the spirit of angell s plot , that displays the shear viscosity ( or the structural relaxation time , the inverse diffusivity , etc . ) of glass - forming liquids as a function of the inverse of the scaled temperature , the scaling being done in the latter case by the glass transition temperature @xmath54 @xcite . for all the three systems , two distinct features are common : ( i ) in the isotropic phase far away from the i - n transition , the orientational correlation time @xmath51 exhibits the arrhenius temperature dependence , i.e. , @xmath55 $ ] , where the activation energy @xmath56 and the pre - factor @xmath57 are both independent of temperature ; ( ii ) in the isotropic phase near the i - n transition , the temperature dependence of @xmath51 shows marked deviation from the arrhenius behavior and can be well described by the vogel - fulcher - tammann ( vft ) equation @xmath58 $ ] , where @xmath57 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 are constants , independent of temperature . again these features bear remarkable similarity with those observed for fragile glass - forming liquid . a non - arrhenius temperature behavior is taken to be the signature of fragile liquids . for fragile liquids , the temperature dependence of the shear viscosity follows the arrhenius behavior far above @xmath54 and can be fitted to the vft functional form in the deeply supercooled regime near @xmath54 @xcite . the striking resemblance in the dynamical behavior described above between the isotropic phase of thermotropic liquid crystals near the i - n transition and supercooled liquids near the glass transition has prompted us to attempt a quantitative measure of glassy behavior near the i - n transition . for supercolled liquids , one quantifies the dynamics by a parameter called fragility index which measures the rapidity at which the liquid s propeties ( such as viscosity ) change as the glassy state is approached . in the same spirit @xcite that offers a quantitative estimation of the fragile behavior of supercooled liquids , we here define the fragility index @xmath61 of a thermotropic liquid crystalline system as @xmath62 figure [ fig : frgl](b ) shows the density dependence of the fragility index for the three systems with different aspect ratios . for a given aspect ratio , the fragility index increases with increasing density , the numerical values of the fragility index @xmath61 being comparable to those of supercooled liquids . the change in the fragility index for a given density difference ( @xmath63 ) increases with the decrease in the aspect ratio . another hallmark of fragile glass - forming liquids is spatially heterogeneous dynamics @xcite reflected in non - gaussian dynamical behavior @xcite . it is intuitive that the growth of the pseudo - nematic domains , characterized by local nematic order , in the isotropic phase near the i - n transition would result in heterogeneous dynamics in liquid crystals . we have , therefore , monitored the time evolution of the rotational non - gaussian parameter ( ngp ) @xcite , @xmath64 , which in the present case is defined as @xmath65 where @xmath66 here @xmath67 is the rotation vector like the position vector @xmath1 appears incase of translational ngp of @xmath0th ellipsoid of revolution , the change of which is defined by @xmath68 , @xmath69 being the corresponding angular velocity @xcite , and @xmath70 is the number of ellipsoids of revolution in the system . ngp will have value equal to zero when system dynamics is spatially homogeneous and will have a non - zero value when the system dynamics is spatially heterogeneous . as a typical behavior , fig . [ fig : rngp](a ) shows the time dependence of the rotational ngp for one of the systems at several temperatures across the i - n transition along an isochor . on approaching the i - n transition upon cooling , a bimodal feature starts appearing with the growth of a second peak , which eventually becomes the dominant one , at longer times . we further investgate the apearance of this bimodal feature in ngp plot . to this end we calculate mean square angular deviation ( msad ) of the system at different temperatures starting from high temperature isotropic phase to low temperature nematic phase . the appearance of the bimodal feature in the rotational ngp is accompanied by a signature of a sub - diffusive regime in the temporal evolution of the mean square angular deviation ( msad ) , the time scale of the short - time peak and that of the onset of the sub - diffusive regime being comparable , as shown in fig . [ fig : rngp](b ) . we further note that the dominant peak appears on a time scale which is comparable to that of onset of the diffusive motion in orientational degrees of freedom ( odof ) as evident in fig . [ fig : rngp](b ) and similar feature has been observed recently for glassy systems @xcite also . we also observe that the time scale at which long - time peak appears is also comparable to the onset of the plateau that is observed in the time evolution of @xmath43 , as shown in fig . [ fig : rngp](c ) . this striking similarities of the dynamics between liquid crystals near i - n transition and supercooled liquid near glass transition are also supported by the use of mode coupling theory ( mct ) to explain the dynamics of both the systems . while mct was used first for the supercooled liquid , recently it has been used for liquid crystals also . mct theory devloped by gottke et al . @xcite predicts that near i - n transition , the low frequency rotational memory kernel should diverge in a power law fashion . @xmath71 mean field treatment gives @xmath72 . invoking the rank ( @xmath73 ) dependence of the memory function , the single particle otcf can be written as @xcite @xmath74^{-1}\ ] ] the above equation can be laplace inverted to obtain a short - to - intermadiate power law decay in @xmath43 which is a universal characteristic of the i - n transition for several model liquid crystals @xcite . recently , @xcite have showed that it is also possible to formulate a schematic model that combines short - to - intermediate time relaxation with long time relaxation . in their model , they have expressed the total memory functon ( @xmath75 ) as the sum of mode coupling memory function ( @xmath76 ) and landau - de gennes memory function ( @xmath77 ) . @xmath78 where @xmath79 @xmath80 is the characteristic frequecny and @xmath81 . time dependence of @xmath82 can be written expressed in terms of the memory function @xmath83 @xcite and @xmath83 has the following form @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the autocorrelation function of the anisotropy of the polarizability and @xmath86 is the solution of a @xmath87 schematic model for what is referred to as the density correlator . @xmath32 being the coupling constant between them . now , @xmath77 can be written as @xmath88 here @xmath89 is the relaxation time ( @xmath90 ) and it diverges as @xmath91 as the critical temperature @xmath92 of the i - n transition is approached from the above . following the calculation of ref . @xcite , one can get two important relaxation equattions . @xmath93 with the initial conditions @xmath94 and @xmath95 and @xmath96 with the initial conditions @xmath97 and @xmath98 . @xmath99 and @xmath17 are the damping constants . @xmath100 is identical to one gets from the mct analysis of the supercooled liquids . difference between this scematic model and one applied for the supercooled liquid is in eq . @xmath101 . if @xmath102 is set equal to @xmath103 in eq . @xmath101 , the supercooled model is recovered . @xmath101 is the orientational correlation function coupled to the density correlation function with specific new terms that account for the long - time portion of the relaxation profile that has been previously described by ldg theory . several studies have attempted to interpret the fragility of glass - forming liquids in terms of the features of the underlying energy landscapes @xcite . energy landscape analysis gives the potential energy , which devoids of any kind of thermal motions , of inherent structures of the parent liquid and hence provide a better understanding of the structure and dynamics of the paprent liquid . a recent study on thermotropic liquid crystals has reported the temperature dependent exploration of the energy landscapes of a family of the gay - berne model systems across the mesophases @xcite . the average inherent structure ( is ) energy @xmath104 has been found to fall as @xmath47 grows across the i - n phase boundary and through the nematic phase in contrast to its insensitivity to the temperature in the high - temperature isotropic phase and the low - temperature smectic - b phase @xcite . such a fall in the average is energy is consistent with a gaussian form for the number density of inherent structures with energy @xmath105 , that predicts a linear variation of @xmath104 with the inverse temperature : @xmath106 , where @xmath107 and @xmath10 are parameters independent of temperature and @xmath108 is the boltzmann constant @xcite . note that this has been observed for a glassy system @xcite , where the average is energy also falls over a temperature range @xcite . in fig . [ fig : lscp](a ) , we demonstrate with the original and the most studied parameterization for the gb pair potential gb@xmath109 that the prediction holds good over the temperature range where @xmath104 is on a decline along all the three isochors studied . it then follows that a plot of @xmath110 versus @xmath111/@xmath112 would result in a collapse of the @xmath104 data for all densities onto a straight line with negative unit slope . this is indeed found to be true , as shown in fig . [ fig : lscp](b ) , implying the validity of the gaussian model in this case as well . it may be noted that when the distribution of is energy is gaussian , the fragility of glass - forming liquids has been shown to depend on the total number of inherent structures , the width of the gaussian , and the variation of the basin shape with the average is energy @xcite . the origin of the glassy orientational dynamics , both single particle and collective , of nematogens near the isotropic - nematic transition has been addressed in several publications in recent years @xcite . in these studies , the similarity between dynamics of supercooled glassy liquid and liquid crystals has been discussed in detail , but no quantitative measure of the similarity was provided . the fragility index introduced here serves to remove that lacuna . it is indeed surprising that even the values of the fragility parameter are in the range observed for glassy liquids as well . this is in agreement with the repeated observation by fayer and coworkers that the values of the power law exponents observed in the two systems are quite similar . further understanding of the relaxation mechanism has been obtained from a closure look on the heterogeneous dynamics . as figure 3 demonstrates , the rotational non - gaussian parameter shows a dramatic enhancement of hetrogeneous dynamics as the i - n phase boundary is approached . unlike what is found near the gas - liquid critical point @xcite , the single - particle dynamics near the i - n phase boundary are observed to be strongly affected by the approaching thermodynamic singularity . we have discussed mode coupling theory approaches introduced to understand anomalous dynamics observed in this problem .    * acknowledgments * it is a pleasure to thank professor s. sastry for helpful discussions . this work was supported in parts by grants from dst and csir , india . b.j . acknowledges csir , india and d.c . acknowledges ugc , india for providing research fellowship","The text discusses the dynamics of thermotropic liquid crystals near the isotropic-nematic (i-n) phase transition.

"carbon nanotubes ( cnts ) are ideal model systems for the exploration of electrical transport in low dimensions.@xcite two sorts of nanotubes ( nts ) exist : single - wall and multi - wall nts . an ideal ( undoped ) swnt can be either metallic or semiconducting , but here , we only focus on metallic nts . in these tubes , the current is carried by two modes , modes , spin - degeneracy is not included . ] leading to a conductance of @xmath4 , provided backscattering is absent . recent experiments have shown that scattering within metallic swnt is weak . in a particular nice experiment the electrostatic potential drop along a voltage - biased nt was measured by using the tip of an atomic - force microscope as a probe.@xcite for swnts , most of the potential drops at the contacts . in contrast , for mwnts a considerable fraction of the potential drops along the tube , suggesting intrinsic scattering in mwnts . a length dependent resistance was deduced before from electric resistance measurements on multiply contacted mwnts.@xcite the typical value for the resistance per unit length is . we mention , that there is one conflicting results : frank _ et al._@xcite came to the conclusion that mwnts are ballistic conductors even at room temperature.d subbands is comparable to @xmath5 . ] seemingly compelling evidence for diffusive transport in mwnts is provided by measurements of the magnetoresistance , both in parallel and perpendicular magnetic field.@xcite for example , the resistance modulation in parallel magnetic field can be described very well by the altshuler - aronov - spivak ( aas ) theory ( weak - localization in a cylindrical conductor ) , which relies on _ diffusive _ transport.@xcite these experiments did also show that the electrical current is preferentially carried by the outermost tube , at least at low temperatures . hence , a single nanotube is probed , albeit one with a large diameter of , which is about ten times larger than that of prototype swnts . as emphasized before , a metallic swnt is characterized by only @xmath6 @xmath2d - modes , a property that should be independent of the diameter . how can we than reconcile the availability of only @xmath7 modes for an ideal nt with the observation of diffusive motion . diffusive transport requires @xmath8 . may it be that mwnts are doped to a such a degree that @xmath8 ?    by using a new gating technique ( electrochemical gating ) , we have recently shown that mwnts are indeed ( hole- ) doped.@xcite the number of @xmath2d - modes is @xmath9 , but rather @xmath10 , see section  2 . mwnts are not single - mode , but rather few mode quasi - one - dimensional wires . whether they are @xmath2d diffusive , i.e. quasi - ballistic with a mean - free path @xmath11 exceeding the circumference @xmath12 , or @xmath13 diffusive is another question .    taking ( @xmath14 is tube length ) , yields which is of order of the circumference . this simple estimate is in good agreement with measurements of the energy - dependent tunneling dos @xmath15 . @xmath15 is not structureless , as would be expected if , but shows features reminiscent of quantization into @xmath2d - modes , albeit with some broadening.@xcite    recently , we have studied gate - induced conductance fluctuations in mwnts at low temperatures and tried to compare the measurements with ucf theory . in the regime of thermally - induced averaging , i.e. for tubes which are much longer than the phase - coherence length @xmath16 and/or the thermal length @xmath17 , the functional dependence is in agreement with theory . these data allow to deduce @xmath16 , which follows nyquist - dephasing below . however , when we approach the universal limit , i.e. if @xmath18 , the temperature dependence of conductance fluctuations markedly deviates from standard theories . this has led us to study shorter tubes in more detail by measuring the differential conductance @xmath19 as a function of transport voltage @xmath20 and gate voltage @xmath21 in the fully coherent regime , i.e. for @xmath22 . displaying @xmath23 in a greyscale plot helps to recognize the underlying physics . this is in particular true for single - electron charging effects which might be present simultaneously to quantum interference effects , both modulating the equilibrium conductance . single - electron charging effects ( single - electron tunneling = set ) , such as coulomb blockade and coulomb oscillations were observed in swnts from the beginning.@xcite however , in our own work on mwnts we have never observed clear evidence of coulomb blockade until now . we have argued that this absence is due to the low - ohmic contacts in our experiments , which are always of order .@xcite in contrast , measurements on mwnts with high - ohmic contacts ( ) display the conventional features of single - electron charging effects.@xcite the evaporation of au over the nanotubes , the method we prefer for fabricating contacts , leads to contact resistances that can be as low as at room temperature . this is low enough to suppress set . at cryogenic temperature , however , contact resistances usually increase , so that set may show up . in section  3 we present our first ( and still rare ) observation of set in transport through a mwnt with ` low - ohmic ' contacts . since the coupling to the contacts is rather strong , the conductance is dominated by higher - order co - tunneling processes . these new data allow to extract the single - particle level spacing @xmath24 of the mwnt quantum dot . similar to the result from electrochemical gating , the measured @xmath24 suggests that @xmath25 modes are occupied . in order to determine the degree of doping in mwnts ( or other nanotubes ) the position of the fermi energy need to be determined . one possible approach is to measure the conductance as a function of a gate voltage @xmath21 , which shifts the fermi energy @xmath0 . if the conductance @xmath26 increases ( decreases ) with increasing @xmath0 , the nt is n - doped ( p - doped ) , see fig . 1a . at , or in the vicinity of the charge - neutrality point ( cnp ) , the number of modes is minimal . it is @xmath7 for a metallic tube and zero for a semiconducting one.d bandstructure in fig . 1a is considerably smeared , so that no abrupt transitions are expected if @xmath0 crosses a band onset . ] hence , one expects to see a conductance minimum ( or a resistance maximum ) if @xmath0 crosses the cnp . ideally , for an undoped nt , @xmath0 should lie at the cnp and the resistance maximum should appear at @xmath27 . if this maximum is observed at @xmath28 , the fermi level is shifted due to some doping . in order to deduce @xmath0 from the measured gate voltage , the electrochemical capacitance between gate and nt needs to be known . conventional back gates ( see fig . 1b ) have relatively low capacitance . consequently fermi - level shifts are small even for large applied gate voltages . in this case , the resistance maximum can not be measured , and hence , the doping level can not be determined . this problem is circumvented in our approach , in which the coupling capacitance is made very large . we immerse the nanotube into an electrolyte through which gating is achieved , see fig  1c . for details , see ref . very large gate capacitances are possible due to the large double - layer capacitance of the electrolyte nt interface . this has an important implication : because the double - layer capacitance is much larger than the electrochemical capacitance of the nt , the total capacitance ( series connection of the two ) is determined by the nanotube alone . hence , there is a one - to - one correspondence between gate - voltage change @xmath29 and fermi level shift @xmath30 , i.e. @xmath31 .    electrochemical gating is studied at room temperature on single mwnts with lithographically defined au contacts evaporated over the nts . the nanotube - contact structure is fabricated on degenerately doped si with a thick spacer layer . the subtsrate can be used as a conventional backgate , fig  1b . if , as outlined in fig . 1c , a positive gate voltage @xmath21 is applied , the nt - electrolyte interface is polarized by the attraction of cations . consequently , the fermi level increases in the nt to maintain charge neutrality . an example for the dependence of the nanotube resistance on ( electrochemical ) gate voltage is shown in fig .  2 . a pronounced resistance maximum is seen at @xmath32 , which we identify as the cnp . in order to reach the cnp the fermi energy must first be raised by . this suggests that the nt is considerably hole - doped at @xmath27 . there is , however , a time dependence ( not shown).@xcite after immersion , the resistance maximum is observed at a smaller voltage of . the position of maximum @xmath33 then gradually moves to larger voltages to finally stabilize at in this example . hence , the doping level increases in the electrolyte . typical fermi - level shifts in air ( before immersion ) amount to .    based on measurements of the electrical resistance of swnts in a controlled environment of different gases it was suggested that hole - doping is induced by by oxygen.@xcite our own experiments show that oxygen has an effect on the doping state of mwnts . however , the effect is weak , as much larger doping shifts are seen in ambient air . an example is shown in fig . , we compare the evolution of the resistance of a mwnt at zero ( back- ) gate voltage when exposed to oxygen and air . prior to exposure , the nt was annealed at in vacuum . as a consequence of added hole doping the resistance is seen to decrease . the decrease is much more pronounced for air than for oxygen . the resistance increases again in vacuum , nicely demonstrating that the oxidizing species are only weakly adsorbed . the strongest source of doping is most likely due to water , as large fermi - level shifts can be induced by water vapour alone .    for the interpretation of previous electrical measurements , the net doping concentration @xmath34 and the fermi - level shift for a ` virgin ' mwnt in air are important . typical values for the latter are . comparing this with the average @xmath2d subband spacing ( for a diameter nt ) , we conclude that @xmath35 subbands may contribute to the conductance instead of @xmath7 for an ideal metallic nt . a doping - induced corresponds to a doping concentration of , or expressed per surface area to giving approximately one elementary charge per @xmath36 carbon atoms . as mentioned in the introduction single - electron tunneling ( set ) such as coulomb oscillations have been observed in mwnts and swnts , provided the contacts were high - ohmic , i.e. .@xcite in the opposite limit of relatively low - ohmic contacts of order charging effects have not yet been observed in transport through mwnts . though we have observed pronounced conductance oscillations as a function of gate voltage  @xcite and also as a function of magnetic field in the latter type of samples  @xcite , these can not readily be assigned to charging effects , as the oscillations were strongly aperiodic . we have assigned these oscillations to quantum interference of non - interacting quasi - particles , with the interference being caused by the presence of randomly distributed scatterers . it may be that this interpretation need to be reconsidered , since we have recently observed set effects in mwnts low - ohmic contacts ( ) .    in order to entangle set from quantum interference it is useful to measure @xmath37 as a function of gate voltage @xmath21 and transport voltage @xmath20 . the obtained greyscale plots greatly helps to recognize the underlying physics .    in small ( semi ) isolated objects , like our mwnt devices , transport may be blocked by coulomb interaction ( coulomb blockade ) . this is the case , if the energy for adding a single electron to the tube ( the single - electron charging energy @xmath38 ) is larger than the thermal energy @xmath5 and if the object is only weakly coupled to external leads ( contact resistance @xmath39 ) . coulomb blockade is suppressed if the energy of two charge states are degenerate . for example , if @xmath40 , where @xmath41 denotes the total ground - state energy of the nt with @xmath42 electrons , an equilibrium current can flow via the sequence @xmath43 . such degeneracies can be induced by the gate voltage @xmath21 and appear in the simplest possible model ( constant interaction model ) periodic in @xmath21 . in swnts coulomb blockade has been observed by several groups before.@xcite until now , it was believed that mwnts do not display coulomb blockade because of low contact resistances . recently , we have observed clear signatures of single - electron charging in a long mwnt ( distance between the contacts ) with reasonably low - ohmic contacts ( i.e. contact resistance @xmath44 ) . an example is shown in fig . 4 . in ( a ) , measured for @xmath45 , a regular sequence is seen consisting of a large ` diamond ' followed by three smaller ones . this pattern suggests a four - fold degeneracy of the single - electron states which we assign to spin degeneracy and an additional twofold orbital degeneracy . the latter may be caused by a peculiar degeneracy inherent to the graphite lattice , the so - called k , k@xmath46 degeneracy which originates from the presence of two identical carbon atoms per unit cell . if this interpretation is correct , this is quite amusing , because this basic feature has up to now not been seen in swnts . 4b shows @xmath37 measured at . now , an irregular sequence is observed . it is well known that the k , k@xmath46 degeneracy is lifted in magnetic - field . on the one hand , we do see clear signatures of coulomb blockade suggesting low transparent contacts . on the other hand , the measured two - terminal resistance is low , of order of @xmath47 , suggesting highly ( or intermediate ) transparent contacts . therefore , higher - order tunneling processes can play an important role in the electrical transport . a well known higher - order tunneling process is the kondo effect , i.e. the dynamic screening of the spin on the dot due to exchange - correlation effects between the dot state and the electrodes . we observe the kondo effect in a mwnt for the first time , see the features in fig . 4 . , which are highlighted by arrows . at @xmath48 and within the region of coulomb blockade there are two ` ridges ' of enhanced conductance . for the simplest filling scheme , i.e. @xmath49 , these ridges are expected to form in every second ` diamond ' where the spin is @xmath50 . the kondo effect has been observed before in swnts.@xcite    the data in fig .  4 allow to extract the single - particle level spacing @xmath24 . the large diamonds are large because an electron has to be added to a new level . the addition energy is therefore the sum of charging energy @xmath51 and @xmath24 . due to the fourfold degeneracy , the addition energy for the next three electrons is only @xmath51 . comparing the energies leads to a mean level spacing of . the @xmath52d level spacing is predicted to be for one mode , yielding ( ) . the number of modes participating is therefore . again we see that there are more than @xmath7 modes occupied in mwnts .. ]    since the measured two - terminal conductance @xmath53 , is a typical value for all our mwnt devices with contact separation @xmath54 nm . ] the mean transmission probability @xmath55 per mode is only @xmath56 ( here , we have taken @xmath57 ) . if all modes would have @xmath58 , co - tunneling effects like the kondo effects could safely be neglected . hence , there must be a distribution of transmission eigenvalues similar to that in many - mode diffusive wires . for the latter , random - matrix shows that the distribution is bimodal . although we are dealing with a very small ensemble ( only 10 modes ) , the distribution of transmission values is most likely bimodal , too . though there are @xmath25 modes available to accommodate charge , charge transport to the contacts is determined by only one mode ( or a very small number of modes ) . if the mode with highest transmission probability has the appropriate @xmath55 ( not too low , but also not too high ) , the kondo effect will show up.@xcite if @xmath55 is larger , the observed conductance pattern can no longer be assigned to co - tunneling set effects but rather reflects fabry - perot type interference.@xcite multi - wall nanotubes in air are hole doped , most likely induced by the adsorption of water . consequently , there are more than two @xmath2d - modes occupied . a typical number is @xmath59 , not counting spin degeneracy . estimates for the scattering mean - free path @xmath11 vary widely in the literature and also among our own experiments . however , surprisingly many experiments suggests that the @xmath11 is of order of the circumference of the tube . this may be a coincidence , but might also have a deeper reason : it was pointed out very early by white _ et al._@xcite that the mean - free path should grow with tube diameter @xmath60 according to @xmath61 , provided the number of scatterers per unit length is constant . on the other hand , if we assume that the source of scattering is a direct consequence of doping , the scattering density is proportional to the doping density which for a given environment can be taken to be constant . therefore , the number of dopants per unit length ( or the number of scatterers ) grows linearly with @xmath60 . the combination of both effects results in a diameter independent mean - free path . another argument for a diameter - independent mean - free path in mwnts was put forward by egger and gogolin.@xcite    at low temperature , single - electron tunneling ( set ) effects have been observed in mwnts with low - ohmic contacts , i.e. . this has allowed to determine the single electron level spacing which appears to be consistent with the estimated number of occupied modes deduced from electrochemical gating . the presence of co - tunneling points to high transmission at the contacts . even stronger : the prevailing absence of set effects in mwnts with @xmath53 suggests that at least one highly transmissive channel is present at low temperature . 99    for a review , see physics world , vol . 13 , no . 6 , june 2000 . a. bachtold _ et al . _ , lett . * 84 * , 6082 ( 2000 ) . c. schnenberger _ et al . _ , . phys . * a 69 * , 283 ( 1999 ) . s. frank _ et al . _ , science * 280 * , 1744 ( 1998 ) . a. bachtold _ et al . _ , nature * 397 * , 673 ( 1999 ) . m. krger _ et al . _ , . lett . * 78 * , 1291 ( 2001 ) . a. bachtold _ et al . _ , cond -

"the intrinsic non - gaussianity of primordial curvature perturbations is a valuable tool to distinguish among different models for the origin of structure in the very early universe  @xcite . even if the primordial curvature perturbation has a gaussian distribution , the initial density perturbation is non - gaussian due to the non - linearity of the einstein field equations @xcite . non - gaussianity ( ng ) may be characterized by a variety of different parameters , which control the departure of the underlying probability distribution function ( pdf ) of primordial fluctuations from a purely gaussian distribution . these parameters can be related to the amplitude of connected @xmath2-point ( @xmath2-pt ) correlation functions of primordial curvature fluctuations that vanish for @xmath3 in the gaussian case . the connected @xmath2-pt functions may be scale- and shape - dependent , in a manner determined by the particular model that generates them . in this work , we will focus on the so - called local shape of ng , in which the primordial gravitational potential in coordinate space can be expressed as an expansion in powers of one or more gaussian random fields that determine the primordial density fluctuations . in this case 3-pt functions of curvature fluctuations are determined by a parameter , @xmath1 , that at lowest order in a perturbative expansion characterizes the skewness of the pdf of primordial fluctuations . 4pt functions are determined by parameters , @xmath0 and @xmath4 , controlling the kurtosis of the pdf at lowest order in perturbations . the recent release of planck data allows one to set the best constraints yet on primordial non - gaussian parameters from cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) data alone @xcite . the quantity @xmath1 ( local ) is now constrained to be @xmath5 at 2@xmath6 level , while @xmath7 ; an analysis of the constraints on @xmath0 local from planck data has yet to be completed , but the forecast @xmath8 error bar with planck data has been estimated to be @xmath9 by @xcite and @xmath10 by @xcite . it may be unlikely that we live in a universe with a large hierarchy between @xmath1 and @xmath0 local @xcite , but this possibility can not be excluded _ a priori _ and there are theoretical models able to predict this pattern ( see for example @xcite or the discussion in @xcite ) . since @xmath1 and @xmath0 control distinct features of the pdf ( skewness and kurtosis ) it is very important to have the best observational constraints on each of them . complementary observables have to be considered to set more stringent bounds on non - gaussian parameters , in particular on @xmath0 , and one possibility is to use the statistics of large - scale structure . pioneering papers by dalal et al @xcite , slosar et al @xcite , matarrese et al @xcite , afshordi and tolley @xcite highlighted an interesting feature of primordial ng of local shape : it introduces a specific correlation between modes of different wavelengths which leads to a characteristic scale dependence of the halo bias . much work has been done so far to explore this interesting topic ( see @xcite and @xcite for reviews ) . however it turns out to be challenging to disentangle the contributions from different non - gaussian parameters using only halo and matter power spectra , since the characteristic scale dependence of the bias is primarily sensitive to a particular combination of the @xmath1 and @xmath0 parameters @xcite . mild corrections associated with the red - shift dependence of the halo mass function have been used to set the first lss constraints on @xmath0 in @xcite , but it is difficult to convincingly distinguish the effect of @xmath1 from that of @xmath0 using only galaxy power spectra . independent constraints on @xmath1 from cmb are useful , but not conclusive because @xmath1 could be characterized by a significant scale dependence @xcite , that makes its value probed at lss scales different with respect to the one tested at cmb scales . a promising method that may break the degeneracy between @xmath1 and @xmath0 is to study the bispectra of halo and matter densities , which are sensitive to a non - linear bias parameter that depends specifically on @xmath0 , and allows us to break the aforementioned degeneracy . jeong and komatsu @xcite ( see also @xcite ) were the first among various groups to include the scale dependence of halo bias when studying bispectra , by considering the non - linear evolution of the halo overdensity in a local , univariate bias expansion , where the halo abundance is taken to be a function of the local density . they have shown that galaxy bispectra are sensitive to non - gaussian parameters beyond @xmath1 , as confirmed by @xmath11-body simulations @xcite . in this work , we elaborate on this subject . we will show that halo and matter bispectra have interesting qualitative features that may allow us to distinguish between the effects of different primordial ng parameters . we implement a peak - background split method within a barrier crossing approach to re - derive in part the results of @xcite in a physically transparent way , and to extend their analysis in various directions with the main aim of understanding how the parameters @xmath1 and @xmath0 can be possibly distinguished when analyzing the statistics of halo and matter bispectra .    in order to focus only on the consequences of primordial non - gaussian initial conditions on the properties of bispectra , we will not include the effects of non - linear gravitational clustering in our analysis ; that is , we work in lagrangian space and linearly transform to eulerian space . we also neglect non - linearity in the halo mass function , i.e. , non - linear local bias , which implies that any non - vanishing bispectra will be solely due to primordial ng . our work contains several results , and we present these in a modular way to render the paper easier to read . we begin with some theoretical sections discussing how to implement the peak - background split and barrier crossing approaches to determine concise analytical expressions for halo and matter bispectra , when the gravitational potential is a function of either single or multiple sources ( e.g. , due to fluctuations of single or multiple fields during inflation in the very early universe ) . our formulae are obtained by applying to bispectra the methods developed in @xcite for power spectra . see also @xcite for an interesting paper discussing how to implement the peak background splitting approach to bispectra . we use a generalization of the univariate bias approach , making the hypothesis that the local number of halos forming at a given position is a function of the matter contrast , _ and _ of its local correlation functions evaluated at that position . this is an alternative to the bivariate approach @xcite where the halo abundance is assumed to be a function of both the density field and the gravitational potential . in practice , the physical effect of long - wavelength modes of the potential is to modulate the small - scale variance of the density field in local models of ng . our extended univariate approach is physically transparent , and allows us to recover some of the results of the bivariate approach , in appropriate limits . in addition we can include local variations of effective non - gaussianity parameters on halo abundance @xcite . the resulting bispectra contain several contributions scaling with different powers of the scale @xmath12 , weighted by coefficients depending on primordial non - gaussian parameters . in the limit of large scales , in which analytic expressions for the transfer functions can be derived , we will discuss how bispectra have qualitative features that make it possible , at least in principle , to distinguish the effects of @xmath1 and @xmath0 . for example , by studying the properties of the bispectra as a function of the scale , we determine a connection between the sign of the halo bispectrum and ng parameters , in particular the value of @xmath0 . moreover , we show that there exists a combination of halo and matter bispectra that is sensitive to @xmath1 only , allowing us to probe @xmath1 without contaminations from @xmath0 . we then extend all these results , obtained in the case of a single source for the primordial gravitational potential , to a two - field example that allows us to understand how multiple sources contribute to galaxy bispectra . in @xcite it was pointed out that if multiple fields source the primordial gravitational potential , then halo overdensities need not be fully correlated with matter overdensities . we show that a combination of halo and matter power spectra is particularly convenient for studying the phenomenon of _ stochastic halo bias_. our analysis enable us to extend the concept of stochastic halo bias in the presence of primordial ng to the cases of both power spectra and bispectra , including the effect of @xmath0 . the fact that this stochastic bias is non - vanishing can be interpreted in terms of inequalities satisfied by primordial non - gaussian parameters , and these provide information on the number of fundamental fields sourcing ng . we determine a new combination of halo and matter bispectra whose value can be used to distinguish the effect of single and multiple sources on the primordial gravitational potential , and discuss its physical interpretation .    in the second part of our work , we apply our theoretical findings to a systematic numerical analysis of bispectra in appropriate squeezed limits , by using press - schechter halo mass functions supplemented by non - gaussian corrections controlled by an edgeworth expansion . this discussion enables us to apply our results to scales and redshifts that can be probed in present or future surveys . by plotting the resulting halo bispectra , we explore the different roles played by @xmath1 and @xmath0 . the numerical analysis confirms our analytical results . we show that qualitative features of the profiles of halo and matter bispectra as a function of the scale are sensitive to different ng parameters , possibly allowing us to test them individually . these results clearly demonstrate how galaxy bispectra have features that could distinguish between different non - gaussian parameters , in a way that is not possible by studying only the scale dependence of galaxy bias in power spectra of halos and matter . we conclude with a discussion on possible improvements and future directions for our investigation . we start with an introductory section outlining the ideas that we will use to treat the statistics of dark matter halos @xcite . the primordial gravitational potential @xmath13 is related to the linearly evolved matter density contrast @xmath14 in terms of the poisson equation in fourier space _ k(z)=|(k , z)_k , where |(k , z)=. @xmath15 is the matter transfer function normalized such that @xmath16 at large scales @xmath17 . @xmath18 is the linear growth factor , as a function of redshift @xmath19 . it is normalized such that @xmath20 in matter domination . at very large scales @xmath21 , the function @xmath22 is proportional to @xmath23 @xcite:[formulal ] |(k , z ) = _ 0(z)k^2 _ 0(z)2.1610 ^ 7()()^2 . this asymptotic behavior will be useful to get analytic results in the discussion of section [ subsec : squeezed ] . to render the formulae less cumbersome , from now on we will suppress the @xmath19 dependence . the field @xmath24 denotes the linear density contrast smoothed with a top - hat filter of radius @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the halo mass , and @xmath27 the background matter density . in fourier space , we write _ m()=w_m(k)_[smrel ] with @xmath28 the fourier transform of top - hat filter : w_m(k)=3 . we also define @xmath29 and @xmath30 . at large scales @xmath31 .    in what follows , we will investigate the statistical properties of the spatial distribution of galaxies . in the widely accepted model of galaxy formation , known as the _ halo model _ , galaxies form in the potential wells of gravitationally collapsed dark matter _ halos _ @xcite . the distribution of galaxies naturally follow the distribution of halos . there are various approaches to characterize their formation , and how they are distributed in space . in the barrier crossing approach , initiated by press and schechter @xcite , halos are thought to form when the matter linear overdensity field overcomes a certain threshold @xmath32 . we denote the number of halos of mass @xmath26 at time @xmath33 by @xmath34 : the press - schechter mass function gives the mean number density @xmath35 of halos as a function of the properties of the underlying linear matter overdensity field @xmath36 . in the following , we will drop the dependence on @xmath26 and @xmath33 ( or @xmath19 ) to simplify the notation .    in our work , we assume that @xmath37 depends on local physics only , i.e. it is a local function of @xmath38 and of its @xmath2-pt correlation functions @xmath39_v ( \vec{x})\,\equiv\ ,   \int_{{k}_i\ge \ell^{-1 } } \,\frac{d^3 k_1}{(2\pi)^3 } \dots \frac{d^3 k_n}{(2\pi)^3 }      \,e^{-i \left ( \vec{k}_1+\dots+\vec{k}_n \right)\,\vec{x}}\,\langle \delta_{\vec{k}_1}\dots \delta_{\vec{k}_n }   \rangle\ ] ] evaluated within a region @xmath40 around the position @xmath41 ( see section [ sec - ss ] for an additional discussion on this assumption ) : n_h ( ) = |n_h ( ( ) , _ v ( ) ) . the autocorrelations @xmath42_v$ ] depend on the primordial intrinsic ng of the fundamental fields that seed the gravitational potential @xmath13 . by measuring how the statistics of the halo displacement @xmath43 is related to the statistics of the matter density displacement @xmath14 , one can extract information about primordial ng . the local statistics of the autocorrelations @xmath42_v$ ] can be calculated using a heuristic but powerful method , the so called peak - background split approach @xcite . consider a large subvolume @xmath40 of the universe containing a large number of halos . take for concreteness a fiducial scale @xmath44 , say @xmath45 , still much larger than the scale associated with halos of mass @xmath26 . the linearized matter overdensity field @xmath38 can be decomposed into a short wavelength part @xmath46 and a long wavelength background @xmath47 with respect to the scale @xmath44 : [ sldec ] ( t,)=_short(t,)+_long(t , ) where the short and long wavelength contributions to @xmath48 are defined as _ short(t,)&=&_k ^-1 e^-i _ ( t ) + _ long(t,)&=&_k ^-1 e^-i _ ( t ) . the short mode @xmath46 at scales @xmath49 can be considered as the source of halos within the subvolume @xmath50 we are focussing on . as we mentioned above , locally @xmath35 depends on the quantity @xmath46 within the subvolume @xmath50 , and on its correlation functions @xmath51_v$ ] evaluated on the same subvolume . instead , distances larger than @xmath52 , associated with long mode @xmath47 , are the scales over which we measure the statistics of halo displacements @xmath53 . within the subvolume @xmath50 , @xmath47 acts as a smooth background density field in the linear regime . as we will discuss in the next sections , in the presence of primordial ng , @xmath47 has the important feature to modulate in a specific way the correlation functions @xmath51_v$ ] controlling the halo displacement @xmath53 . this implies that primordial ng of the gravitational potential controls the statistics of @xmath53 in such a way that it makes possible to extract from the latter unambiguous information on the former . hence , the barrier crossing approach and the peak - background split method allow us to analyze how primordial ng affects the statistics of lss . the connections between the two methods have been carefully discussed in @xcite : the statistics of @xmath47 has the effect to perturb the critical threshold that the linear part of @xmath46 has to reach to start to collapse , and it is this effect that renders the barrier crossing approach sensitive to primordial ng .    in the next sections , we will develop and apply these ideas to find quantitative results for the statistics of halo and matter displacements , both at the level of power spectrum and bispectrum , for single and multiple sources . we start analyzing the case of single source , extending to the case of the bispectrum the results of @xcite . we consider a large subvolume of the universe containing many halos , over which the long mode is reasonably constant , and we denote with @xmath54_{\rm v}$ ] a spatial average over this subvolume  while @xmath55 is the spatial average over the entire universe . in this section we consider a single gaussian field @xmath56 as an unique source for the primordial gravitational potential . we split such a field in long and short modes with respect to a fiducial scale @xmath44 : [ phisplit ] = _ s+_l . this gaussian field has zero average over the entire space @xmath57 , while non - zero average over the subvolume @xmath58_v$ ] , with @xmath40 : & = & 0 , + _ v&=&_l . we make a local expansion of the primordial gravitational potential up to third order in terms of the gaussian field @xmath56 : & = & + ( ^2-^2)+ ( ^3 -3 ^2 ) . after implementing the long / short splitting we introduced in eq . ( [ phisplit ] ) , we get in coordinate space & = & + ( ^2-^2 ) + ( ^3 -3 ^2 ) + & & + ( 1 + 2 + 3 ( ^2-^2 ) ) _ s + & & + ( + 3 ) ( _ s^2- [ _ s^2]_v ) + & & + ( _ s^3 -3 [ _ s^2 ] _ s ) . the previous expression demonstrates how the long wavelength mode modulates the gravitational potential . the coefficients of the different powers of @xmath59 , which control the statistics of this quantity within the subvolume @xmath50 , receive contributions depending on the long mode @xmath60 , and this acts as a background quantity from the point of view of the subvolume @xmath50 . in light of this , we can define the small scale effective power @xmath61_v^{1/2}$ ] , @xmath62 and @xmath63 as [ siges1 ] ( ^e ) & = & _ v^1/2 ( 1 + 2 + 3 ( ^2-^2 ) ) , + [ fnles1 ] ^e&=&+3 , + [ gnles1 ] ^e&= & , so we learn that long wavelength modes and primordial ng affect the two point statistics of the short modes , as well as the non - gaussian parameters inside the small box . the long mode dependence of eqs ( [ siges1])-([gnles1 ] ) will be used to estimate the number of halos at a given position . there are various approaches to the problem of quantifying how long modes contribute to the process of halo formation . the conceptually simplest one is to use an univariate approach , in which the number of halos is expressed in power series of @xmath14 , the matter density contrast . an univariate approach is used by jeong and komatsu @xcite . this method includes the effects of the long mode @xmath60 of the field sourcing the gravitational potential in the halo distribution , as much as @xmath60 modulates @xmath14 . a physical issue with this approach is that , strictly speaking , the number of halos does not depend only on the local value of the matter density contrast at a given position @xmath41 . indeed , it also depends on how the matter density contrast is _ distributed _ around @xmath41  that is , on its correlation functions evaluated at @xmath41 . in the presence of local ng , these correlation functions are affected by the long mode @xmath60 of the primordial field that sources the gravitational potential ( see eqs ( [ siges1 ] ) and ( [ fnles1 ] ) ) , in a way that is not completely described by the dependence of @xmath14 on @xmath60 . a way to deal with this issue was adopted by giannantonio and porciani @xcite : they propose a bivariate approach , in which the halo number density is expressed as power series in the long modes of both the matter density contrast _ and _ the gravitational potential . following this method , they show that the results fit better with n - body simulations . this approach has been then used by baldauf et al in @xcite for studying the features of galaxy bispectra .   here , we implement another method that allows us to overcome the conceptual difficulty outlined above . it is a generalization of the univariate approach that was introduced in @xcite in the context halo power spectra : we extend it to the study of bispectra . we assume that the number of halos at a given position , @xmath64 does not depend on the matter density contrast only , but also on all its correlation functions [ ansnhc ] n_h = n_h ( ( x ) , [ ^n]_v ( x ) ) . where @xmath65_v ( \vec x ) $ ] denotes the correlation function @xmath66 evaluated over a volume of size @xmath50 around the point @xmath41 . expressing the halo number as a function of the correlation functions of matter density contrast , we faithfully capture the contributions of the long mode @xmath60 on the process of halo formation . in a sense , the method that we adopt is a generalization of the univariate approach ; on the other hand , it is also able to include features associated with the long modes and primordial ng , like in the bivariate approach . in order to analyze the properties induced by primordial ng only , we perform a taylor expansion of the halo density contrast at first order in each of the arguments of @xmath35 in eq ( [ ansnhc ] ) . further terms in the expansion would induce further non - linearities on the long mode dependence of @xmath35 , and thus rely on the non - linear dependence of this function on the matter density contrast and its correlations . since we intend to focus our attention on the specific non - linearities associated with primordial ng only , and we do not have full theoretical control over higher derivatives of @xmath35 along the matter contrast correlation functions , we discard these contributions , although it would be interesting to include them in a more complete analysis ( see however section [ sec : gnllss ] for some discussion on this point ) . for the same reason , we do not include the effects of non - linear gravitational clustering in our analysis : that is , we work in lagrangian space and linearly transform to eulerian space . as we will see , our procedure leads to manageable expressions for the bispectra , that we use to derive interesting physical consequences ; we will also compare our results with others in the literature . let us now concretely apply the method we explained . we are assuming that the halo number density @xmath67 within the subvolume is a function of the one - point pdf of the underlying dark matter field @xmath36 , linearly evolved until today and smoothed over the halo scale . this matter field is proportional , via the @xmath28 and @xmath68 functions , to the gravitational potential @xmath13 within the halo region : @xmath69 . we define the quantity @xmath70 corresponding to the primordial gaussian long mode as _ l= _ l , that is , in terms of the linearly evolved long mode for the gaussian scalar field @xmath60 ( defined by integrating over small momenta the fourier transform of @xmath56 ) . we emphasize that , consistently with the barrier crossing approach , @xmath70 and @xmath36 are proportional to the linearly evolved primordial fluctuations . at very large scales , we can apply the transfer function to the poisson equation to express @xmath71 as should be intended as convolutions . we do this in order to keep a compact notation . ] [ expdm ] ^(l)_m=_l+ . notice that @xmath71 is made by a combination of powers of long wavelength ( gaussian ) modes . for weakly non - gaussian states , the one - point pdf in each subvolume can be characterized by its mean , variance , and higher connected cumulants . therefore , at very large scales , we can write an expansion for the halo displacement field [ expfdh ] _ h&=&b_g + & & + ( - 1 ) + ( ^e-)+ ( ^e- ) with the standard bias evaluated at ( @xmath72 ) by taking derivatives along the long wave - length mode @xmath71 [ eq : bg ] b_g=. moreover , we define at the same point [ eq : beta ] _ 2&=&2 0.5cm,0.5cm_3=3 0.5cm,0.5 cm _ a treatment similar to the previous one has been carried on also in @xcite , where the derivatives are done directly in terms of correlation functions instead of ng parameters . the quantities ( [ eq : bg])-([eq : beta ] ) depend on the specific halo mass function one considers : we will discuss theoretical expressions for the @xmath73 coefficients in section [ sec : gnllss ] using an extended press - schechter approach based on an edgeworth expansion . in the following analysis , we leave these parameters free .    using formulae ( [ siges1])-([gnles1 ] ) , eq . ( [ expfdh ] ) becomes [ eqn : deltah ] _ h&= & _ l(b_g+ + ) + & & + ( ^2-^2)(b_g+ _ 2 ) + & & + ( ^3 - 3 ^2 ) ( b_g ) .    we can collect these results in the convenient expression [ coldh ] _ h= b_1_l+(_l^2-_l^2 ) + ( _ l^3 - 3 _ l_l^2 ) , where we define the new bias parameters @xmath74 as b_1 & & b_g+ + [ eq : b1 ] , + b_2 & & 2 b_g + 3 _ 2 [ eq : b2 ] , + b_3 & & 6 b_g [ eq : b3 ] . the quantity @xmath75 corresponds to the linear bias . it receives a contribution due to primordial ng , that scales as @xmath76 at large scales : this is the well - known scale dependence of halo bias due to primordial ng . in this large scale limit , the linear bias function @xmath75 depends on a particular combination of @xmath1 and @xmath0 , and can not distinguish between these two quantities . on the other hand , the bias @xmath77 depends specifically on @xmath0 . in what follows , we study the bispectrum of halos and matter , which depend on @xmath77 : this can provide unambiguous information on @xmath0 allowing us to distinguish it from @xmath1 .    before continuing , we re - emphasize that in our approach we define the linear and non - linear bias in eq . ( [ coldh ] ) as coefficients of powers of the primordial , linear gaussian field @xmath60 : thus , @xmath53 acquires a non - gaussian statistics of purely local form , and this allows straightforward computation of @xmath2-point functions . the primordial quantity @xmath78 is then linearly evolved in terms of the function @xmath79 , consistently with the barrier crossing approach in which it is the linearly evolved gravitational potential that affects the formation of halos . within this framework , as we will see in what follows , one can easily derive analytic expressions for the coefficients @xmath73 used above , using an edgeworth expansion . on the other hand , our approach differs from the univariate method of jeong and komatsu @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , in which @xmath53 is expressed in terms of powers of the evolved matter field with its own non - gaussian features associated with non - linear evolution : we will discuss more in details in appendix [ app : comparison ] the differences among the results . nevertheless , our set - up has the virtue of being particularly intuitive and simple to deal with , and is fully consistent with the hypothesis at the basis of the barrier crossing approach that we adopt , that it is the linearly evolved matter density contrast that determines the formation of halos . as discussed above , our generalized univariate approach and results are more similar in spirit to the bivariate approach to bispectra adopted by baldauf et al @xcite : we will also compare in appendix [ app : comparison ] their results with our own . we adopt the following definitions for the power spectra associated with the two point functions of halo and matter densities p_mm(2)^3(+)&=&_m _ m , + p_hm(2)^3(+)&= & , + p_hh(2)^3(+)&=&_h _ h . we define the halo - halo power spectrum assuming that the shot - noise contribution @xmath80 has been subtracted , and analogously for the matter - halo and matter - matter power spectrum . using the formulae ( [ expdm ] ) , ( [ coldh ] ) and the linear , primordial power spectrum . ] @xmath81 , we find p_mm&= & , + p_hm&= & , + p_hh&= & .    in the limit of very large scales , we can express the previous expressions for the power spectra as p_mm&=&_0_0 ^ 2 k , + p_hm&=&k(_0b_g++ ) _ 0 _ 0 , + p_hh&=&k(_0b_g++ ) ^2_0 , neglecting the terms that are subleading in powers of @xmath12 , and using eq . ( [ formulal ] ) which also holds specifically at large scales . notice the famous scale dependence of halo bias induced by primordial ng in the halo - halo power spectrum . on the other hand , the primordial non - gaussian parameters @xmath1 and @xmath0 appear in the same footing in the previous expressions , rendering them difficult to disentangle . in order to overcome this degeneracy , in the following we will consider the statistics of three point function and study the bispectra of halo and matter density contrasts . the three point functions are defined as stands for @xmath82 . the same for @xmath83 . as for the power spectra , we assume that shot - noise contributions are removed . ] b_mmm(2)^3(_1+_2+_3)&=&_m _ m _ m , + b_hmm(2)^3(_1+_2+_3)&= & , + b_hhm(2)^3(_1+_2+_3)&= & , + b_hhh(2)^3(_1+_2+_3)&=&_h _ h _ h ,    obtaining at leading order ( tree - level )    b_mmm&=&2 _ 0 ^ 2 ^(1)^(2 ) ^(3)(++)[bsmmm ] , + b_hmm&=&\{_0 ^ 2^(2)^(3)+}[bshmm ] , + b_hhm&=&\{_0 ^ 2^(3)+}[bshhm ] , + b_hhh&=&_0 ^ 2(b_2^(1)+b_2^(2)+b_2^(3))[bshhh ] , where @xmath84 and @xmath85 . notice that the scale dependence of @xmath86 is due to primordial ng , and this induces a dependence on @xmath87 for these quantities ( see eqs . ( [ eq : b1])-([eq : b3 ] ) ) . in the previous formulae , we focussed only on tree - level contributions to the bispectra , neglecting so - called `` loop '' effects . for this reason , the bias parameter @xmath88 does not appear . focussing on the halo bispectrum , eq . ( [ bshhh ] ) , recall that the bias parameters @xmath75 and @xmath77 depend on primordial ng , see eqs ( [ eq : b1],[eq : b2 ] ) . we are thus able to recover the trispectrum dependent contributions identified by jeong and komatsu @xcite . we will explain in appendix [ app : comparison ] how to compare ( in appropriate limits ) our results with @xcite : for the moment , we will elaborate the physical consequences of our findings . we focus on isosceles triangle configurations , considering a squeezed limit in which primordial local ng contributions yield the largest signal @xcite . we now follow the convention of jeong and komatsu by setting @xmath89 : in other words , we consider isosceles triangles in momentum space . the squeezed limit , then , corresponds to configurations in which @xmath90 . the previous expressions ( [ bsmmm])-([bshhh ] ) become b_mmm&= & [ bsqmmmms ] , + b_hmm&=&\ { 4 + } + [ bsqhmmms ] , + b_hhm&= & \ { 2 + + & & + } [ bsqhhmms ] , + b_hhh&= & \ { 2 ^3 ( ) b_1 ( ) b_2(k)+ b_2 ( ) ( k)b_1(k ) } , [ bsqhhhms ] where we keep all contributions . these results , which use our generalized univariate approach , are similar to the ones obtained by @xcite using a bivariate approach : see appendix [ app : comparison ] for more details . expanding the previous functions , one finds at large scales @xmath21 and in squeezed limit @xmath90 , using @xmath91 and the approximation @xmath92 ,    b_mmm&&4 _ 0 ^ 2 _ 0 ^ 3 , + b_hmm&&4 _ 0 ^ 2 _ 0 ^ 3 b_g + , + b_hhm&&4 _ 0 ^ 2 _ 0 ^ 3 b_g^2 + , + & & + , + [ eq : bhhhk ] b_hhh&&4 _ 0 ^ 2 _ 0 ^ 3 b_g^3 + , + & & + , + & & + ( _ 2 + _ 3 ) ^2 . the expansion of the various expressions for the bispectra at large scales makes manifest how the non - gaussian parameters @xmath1 and @xmath0 characterize different bispectra , and suggests that the study of bispectra allows to distinguish the effects of each of them . indeed , several contributions appear with different scale dependences and different coefficients : these can be used to distinguish the effects of @xmath1 and @xmath0 .      here we discuss how our results allow one to break the degeneracy between @xmath0 and @xmath1 that affects the power spectra . we will discuss two possible methods to use bispectra to distinguish these two quantities . the previous results are obtained in the limit of large scales . we use this limit in order to allow simple analytical approximations for the transfer function @xmath15 and thus allow us to analytically understand physically interesting features of the bispectra as a function of the scale @xmath12 , for configurations of squeezed isosceles triangles in momentum space @xmath89 .    as a specific example , let us study in more detail the properties of @xmath93 , using the eq . ( [ eq : bhhhk ] ) valid at large scales . the aim is to determine distinctive signatures of @xmath0 in the profile of halo bispectra . ( [ eq : bhhhk ] ) has been written in a form aimed to emphasize the different scale dependences of the various contributions , it can also be expressed in a more concise form as [ bhhhz ] b_hhh=(3_2 + 2_0 b_gk^2 ) , which makes the zeroes of @xmath93 clearly identifiable . recall that the bispectrum ( [ bhhhz ] ) is defined for isosceles configurations in momentum space , in which the equal sides of the triangle have length @xmath12 , while the small side length @xmath94 . hence , we are studying @xmath93 as a function of the size of the long sides of an isosceles triangle in momentum space . in the limit of large @xmath95 , ( [ bhhhz ] ) has various roots : the ones that can be real are k_root^(1)&=&[kroot1 ] , + k_root^(2)&=&[kroot2 ] , hence the existence and positions of the zeroes of galaxy bispectrum depend on the values of the non - gaussian parameters @xmath1 and @xmath0 . working in regimes in which the parameters @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 are positive ( see the discussion in section [ sec : gnllss ] ) , the quantity @xmath99 is real only if @xmath100 and @xmath0 are both non - vanishing and have opposite signs . hence , if the profile of @xmath93 changes sign as a function of the scale , it would be a tantalizing hint of the presence of non - vanishing @xmath0 with an opposite sign to @xmath1 . while these roots have been derived in the limit of large scales where we can neglect the scale dependence of the transfer function , we will show that these features are accurately reproduced by a full numerical analysis in section [ sec : gnllss ] . the bispectrum @xmath93 is not the only quantity that allows to distinguish among different ng parameters . combining different bispectra , indeed , one can more directly probe the individual effects of @xmath1 with negligible contamination from @xmath0 . for example , let us consider the combination    [ intcomb ] c_fnl+3 -3 . making any approximation , using equations ( [ bsqmmmms])-([bsqhhhms ] ) one finds that the previous quantity reads , for isosceles triangles , [ dcfnl ] c_fnl = . hence it depends specifically on @xmath1 ( with only a minor dependence on @xmath0 in the denominator ) . hence , a measurement of non - vanishing @xmath101 would provide a very clean probe of the quantity @xmath1 that is ( almost ) independent on the size of @xmath0 . nevertheless , the combination @xmath101 is challenging to probe observationally , since it is harder to observe bispectra and power spectra involving dark matter densities ( although optimistically this might be realized in the future using gravitational lensing ) . the bottom - line of this section is that the bispectra of halos and matter have distinctive qualitative features that allow one to distinguish the effects of different non - gaussian parameters , thereby providing observables that may allow one to break the degeneracies between @xmath102 and @xmath103 that are present in the study of power spectra only . let us emphasize once more that the analytical results obtained so far include the effects of primordial ng only , without taking into account non - linear effects due to gravity . this approximation allowed us to analytically identify more directly the effects of different ng parameters in the halo distribution . a systematic analysis is needed to understand how much the features we pointed out survive when including the effects of gravity , and is left for future work . see however section [ sec : gnllss ] for a numerical study of our analytic results , with some preliminary discussion on possible effects of non - linear gravitational clustering . the next two sections are more theoretical , and investigate the implications of our findings when applied to the multiple source extension of our treatment . in this section , we discuss how to extend the previous analysis to the case of more than one source field for the primordial gravitational potential . we focus for definiteness on the case of two fields , that contribute to the gravitational potential as in the following ansatz [ mansatz ] & = & + + ( 1+)^2 ( ^2-^2)+(1+)^3 ( ^3 -3 ^2 ) , with = . while @xmath56 can be thought as the inflaton fluctuation , @xmath104 can be seen as a spectator field that is responsible for introducing ng of local form in the gravitational potential . the two fields @xmath56 and @xmath104 are by themselves gaussian : we split them as long and short mode with respect to a fiducial scale @xmath44 , as done in the previous section : & = & _ s+_l , + & = & _ s+_l . this set - up can be seen as an extension of the curvaton - like model analyzed in section of 4.1 of @xcite , where we include the contribution of @xmath0 . from now on , @xmath105 and @xmath106 . starting from ansatz ( [ mansatz ] ) , the three and four pt functions read ( k_1 ) ( k_2 ) ( k_3 ) & = & , + ( k_1 ) ( k_2 ) ( k_3 ) ( k_4 ) & = & 2(56 ) ^2 + , where = ( 65 ) ^2(1 + ) . the usual equality @xmath107 is recovered , as expected , in the single field limit @xmath108 . after implementing the long / short splitting , one gets in coordinate space & = & _ l+_l + ( 1+)^2 ( _ l^2-_l^2)+6 ( 1+)^3 ( _ l^3 -3 _ l^2_l ) + & & + _ s+ ( 1 + 2 ( 1+)^2 _ l + 3 ( 1+)^3(_l^2-_l^2 ) ) _ s + & & + ( 1+)^2 ( + 3(1+)_l ) ( _ s^2- [ _ s^2]_v ) + & & + ( 1+)^3 ( _ s^3 -3 [ _ s^2 ] _ s ) . the previous expression demonstrates how long wavelength modes modulate the gravitational potential . the coefficients of the different powers of @xmath59 and @xmath109 , which control the statistics of this quantity within the subvolume @xmath50 , receive contributions depending on the long mode @xmath110 , and thus acts as a background quantity from the point of view of the subvolume @xmath50 . in light of this , we can define the small scales effective power @xmath61_v^{1/2}$ ] , @xmath62 and @xmath63 as [ siges2 ] ( ^e ) & = & _ v^1/2 \ { 1 + 2 ( 1 + ) _ l + ( 1+)^2(2 ^ 2_l^2 + 3 ( _ l^2-_l^2 ) ) + & & + 12(1+)^3 ( -8 ^ 3_l^3 + 12 _ l ( _ l^2-_l^2 ) ) } , + ( 1+)^2 ^e&=&(1+)^2 ( + 3(1+)_l ) , + [ gnles2 ] ( 1+)^3 ^e&=&(1+)^3 , so we learn that long wavelength modes affect the two - point statistics of the short modes , as well as the non - gaussian parameters inside the small box .    following our treatment of the single source case , we can define the quantity @xmath70 corresponding to the linearly evolved sum of primordial gaussian perturbation as _ l= ( _ l+_l ) .    using the poisson equation , the long modes in the smoothed matter density contrast reads    ^(l)_m=_l+ . we express the halo density contrast as the expansion    _ + & & + ( -1 ) + ( ^e-)+ ( ^e- ) , with the standard bias evaluated at @xmath111 b_g= , and , moreover , we define at the same point _ 2&=&2 0.5cm,0.5cm_3=3 0.5cm,0.5cm_4=4 . substituting the formulae above , one finds [ eqn : deltah2 ] _ h&= & b_g _ l + 2_2 ( 1 + ) _ l + 6 _ 3 ( 1 + ) _ l + & & + + & & + + & = & b_g _ l+b_1_l+(b_2 _ l^2-b_3 _ l^2 ) + ( b_4_l^3 - 3 b_5 _ we define the bias @xmath74 as [ mb1 ] b_1 & & b_g + _ 2 ( 1 + ) + _ 3 ( 1 + ) , + [ mb2 ] b_2 & & ( 1+)^2 , + b_3 & & ( 1+)^2 , + b_4 & & ( 1+)^3 , + b_5 & & ( 1+)^3 . we adopt the following definitions for the two point functions ( the same as in the single source case we discussed in previous sections ) p_mm(2)^3(+)&=&_m _ m , + p_hm(2)^3(+)&= & , + p_hh(2)^3(+)&=&_h _ h , where p_mm&=&= , + p_hm&=&= , + p_hh&=&= .      the three point functions are defined as b_mmm(2)^3(_1+_2+_3)&=&_m _ m _ m , + b_hmm(2)^3(_1+_2+_3)&= & , + b_hhm(2)^3(_1+_2+_3)&= & , + b_hhh(2)^3(_1+_2+_3)&=&_h _ h _ h ,    obtaining    b_mmm&=&2 ( 1+)^2_0 ^ 2 ^(1)^(2 ) ^(3)(++)[bmmmm ] , + b_hmm&=&\{_0 ^ 2^(2)^(3)+}[bmhmm ] , + b_hhm&=&\{_0 ^ 2^(3)+}[bmhhm ] , + b_hhh&=&_0 ^ 2(b_2^(1)+b_2^(2)+b_2^(3))[bmhhh ] , where @xmath84 and @xmath85 . in the previous formulae , we focussed only on tree - level contributions , neglecting loop effects . remarkably , only the bias parameter @xmath75 and @xmath77 appear . we now set @xmath89 . that is , we consider isosceles triangles . the squeezed limit , then , corresponds to configurations in which @xmath90 . the previous expressions ( [ bmmmm])-([bmhhh ] ) become b_mmm&= & [ bsqmmm ] , + b_hmm&=&\ { 4 ( 1+)^2 + + & & + } [ bmsqhmm ] , + b_hhm&= & \ { 2 ( 1+)^2 + + & & + } [ bmsqhhm ] , + b_hhh&= & \ { 2 ^3 ( k/)b_1 ( ) b_2(k)+ b_2 ( ) ( k)b_1(k ) } , [ bmsqhhh ] where we keep all contributions . notice that the structure of the bispectra is very similar to the case of single source , apart from coefficients depending on @xmath112 , the ratio of the power spectra of the gaussian fields . this implies that when expanded using eqs . ( [ mb1],[mb2 ] ) , one finds various contributions depending both on bispectrum ( @xmath1 ) and trispectrum ( @xmath4 and @xmath0 ) parameters . the qualitative features of the bispectra as a function of the scale remain the same as the ones discussed in the single source case . for example , let us write the multi - source version of the quantity @xmath101 that we wrote in eq . ( [ dcfnl ] ) : it reads c_fnl = . also in the multiple source case , this quantity represents a clean probe of the ng parameter @xmath1 ( almost ) independent from the value of @xmath0 .    in the next section , we investigate the contributions depending on @xmath112 that play an important role in defining the properties of the stochastic halo bias . stochastic halo bias arises when halo overdensities are not fully correlated with matter overdensities @xcite . an example is the inequality @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the halo - matter bias . as we have seen , halo and matter overdensities depend on primordial ng : neglecting the effect of shot - noise , the aforementioned stochasticity is associated with inequalities between non - gaussian parameters . such inequalities have been well studied in the analysis of ng from inflation , and are typically ( but not only @xcite ) associated with the presence of multiple sources for the primordial gravitational potential . a famous inequality is the suyama - yamaguchi inequality @xmath115 . in this section , we will investigate the role of @xmath0 for characterizing the stochasticity of halo bias , and we will extend the notion of stochasticity to the bispectra . we will make use of some technical results on inequalities among primordial non - gaussian parameters , which we relegate to appendix [ app : ine ] . in this section , as in the previous ones , we will not include loop effects . a convenient quantity to quantify the stochasticity of halo bias using power spectra is @xmath116 , defined as @xcite r_p=- ( ) ^2 . using the results of section [ sec : npoint ] , we find at large scales @xmath117 [ psin ] r_p=0 . hence @xmath118 , and the equality @xmath119 can be obtained when ng is absent , or in the single field limit @xmath120 . notice that @xmath1 and @xmath0 appear in a combination that renders the identification of their individual effects difficult  a feature that we already discussed by studying power spectra in the previous sections . let us provide a heuristic understanding for this result , extending the arguments of @xcite to include @xmath0 . in that paper , setting @xmath121 , the inequality @xmath122 was associated to the suyama - yamaguchi inequality @xmath123 . on the other hand , when including @xmath0 , we learn that eq . ( [ psin ] ) reads [ psin2 ] _ 0k^4 r_p=()^2 + 2_2_3+_3 ^ 20 . hence we find two additional terms proportional to @xmath0 besides the first corresponding to the suyama - yamaguchi inequality . as we have seen in the previous sections , the halo displacement can be schematically expressed as an expansion in terms of local correlation functions of the linearly evolved matter density field _ h = b_g + _ 2 [ ^2]+_3 [ ^3]+  using this expansion , we can schematically express the quantity @xmath116 as r_p&= & - + & = & _ 2 ^ 2(- ) + 2 _ 2 _ 3 ( - ) + _ 3 ^ 2 ( - ) [ exprp ] . to write the previous formula , we used the schematic notation discussed in appendix [ app : ine ] to express squeezed and collapsed limits of @xmath2-pt functions . with @xmath124\rangle$ ] we denote the squeezed configuration of a 3-pt function , in which one of the momenta is sent to zero : this notation clearly demonstrates that a long mode @xmath14 modulates the 2-pt function @xmath125 $ ] . with @xmath126\ , [ \delta^2]\rangle$ ] we denote the collapsed configuration of a 4-pt function , in which the momentum connecting the two @xmath127 $ ] is going to zero .    the combination in the first term in the rhs of equation ( [ exprp ] ) relates the collapsed limit of a four point function with the squeezed limit of the three point function , and is associated with the suyama - yamaguchi inequality ( see eq . ( [ nongi1b ] ) ) . it corresponds to the first term in ( [ psin2 ] ) . the remaining terms are instead associated to the inequalities ( [ nongi2 ] ) , ( [ nongi3 ] ) , that involve collapsed limits of higher point functions , and are at the origin of the additional contributions in ( [ psin2 ] ) depending on @xmath0 . the conclusion is that @xmath122 does not measure just the sy inequality , but a combination of contributions associated with various inequalities : thus , it can not clearly distinguish between @xmath1 and @xmath0 . stochasticity can be defined also using bispectra : this allows one to break the degeneracy between @xmath1 and @xmath0 also at the level of stochastic halo bias . consider the bispectra defined for isosceles triangles , both for the case of single and multiple sources as discussed in the previous sections . ( squeezed configurations are special cases in which one of the sides of the triangle has vanishing size , i.e. the parameter @xmath95 defined in section [ sec : isomulti ] is large ) . we define the following quantity @xmath128 that uses bispectra to measure stochasticity    r_b= + - - . a non - vanishing @xmath128 is associated with stochasticity : indeed , using the same arguments of the previous subsection , one can expand the previous quantity @xmath128 in terms of @xmath73 , @xmath1 and @xmath0 finding a sum of several contributions that vanish in the single source limit . these contributions , among other things , depend on appropriated collapsed limits of six point functions ; an example of contributions to @xmath128 is the following combination , which appears in the expansion for @xmath128 multiplied by suitable powers of the available parameters    . using the inequalities among non - gaussian parameters discussed in appendix [ app : ine ] , one can check that @xmath129 vanishes in the single source case ( neglecting loop effects ) , while it is generally non - vanishing for multiple sources . for the specific two - field model of section [ sec : npoint ] , neglecting loop corrections , one can straightforwardly check that @xmath128 is non - vanishing only when @xmath130 , i.e. in presence of multiple sources . we find the following value for @xmath128 at large scales and in the limit of squeezed configurations @xmath90 r_b= - + o(k^4 ) . hence , at very large scales @xmath17 , @xmath128 is sensitive to @xmath1 and its sign : if @xmath1 vanishes , then @xmath128 vanishes no matter of the size of @xmath0 . hence @xmath128 can be an useful complementary observable besides @xmath116 to study the stochasticity of halo bias . the analytical results of the previous sections indicate that the effects of @xmath1 and @xmath0 can be distinguished by measuring bispectra of halo and matter densities , in a way that is not possible by studying power spectra only . indeed , in the scale - dependent bias of the halo power spectrum the parameters @xmath1 and @xmath0 are weighted by the same power of the scale @xmath12 , while the bispectra contain different contributions depending on non - gaussian parameters that scale with different powers of @xmath12 , implying it is possible to overcome the degeneracy between @xmath1 and @xmath0 without having to study galaxy @xmath131-point functions . we theoretically analyzed this subject in the previous sections , making simplifying assumptions aimed to concentrate on the effects of primordial ng on the halo bias . while in our theoretical discussions , in order to obtain analytic expressions for our quantities , we focussed on the limit of large scales where simple approximations for the transfer functions hold , in this section we numerically investigate the features of the bispectrum also for smaller scales , in order to determine properties of this quantity that allow us to distinguish the effects of @xmath0 from the ones of @xmath1 . in particular , we investigate two properties of halo and matter bispectra that we found when analytically studying them in the previous theoretical sections : 1 ) the dependence on @xmath0 of the sign of halo bispectra as a function of the scale . and 2 ) the fact that a particular combination of halo and matter bispectra , @xmath101 ( see eq . ( [ dcfnl ] ) ) depends on @xmath1 only , allowing one to cleanly distinguish @xmath1 from @xmath0 .    to start with , we focus on the single source case and investigate the slope of the halo bispectrum @xmath93 associated with squeezed isosceles triangles in momentum space . we consider highly biased halos for all the possible combinations of @xmath132 and @xmath133 , in the squeezed configuration @xmath134 ( that is , the ratio between the long and short sides of an isosceles triangle in momentum space is 100 ) . the aim of our analysis is to confirm the analytical results we determined in the previous sections , and to investigate at which scales , redshifts and masses a distinct signature of the effects of @xmath0 might be observed by future surveys , like euclid @xcite . on the other hand , our analysis intends to concentrate on the effects of primordial ng , without including the non - linear evolution of gravity , nor non - linearities associated with the particular dependence of the mass function on the matter density contast . these contributions will be addressed in a future publication . the starting point of our arguments is eq . for @xmath93 . in order to obtain the quantities @xmath75 , @xmath77 defined in eqs . , , we compute @xmath135 by using the transfer function from camb @xcite with the state parameters consistent with the wmap@xmath136bao@xmath137sn cosmology @xcite ( the reason of this choice will be clear later ) . then , to evaluate the bias coefficients @xmath98 , @xmath97 , @xmath138 defined in eqs . , , a specific mass function must be chosen at the expense of making additional assumptions . the mass function gives the number density of halos at a given redshift @xmath19 with mass within @xmath26 and @xmath139 ; under the assumption of universality , the mass function depends only on @xmath140 . it takes the form @xcite [ expnh ] n_h(m , z)= f ( ) , where the variance @xmath141 of the smoothed linear density contrast @xmath36 is given by _ m(z)^2w_m^2(k)|^2(k , z)p_(k ) and we replace the spherical collapse threshold @xmath142 with @xmath143 , to improve the agreement between the barrier model and simulations @xcite . when the primordial gravitational potential is exactly gaussian , the mass function @xmath144 appearing in ( [ expnh ] ) assumes the press - schechter form [ psdis ] f_ps()=e^- .    for non - gaussian primordial fluctuations , @xmath145 must be replaced by a more accurate mass function . several mass functions that account for non - gaussian initial conditions have been proposed in the literature ( see for example @xcite and the reviews @xcite ) . for our analysis , we will adopt the results of smith , ferraro , and loverde @xcite , based on the edgeworth expansion ; these provide a useful , theoretically motivated expression for halo bias which agrees with @xmath11-body simulations . the edgeworth expansion can be applied within the barrier crossing model by building up the pdf as a series of higher - order cumulants ( defined as @xmath146 ) times the press - schechter gaussian distribution ( [ psdis ] ) . in order to have a positive definite distribution , it is important to specify the order of the cumulant at which the series is truncated ( see @xcite for further details , and also @xcite for additional papers that include the effects of kurtosis ) . fortunately , for the weakly ng regime we are interested in , the edgeworth expansion converges rapidly , providing a useful approximation as long as @xmath147 . within this regime , the edgeworth expansion corresponds simply the press - schechter mass function plus first - order corrections in @xmath1 and @xmath0 :    [ eq : edgeworth ] n(m)= , where @xmath148 is @xmath2-th hermite polynomial and we defined the @xmath2-th ng cumulant    _ 3(m)&=_3^(1)(m)(6.610 ^ -4)[eq : kappa_3 ] , + _ 4(m)&=_4^(1)(m)(1.610 ^ -7)[eq : kappa_4 ] . the approximated results above are taken from @xcite .    under these approximations universality is recovered , and within the validity of the edgeworth expansion , the bias coefficients are obtained by taking the derivatives of eq .. decomposing b_g = b_g0+b_0+b_0 , we have b_g0&=&1 + [ eq : bg0 ] , + b_0&=&-^(1)_3(m)()- ( ) , + b_0&=&-^(1)_4(m)()- ( ) . moreover , _ 2&=&2 ^ 2 - 2 [ eq : beta2 ] , + _ 3&=&^(1)_3(m)()- ( ) [ eq : beta3 ] . the physical interpretation of the results above is the following : @xmath149 is the usual gaussian bias in eulerian coordinates , while the terms @xmath150 and @xmath151 describe the scale - independent shift to @xmath152 . unfortunately they can not be used to constrain primordial ng , since the bias of a real tracer population is not known a priori . then , @xmath97 is the well - known scale - dependent bias for an @xmath1 cosmology . by neglecting the explicit mass dependence of the edgeworth expansion , we have forced eq . to satisfy the relation @xmath153 found in @xcite ; this is valid for a universal mass function . finally , @xmath138 describes the scale - dependent bias introduced by the @xmath0 parameter . recall that the mass function here is initially computed in lagrangian coordinates , therefore the @xmath154 in eq . takes into account the dynamical effects produced by linear gravity and bring us to eulerian coordinates @xcite . let us emphasize again that here we are only including the linear effects of gravity . non - linear effects would add further non - gaussian features to bispectra  not specifically due uniquely to primordial ng , the focus of this paper  that we intend to analyze in a future publication . smith et al . compared the edgeworth prediction for @xmath138 with @xmath11-body simulations , finding that it breaks down at lower halo mass , @xmath155 . to fix this problem , they first noted that eq . can be written as _ 3=_3- ( ) , then , they found a good agreement with simulations by changing the coefficients of the polynomial in the brackets as follows [ eq : beta3ast ] _ 3^=_3- ( ) . our numerical analysis can be easily performed by using the following fitting functions @xcite _ 3&=&0.000329(1 + 0.09 z ) b_g0 ^ -0.09[eq : kappa_32 ] , + & = & -0.000061(1 + 0.22 z ) b_g0 ^ -0.25[eq : dkappa_3 ] . the quantities - , provide the necessary terms to describe highly biased tracers . all the results provided by smith et al . have been tested against @xmath131 simulations with gaussian initial conditions , @xmath156 simulations with @xmath157 and @xmath158 simulations with @xmath159 , for a total of @xmath160 simulations in the wmap@xmath136bao@xmath137sn cosmology . given that these results have been well tested on several simulations , we assume the same dataset , and we do not expect to see any radical change in our order - of - magnitude analysis for a slightly different @xmath161cdm cosmology . however , further simulations should be carried out to test the validity of @xmath162 for the low values of @xmath1 and @xmath0 we are interested in . let us now present our numerical results and their interpretation . 1 displays the absolute value of the halo bispectrum ( using a @xmath163-scaling ) , for halos of mass @xmath164 , at redshift @xmath165 , and @xmath12-space triangles with squeezing parameter @xmath134 . each of the three plots in this figure shows the results for a different value of @xmath1 : @xmath166 for case 1 , @xmath167 for case 2 , and @xmath168 for case 3 . the lines on each plot correspond to different values of @xmath0 . each point on the @xmath12-axis actually involves three different values of the wavenumber specifying the three sides of a squeezed triangle in momentum space : two at @xmath169 ( the long equal sides ) and one at @xmath170 ( the small side ) . the plots span an interval of @xmath12 between @xmath171 and @xmath172 , corresponding to scales within ranges that will be probed by future observations made by euclid , under the hypothesis that this survey will gain one order of magnitude in scale with respect to boss @xcite . since negative values of the bispectrum are possible , we plot the absolute value of @xmath93 . the presence of cusps indicate the changing from positive to negative values ( or vice - versa ) . for the sake of clarity , we use dashed lines for negative values of the bispectrum and solid lines for positive ones . [ fig : first ]     +     + _ top _ : the absolute value of the halo bispectrum @xmath93 in the squeezed configuration @xmath173 , for halo mass @xmath164 , redshift @xmath165 , @xmath166 . different lines correspond to the values @xmath174 . we use solid lines to describe positive values and dotted lines for neagative values ; the presence of a cusp indicates a change of sign . the pattern of zeros in the plotted range of wavenumbers can be used to distinguish @xmath1 from @xmath0 : see the text for further details . + _ bottom left _ : same as the top panel , but for @xmath167 . for @xmath175 a zero is present . + _ bottom right _ : same as top panel , but for @xmath168 . notice that a single zero appears , for @xmath176 . an inspection of these plots suggests an important qualitative feature of these results . if the parameters are contained within appropriate intervals , the halo bispectrum as a function of @xmath12 changes sign more times if @xmath0 has opposite sign with respect to @xmath1 . for example , in fig . 1 , case 1 corresponding to @xmath166 , we see that the green curve , corresponding to the logarithm of the bispectrum for @xmath177 , changes sign twice instead of once as the other curves . moreover , the positions of the zero at smaller scales , that exists for all the curves , depends on the value of @xmath0 . in fig . 1 , case 2 with @xmath167 , the bispectra for different values of @xmath0 never change sign in the interval of scales we consider . finally , in fig . 1 , case 3 with @xmath178 , the red curve with @xmath179 changes sign while all the other curves do not . the qualitative features in the bispectra profiles as a function of scale become even more pronounced when considering higher redshifts or higher mass objects . to show this behaviour , we present plots displaying the halo bispectrum for two additional cases . the first set , displayed in fig . 2 , is for @xmath164 , @xmath180 , @xmath134 , while the second one is for @xmath181 , @xmath165 , @xmath134 and is displayed in fig . each plot uses the same conventions as fig . the qualitative considerations we made above are still valid . in particular , we see , at higher mass or redshift than our fiducial choice ( @xmath164 , @xmath165 , @xmath134 ) , an increase in the absolute value of the halo bispectrum . interestingly , the various contributions to the bispectrum weighted by different powers of @xmath12 make the magenta curve for @xmath175 in the plots with @xmath178 change sign , in both cases presented here . this new feature is due to the dependence of the bias parameters @xmath75 , @xmath77 on mass and redshift . [ fig : first2 ]     + same as fig . 1 , but for @xmath182 . the amplitude of the bispectra have increased considerably over the case with @xmath183 ( shown in fig . 1 ) , the positions of the zeros have changed for @xmath184 ( top panel , and the number of zeros has increased for @xmath185 ( bottom right panel ) .    [ fig : first3 ]     + same as fig . 1 , but for @xmath180 . the amplitude of the bispectra have increased significantly over the case of @xmath165 ( shown in fig . 1 ) and the positions of the zeros differ from those observed both in fig . 1 and fig . 2 .    hence , the previous plots show that the presence or absence of @xmath0 affects the bispectra profiles : in particular it governs how many times the halo bispectrum changes sign as a function of the scale . we already discussed this qualitative behavior in section [ subsec : squeezed ] , when analytically studying the roots of the bispectrum in the large scale limit . the numerical results of this section confirm those analytical findings , indicating that the qualitative profile of the halo bispectrum for isosceles triangles as a function of the scale can provide an interesting signature of the presence of @xmath0 . hence , we learn that the fact that the bispectrum changes sign in multiple locations as a function of the scale is a distinctive signal of the presence of @xmath0 . optimistically , this can be used to constraint values of @xmath0 smaller than the ones that can be tested by cmb . these features might be observed in cases in which large values of @xmath98 are realized , since in this case the bispectrum generated by primordial ng is more significant . thus , the bispectrum is greater for larger halo masses @xmath26 and , at constant @xmath26 , greater at higher redshift . for example , in fig . 4 we provide an example of halos at redshift @xmath180 , for @xmath166 . in this case , we see that the green curve corresponding to the halo bispectrum changes sign twice for @xmath186 . an observation of this phenomenon can then probe quite small values for @xmath0 . we can also compare the results of fig . 4 with the analytical formulae for the zeros of the bispectrum , eqs ( [ kroot1 ] ) and ( [ kroot2 ] ) . for the halo mass , redshift and @xmath95 parameter we are considering , we find @xmath187 , @xmath188 , @xmath189 . computing the positions of the zeros of the bispectrum for the case @xmath186 with the analytical formulae of eqs ( [ kroot1 ] ) and ( [ kroot2 ] ) , one finds the zeros at @xmath190 and @xmath191 h / mpc , in agreement with the numerical results within one order of magnitude . this implies that our analytical findings , although obtained in the approximation in which we neglect the scale dependence of the transfer function , provide reasonably accurate predictions for the positions of the zeroes .     + the plot shows the absolute value of the halo bispectrum @xmath93 in the squeezed configuration @xmath173 , for halo mass @xmath164 and redshift @xmath180 . @xmath1 is kept constant and equal to @xmath192 , while different lines correspond to the values @xmath193 . we use solid lines to describe positive values and dotted lines for negative values ; the presence of a cusp indicate a change of sign . @xmath166 produces a specific pattern of zeros in the line with @xmath186 . if this feature can be observed in the halo bispectrum , it will improve the constrain on @xmath0 to few hundreds . [ fig : fourth ]    we now present a plot that represents the second theoretical observation we made in the previous sections : if it is possible to probe and observe bispectra correlating halo and matter densities ( for example using gravitational lensing ) then by analyzing combinations such as @xmath101 of eq . ( [ dcfnl ] ) we can have clean measurements of @xmath1 only , with a negligible contamination of @xmath0 . in fig . 5 we represent this quantity for different values of @xmath1 , halo masses and redshifts ; the lines are practically insensitive on @xmath0 , and depend only on @xmath1 and on the halo mass . this feature , as we discussed around eq . ( [ dcfnl ] ) , is valid at all scales ( although at smaller scales one should take into more proper account the non - linear effects of gravity ) . this concretely shows that an observation of a non - vanishing value for the quantity @xmath101 would be a clean indication of a non - vanishing @xmath1 . combined with other measurements ( for example associated with power spectra ) this fact could then be used to obtain independent constraints on @xmath0 . + the plot shows the quantity @xmath101 in the squeezed configuration @xmath173 , for different halo masses ( @xmath194 ) and redshifts ( @xmath195 ) . @xmath101 is positive for @xmath178 and negative for @xmath166 . remarkably , the lines are insensitive to the values of @xmath0 .    [ fig : five ]    we conclude that the scale dependence of bispectra of isosceles configurations in momentum space have qualitative features that might allow us to distinguish the effects of different ng parameters , in a way that is not possible by studying power spectra only .    while in the previous discussion we neglected the effects of non - linear gravity in the results for the bispectra , let us end this section with a preliminary analysis of its contributions . focussing on squeezed configurations , the next plot shows a comparison between the amplitude of bispectra associated with primordial ng only ( color lines ) and bispectra due uniquely to the non - linear effects of gravity ( black lines ) . we divide the bispectrum due to gravity in two contributions . the black dotted line corresponds to the amplitude of bispectra associated only with linear bias @xmath152 , and is controlled by the so - called @xmath196 function . this corresponds to the three point function for first order fluctuations . the black continuous line , instead , is the contribution associated with the quadratic coefficient as @xmath197 , although in the literature it is usually referred to as @xmath77 . ] @xmath197 of the local nonlinear biasing model of @xcite . we make the choice @xmath198 in order to be more conservative respect to @xcite ( see the review @xcite for more details . )     + the plot shows the amplitude of halo bispectra as a function of scale . the colored lines are bispectra associated with primordial ng only ; the black lines are contributions to bispectra due to non - linear gravitational clustering . the black dotted line corresponds to the gravitational clustering contributions to @xmath93 depending on the linear bias @xmath152 only . the continuous line is the gravity bispectrum associated with non - linear bias @xmath77 ( we take @xmath199 ) . [ fig : six ]    we notice that the amplitude of the bispectrum due to primordial ng tends to dominate at large scales ( small @xmath12 ) . however , if the primordial ng parameters are chosen to be small , the bispectrum induced by gravity is more important at smaller scales ( see green line ) . for somewhat larger values of the ng parameters ( with the magnitude of @xmath0 still below cmb constraints ) the amplitude of the primordial bispectrum can dominate over the gravity contributions also at relatively small scales ( see violet line ) . the primordial bispectrum represented in the violet line has non - trivial profile due to competing effects of primordial @xmath1 and @xmath0 , in particular it has zeroes associated with the presence of @xmath0 : if such features can be detected in the bispectrum profile , they can be used to help distinguishing among the effects of @xmath1 and @xmath0 . the plot above is only indicative , in the sense that one should study in more detail the _ combined _ effects of non - linear gravity and primordial ng in shaping the bispectra , and not only comparing their relative amplitude . on the other hand , it gives the idea that for interesting values of ng parameters the primordial contribution can lead to a rich profile for the bispectrum , controlled by the primordial ng parameters , with an amplitude larger or comparable to the one due to gravitational clustering only . primordial ng characterizes the interactions of the fields sourcing the density fluctuations that seed the large - scale structure of our universe . in this work , using a generalized univariate approach that we compared with other methods in the literature , we analytically and numerically investigated how the statistics of lss , in particular the study of bispectra of halos and matter , allow one to probe primordial ng . our aim was to find ways to determine distinctive features of the local non - gaussian parameters @xmath1 and @xmath0 , controlling respectively skewness and kurtosis of the probability distribution function , and whose effects in the halo and matter power spectra are nearly degenerate . this investigation is important since although cmb constraints on @xmath1 have greatly improved with planck , it is not clear whether cmb measurements only can set stringent constraints on @xmath0 .    in the first part of this work , we showed analytically that the profiles of halo and matter bispectra have qualitative features that if measurable would clearly distinguish the effects of each non - gaussian parameter . we exploited the scale dependence of the halo bias induced by primordial ng . we worked in a simplified situation in which only linear bias and linear effects of gravitational clustering are taken into account , to single out the effects of primordial ng in the statistics of lss . we have shown that the profile of the halo bispectrum as a function of the scale , for isosceles configurations of triangles in momentum space , has properties that provide simple , qualitative information on each non - gaussian parameter . for example , the number and the position of the zeros of this function depend on the size of @xmath0 , and can be analytically computed with our formulae . if @xmath0 is present , and its sign is opposite with respect to the sign of @xmath1 , the number of zeros of the bispectra increases as a function of the scale . then , we determined a particular combination of halo and matter bispectra and power spectra , denoted @xmath101 , that is proportional to @xmath1 only and is ( nearly ) independent on the value of @xmath0 . a detection of this combination would be a clean probe of @xmath1 with no contaminations associated with @xmath0 . we then generalized our findings to the case in which multiple sources contribute to form the primordial density fluctuations , and studied how stochastic halo bias is affected by the presence of @xmath0 . we also provided new ways to study stochastic halo bias in terms of combinations of bispectra and power spectra .    in the second part of this work , we numerically confirmed and further developed our analytical results , focussing on a press - schechter approach to halo formation supplemented by appropriate non - gaussian initial conditions . this analysis allowed us to apply our theoretical formulae for the bispectra focussing on scales and redshifts that might be probed by future surveys . we confirmed our theoretical considerations , showing plots representing how the qualitative profiles of halo bispectra in suitable configurations depend on non - gaussian parameters , and might be used to set constraints on them . we ended our discussion with a preliminary analysis of the contributions of non - linear gravitational clustering , indicating that non - linear gravity tends to contaminate the bispectrum profiles , but that the qualitative features we investigated survive for sufficiently large primordial non - gaussian parameters . our results can be extended in various directions . from the theoretical side , the non - linear effects associated with features of the mass function , bias and gravitational clustering ( the non - linear transformation from lagrangian to eulerian coordinates ) , as well as loop effects , should be properly included in the context of perturbation theory , in order to understand whether and how primordial ng controls the qualitative features of bispectra also after taking these non - linearities into account . having a good control of gravitational effects would also allow one to reliably study the bispectra for smaller values of the scale and for configurations that are less squeezed than the ones we considered here , and extend the validity of our results in these regimes . we plan to explore this interesting issue in a future publication . another direction of investigation is a more systematic study of observational applications of our results , trying to quantify whether the methods we propose are sufficiently efficient to set constraints on @xmath0 that are more stringent than those available from the cmb . an important extension of our work is thus to forecast the signal - to - noise of galaxy bispectra as a function of scale , for future surveys such as euclid , and thereby test whether the features we predict are observable . such study will exploit our theoretical inputs to develop optimised methods to distinguish the effects of @xmath1 and @xmath0 using galaxy bispectra and thus quantify their size and sign independently . we thank tommaso giannantonio and kazuya koyama for useful discussions . gt is supported by an stfc advanced fellowship st / h005498/1 . dw is supported by stfc grant st / k00090x/1 . gt and dw thank the participants of the workshop  constraining the early universe in the post planck era "" , funded by the royal society , for useful feedback on this work . in this appendix , we compare our results with the ones obtained in two previous papers that studied galaxy bispectra . we start discussing a comparison with the paper of jeong and komatsu @xcite . jeong and komatsu were the first to investigate the halo bispectrum up to the ng parameter @xmath0 including the scale dependence of bias . it is important to point out the connection between their results and our findings . we address the issue in this appendix . first of all , let us briefly sketch the formalism used in @xcite . they assume that the halo density contrast can be expressed as a local bias expansion of the matter overdensity in eulerian coordinates , whose fourier transform is    _ @xmath200 , while @xmath201 is the @xmath2-th order quantity of the linear density contrast , given by perturbation theory @xcite . the advantage of this approach is that non - linear evolution is automatically included when building the @xmath158-point function , even though calculations become harder .    on the other hand , the assumptions that led us to the halo density contrast of eq . are somewhat different . as we will show , the peak - background split method within a barrier crossing approach allows to re - obtain part of the results of @xcite in a simple way ( at least in the squeezed limit ) and extend them up to higher powers of ng parameters . however , since we have not yet accounted for the non - linear effects of gravity , a comparison is possible only between primordial ng effects at this stage . moreover , it is known ( see for example @xcite ) that the local lagrangian and eulerian bias are not compatible in non - linear regimes .    by plugging eqs . , , into eq . and collecting all the terms proportional to the same ng parameter , we find :    b_hhh^&=&_0 ^ 2 b_g^3 ( k_1 ^ 3+k_2 ^ 3+k_3 ^ 3)4_0 ^ 2 b_g^3 ^ 3_0 , +   + b_hhh^^2&=&^2_0 ^ 2 b_g^2 _ 2 4 ^ 2_0 ^ 2 b_g^2 _ 2_0 ^ 2 , +   + b_hhh^&=&_0 ^ 2 b_g^2 _ 2 ( + + ) 6_0 ^ 2 b_g^2 _ 2_0 ^ 2 , where the approximated results are obtained by using @xmath91 and @xmath92 , in the squeezed configuration @xmath202 with large @xmath95 . the term @xmath203 is the same primordial ng contribution found in @xcite , while the approximated results for @xmath204 and @xmath205 match respectively those of eq.@xmath206 and eq.@xmath207 of @xcite on large scales . however , a subtle difference between our results and those of @xcite arise , due to the different initial assumptions . the matching is truly correct only if the equalities @xmath208 , @xmath209 hold : it would be interesting to understand the physical meaning of this fact . some interesting consideration follow from the ratios of the previous quantities : & = & , +   + & = & _ 0 k^2 , +   + & = & ^2 . it is clear from the first ratio that the @xmath210 term can dominate over the @xmath1 one in the squeezed limit , as pointed out in @xcite . moreover , the bispectrum distinguishes between @xmath205 and @xmath203 ( second ratio ) but , surprisingly , the @xmath0 term shows the same scaling as the @xmath210 one .    at this point , all the primordial ng contributions found in @xcite have been recovered but new terms come out from eq .. we collect them explicitly here :    b_hhh^^3&=&^3 _ 0 ^ 2 b_g _ 2 ^ 2 ( + + ) 4 ^3 _ 0 ^ 2 b_g _ 2 ^ 2 _ 0 , +   + b_hhh^&=&_0 ^ 2 b_g\{b_g_3+_2 ^ 2 } + & & 2_0 ^ 2 b_g^3(2 + 3 ) , +   + b_hhh^^2&=&^2_0 ^ 2 b_g_2_3(++)6 ^ 2_0 ^ 2 b_g_2_3_0 , +   + b_hhh^^2&=&^2_0 ^ 2 + & & 2 ^ 2_0 ^ 2 ^ 3(4 + 3 ) , +   + b_hhh^^2&=&^2_0 ^ 2 + & & 4 ^ 2_0 ^ 2 ^ 3(+3 ) , +   + b_hhh^^3&=&^3 _ 0 ^ 2 _ 2 _ 3 ^ 2 ( + + ) 6 ^ 3 _ 0 ^ 2 _ 2 _ 3 ^ 2 . these additional terms appear naturally within our framework and suggest that higher powers of ng parameters can in principle dominate over the lower ones , extending what jeong and komatsu found for the ratio @xmath211 . all the contributions above are important for the specific features of the halo bispectrum discussed in section [ sec : gnllss ] . let us now compare our approach with the one by baldauf et al in @xcite . the easiest way to proceed is to reconsider our equation ( [ coldh ] ) : by substituting our results for the bias coefficients @xmath74 ( see eqs ( [ eq : b1])-([eq : b3 ] ) ) , and using the relation @xmath212 , we can schematically write our expression for @xmath53 as an expansion [ bivarus ] _ h = b_g_l+_2_l + _ 3 _ l+b_g_l _ l+32_2_l^2 + b_g _ l_l^2 , where to render the expression more compact , we understand the subtraction of the averages contained in ( [ coldh ] ) . this ` bivariate ' way of re - express our formula for the halo bias makes clear the connection with the bivariate approach of @xcite , in which the lagrangian halo bias is expanded in powers of @xmath70 and @xmath60 : [ bivar ] _ h = b_10 _ l+b_01 _ l+ _ l^2 + _ l^2+b_11_l_l+  , where the bias coefficient @xmath213 is defined as b_ij=()|__l=0 , _ l=0 . the values we find for the @xmath213 coefficients are obtained by comparing eqs . ( [ bivarus ] ) with ( [ bivar ] ) corresponds to our @xmath214 . ] : b_10&=&b_g + [ eqb01 ] b_01&=&_2 + _ 3 + b_11&=&b_g + b_02&=&3 _ 2 + b_20&=&0 they differ from the ones of @xcite for two reasons . the first reason is that , as explained in the main text , in our approach we decided to perform a taylor expansion at _ linear order _ in @xmath14 and on all its correlation functions in langrangian space . in this way we consider only non - linear effects induced by primordial ng , and we exclude non - linearities associated with higher derivatives of the mass function . this approximation is also justified by the fact that higher derivatives of the mass function along non - gaussian parameters are under less reliable theoretical control . the second reason is that we include also the effects of ( first ) derivatives of the mass function along @xmath1 ( that provide contributions proportional to @xmath138 ) that are instead neglected in a bivariate approach . hence , for example , the coefficient @xmath215 in eq ( [ eqb01 ] ) , using our definition of @xmath97 , @xmath138 reads b_01&=&+while the first term can be associated with the analogous result reported in @xcite , the second term is absent in their case . indeed , the bivariate approach produces the @xmath216 dependence in the bias of the halo - halo and halo - matter power spectra as a contribution from the trispectrum @xcite . on the other hand , our expression for @xmath217 is vanishing because we decided not to consider the second derivatives of @xmath35 along @xmath70 . for the same reason of not considering such second derivatives , various contributions in the remaining coefficients @xmath213 proportional to @xmath210 , found in @xcite are absent in our formulae . in this appendix we collect some technical results on inequalities among primordial non - gaussian parameters , that we use in section [ sec : stochastic ] . the most famous of these inequalities is dubbed suyama - yamaguchi inequality , and relates the collapsed limit of the 4-pt function with the square of the squeezed limit of a 3-pt function of a given fluctuation @xmath14 in fourier space @xcite [ nongi1 ] _ q0_k_1 _ -k_1-q _ k_2 _ -k_2+q  _ q0 using the definitions for @xmath4 and @xmath1 and specializing to the case of primordial curvature fluctuations , this inequality corresponds to the suyama - yamaguchi inequality . it is convenient to simplify the notation , expressing the squeezed limit of the 3-pt function in ( [ nongi1 ] ) in a synthetic way as @xmath124\rangle$ ] , meaning that the momentum @xmath218 connecting @xmath219 and @xmath127 $ ] is sent to zero : this notation emphasizes that the long mode @xmath220 with @xmath221 modulates the 2-pt function @xmath127 $ ] . analogously , the collapsed limit of the 4-pt function can be expressed as @xmath222   [ \delta^2 ] \rangle$ ] . with the help of this notation , inequality ( [ nongi1 ] ) succinctly reads [ nongi1b ]    in @xcite a simple proof of this inequality has been provided , by inserting a complete set of normalized momentum eigenstates @xmath223 into the quantity @xmath224   [ \delta^2 ] \rangle$ ] of the left hand side of ( [ nongi1b ] ) . the zero - momentum , long wavelength eigenstate provides the square of the squeezed 3pt function in the right hand side , to which one has to add the additional ( positive definite ) contributions that lead to the inequality above . in the collapsed limit and single source case , the additional contributions vanish and one saturates the inequality . although less explored in the literature , it is also possible to build further inequalities involving collapsed and squeezed limits of higher point functions ( see for example @xcite ) : the virtue of the method of @xcite is that the proofs of such inequalities can be straightforwardly generalized to those cases . as specific examples , we can write the following inequalities satisfied by five and six point functions , in appropriate collapsed limits    [ ^3 ] [ ^2 ] & & [ nongi2 ] + [ nongi3 ] [ ^3 ] [ ^3 ] & & using the methods of @xcite , it is relatively straightforward to prove that the inequalities saturate to equalities in the single source case . these inequalities have been used in section [ sec : stocp ] for physically interpreting the notion of stochastic halo bias applied to power spectra of halos and matter . when considering stochastic halo bias for the bispectra , section [ sec : stocb ] other inequalities are needed , that involve subtler collapsed limits among higher order point functions . we collect them here & & + [ ^2 ] [ ^2 ] & & + [ ^2 ] & & they can be analyzed and proved again with the methods of @xcite . n.  bartolo , e.  komatsu , s.  matarrese and a.  riotto , `` non -

The authors use a generalized univariate approach to analyze the statistics of halo and matter bispectra, which are sensitive to the primordial non-gaussianity of the gravitational potential.

The authors start by discussing the concept of intrinsic non-gaussianity and its relation to the primordial curvature perturb","the statistics of large - scale structure in the universe can be used to probe non - gaussianity of the primordial density field , complementary to existing constraints from the cosmic microwave background . in particular , the scale dependence of halo bias , which affects the halo distribution at large scales , represents a promising tool for analyzing primordial non - gaussianity of local form . 
 future observations , for example , may be able to constrain the trispectrum parameter @xmath0 that is difficult to study and constrain using the cmb alone . 
 we investigate how galaxy and matter bispectra can distinguish between the two non - gaussian parameters @xmath1 and @xmath0 , whose effects give nearly degenerate contributions to the power spectra . 
 we use a generalization of the univariate bias approach , making the hypothesis that the number density of halos forming at a given position is a function of the local matter density contrast and of its local higher - order statistics . using this approach , 
 we calculate the halo - matter bispectra and analyze their properties . 
 we determine a connection between the sign of the halo bispectrum on large scales and the parameter @xmath0 . 
 we also construct a combination of halo and matter bispectra that is sensitive to @xmath1 , with little contamination from @xmath0 . 
 we study both the case of single and multiple sources to the primordial gravitational potential , discussing how to extend the concept of stochastic halo bias to the case of bispectra . 
 we use a specific halo mass - function to calculate numerically the bispectra in appropriate squeezed limits , confirming our theoretical findings .",96333,545,1684,128.79 seconds,-72.58 MB,0.3323262839879154,0.15805471124620057,0.2416918429003021,0.8425746560096741,medium
"in previous publications @xcite , methods to compute the modified bessel function @xmath0 for positive @xmath3 were described . we complete here this analysis by describing analogous methods for the computation of the function @xmath1 . with this , methods for the reliable computation of a pair of linearly independent numerically satisfactory solutions become available which find their implementation in the accompanying paper @xcite . methods to compute their derivatives are also provided . the functions @xmath0 and @xmath1 are solutions of the modified bessel equation for imaginary orders    @xmath5    the function @xmath0 finds application in a number of problems of physics and applied mathematics @xcite . the function @xmath1 is a real valued numerically satisfactory companion to @xmath0 in the sense described in @xcite , pp . 154155 .    in terms of the modified bessel function of the first kind @xmath6 , the solutions are defined as :    @xmath7\,,\,\ , l_{ia}(x)=\frac{1}{2}\left[i_{-ia}(x)+i_{ia}(x)\right ] , \label{definition}\ ] ]    with wronskian @xmath8=1/x$ ] . both @xmath0 and @xmath1 are real solutions for real @xmath9 and @xmath10 . because they are even functions of @xmath2 , in the sequel we will consider @xmath11 , although this restriction is not present in the code .    in section 2 , we describe the different methods of computation considered , namely : series expansions , asymptotic expansions for large @xmath3 , airy - type uniform asymptotic expansions , non - oscillating integral representations ( including a discussion on the quadrature rule ) and a continued fraction method . we avoid duplicating information already given in previous papers ; in particular , the references @xcite provide information required for building the algorithms of the accompanying paper @xcite . a few misprints in @xcite are corrected .    in section 3 , we include a discussion on the dominant asymptotic behaviour of the functions . these exponential dominant factors can be taken out , leading to scaled functions which can be computed in a much wider range . the algorithm described in the accompanying paper @xcite offers the possibility of computing scaled and unscaled functions . in @xcite methods are described to compute the @xmath0 for different regions in the @xmath12 plane . in particular , we considered series expansions @xcite , asymptotic expansions for large @xmath3 ( @xcite , eq . 9.7.2 ) , uniform asymptotic expansions for @xmath13 ( @xcite and @xcite , pg . 425 ) . also , non - oscillating integral representations @xcite are available . similar techniques are available for the computation of @xmath1 and the derivatives @xmath14 , @xmath15 . in addition , a continued fraction method can be applied for the computation of @xmath16 and @xmath14 . those techniques generally give at least two alternative methods for computing the functions in the @xmath12 plane for moderate values of @xmath3 and @xmath2 ; therefore , we can always compare different methods of computation for testing their accuracy . the selection of one or another method of computation in a given region will depend on the range of applicability of each method and its efficiency . we now describe the different methods of computation which are used in the programs . series expansions can be built which properly describe the solutions near the singular point ( @xmath17 ) of the defining differential equation ( [ ode ] ) . the idea , as described in @xcite , is to substitute the maclaurin series for @xmath6 ( @xcite , eq . 9.6.10 ) in eqs .

( [ series ] ) ) the dominant exponential behaviour @xmath23 and @xmath24 as @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) . an efficient method to compute the coefficients was described in @xcite ; this method is based on the fact that both @xmath21 and @xmath22 satisfy the three - term recurrence relation @xmath27 perron s theorem is inconclusive with respect to the existence of minimal solutions for this recurrence relation ; anyhow , the second equation in ( [ explicit ] ) confirms that neither @xmath21 nor @xmath22 are minimal solutions . therefore , forward recursion will be numerically stable . starting values can be computed taking into account that @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the coulomb phase shift , for which chebyshev expansions are available for double precision @xcite . namely , we have :    @xmath30,\\ \\ r_1=\frac{1}{1+a^2}\left\{\cos [ \sigma_0 ( a)-a\ln ( x/2)]-   a \sin[\sigma_0 ( a)-a\ln ( x/2 ) ] \right\ } , \end{array}\ ] ]    and @xmath31,\\ \\ f_1=\frac{1}{a(1+a^2)}\left\{\sin [ \sigma_0 ( a)-a\ln ( x/2 ) ] + a \cos[\sigma_0 ( a)-a\ln ( x/2)]\right\}\ , .   \end{array}\ ] ]    these formulas correct two misprints in @xcite ( eqs . 12 and 13 ) . series can be used for @xmath32 small . see @xcite , section 2 [ canv ] . asymptotic expansions for large @xmath3 are available from the known asymptotic expansion of @xmath6 ( @xcite , eq . 9.7.1 ) : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the hankel symbol , which satisfies @xmath35    bounds for the error terms ( @xmath36 , @xmath37 ) can be found in @xcite , pg . 269 , ex . 13.2 .    as discussed in @xcite the numerical performance of the asymptotic expansion for @xmath0 is of more restricted applicability than for the case of the evaluation of @xmath38 for real @xmath39 . furthermore , the continued fraction method described in @xcite covers the region where this expansion is of numerical interest . for this reason , the continued fraction method is the preferred algorithm for the evaluation of @xmath0 and @xmath40 for moderate values of @xmath2 . on the other hand the asymptotic expansion for @xmath1 turns out to be accurate in a wider region , which is a fortunate situation given that the continued fraction method is not available in this case . see @xcite , section 2 , for further details . asymptotic expansions for the derivatives are also available by differentiating eqs . ( [ largex ] ) .      the airy - type asymptotic expansions for @xmath0 can be found in @xcite and @xcite pg . 425 ; the analogous expansions for @xmath1 @xcite and @xmath40 are also available @xcite , while the expansion for @xmath41 can be derived in the same way . we summarize here the main features needed for the computation through these expansions , neglecting the error terms . further details can be found in @xcite and @xcite .    the expansion for @xmath0 and @xmath1 in terms of airy functions ( @xmath42 , @xmath43 and their derivatives ) reads    @xmath44 , \\ \\ l_{ia}(a z)=\frac{e^{a\pi/2 } \phi(\zeta)}{2a^{1/3 } } \left[{\mbox{bi}}(-a^{2/3}\zeta ) f_a ( \zeta ) +   \frac{1}{a^{4/3 } } { \mbox{bi}}^{\prime}(-a^{2/3}\zeta )   g_a ( \zeta)\right ] , \end{array } \label{unifun}\ ] ]    where @xmath45 as @xmath46 uniformly with respect to @xmath47 . error bounds for the asymptotic expansions of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 are given in @xcite . the quantity @xmath48 is given by    @xmath49    and    @xmath50    of course , it is crucial to compute accurately eqs . ( [ zeta ] ) for small @xmath48 . for this , series expansions around @xmath51 can be used . the evaluation of the coefficients near the turning point @xmath51 ( which is our region of interest ) can be performed via maclaurin series expansions of the quantities @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54(@xcite ) in terms of the variable @xmath55 ( see @xcite and @xcite for further details ) . asymptotic expansions for the derivatives can be found by differentiating eqs .

( [ ces ] ) and ( [ chi ] ) denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath48 . using eqs . ( [ ces ] ) the coefficients @xmath65 and @xmath66 can be computed from the coefficients @xmath53 and @xmath54 . details on the evaluation of @xmath53 and @xmath54 are given in @xcite , where an explicit maple algorithm is given for the computation of @xmath53 and @xmath54 for @xmath67 .    by computing the wronskian relation for the modified bessel functions and using the wronskian for bessel functions , it is easy to derive the relation @xmath68 which is a useful relation for checking the correctness of the approximations for the coefficients in the asymptotic expansions .    an algorithm to compute airy functions of a real variable is needed for the computation of these asymptotic expansions . in the routines @xcite we use algorithm 819 @xcite . these airy - type asymptotic expansion are applied in @xcite in a broad region around the turning point line @xmath69 . paths of steepest descent for integral representations of the modified bessel functions of imaginary orders and their derivatives are given in @xcite . apart from their application in asymptotics @xcite , these integrals are useful for building numerically stable ( non - oscillating ) integral representations for @xmath0 and @xmath70 , as described in @xcite . we complete here the analysis in @xcite by providing analogous expressions for the computation of @xmath1 and @xmath15 . additionally , we study further transformations of the integrals which enable us to obtain integral expressions suitable for computation by means of the trapezoidal rule . we have the following integral representations in the monotonic region @xcite @xmath72\ , e^{-x \phi(\tau)}\ , d \tau , \end{array } \label{kmon}\ ] ] where @xmath73 and @xmath74 , @xmath75 $ ] . the dominant exponential term ( @xmath76 ) has been factored out . the argument of the exponential in the integrand is @xmath77 this formula corrects a misprint in @xcite ( eq . 33 ) . the difference @xmath78 can be computed in a stable way for small values of @xmath79 by using the expression . @xmath80\,,\ ] ]    together with the definition of @xmath81 ( [ definiciones ] ) and specific algorithms to compute @xmath82 and @xmath83 for small @xmath79 . the non - oscillating integral representations for @xmath1 and its derivative can be written after factoring the dominant exponential contribution as :    @xmath84 \label{lmon}\ ] ]    where @xmath85=2x\left(\sqrt{1-(a / x)^2}-\frac{a}{x}\arccos(\frac{a}{x})\right ) \end{array}\ ] ] and using eq . ( [ definiciones ] ) @xmath86 .\ ] ]    the first integral is dominant over the second one for large values of the parameters and @xmath87 not too close to @xmath69 . as @xmath88 both integrals become of the same order . similarly , we have the following representation for @xmath15 :    @xmath89 \label{lpmon}\ ] ]    where @xmath90\ ] ]    these integral representations for @xmath1 and @xmath15 can be used for checking the computation of these functions in the monotonic region . they are not used by our algorithms @xcite because the airy - type asymptotic expansion ( section [ atuae ] ) and the expansion for large @xmath3 ( section [ asyx ] ) are sufficiently accurate for this functions and they are faster to compute ( see @xcite , section 2 ) . the non - oscillating integral representations for the oscillatory region are more difficult to evaluate numerically than those for the monotonic case . indeed , as it was discussed in @xcite , the steepest descent method leads to three integrals , which have to be computed separately . however , as we later discuss , for moderately large @xmath2 it will be enough to compute a single integral .    in @xcite , the following formula was obtained :    @xmath92\ , , \end{array }   \label{oscil}\ ] ]    where @xmath93 , @xmath94 ,    @xmath95    and    @xmath96    notice that each of the three integrals in eq . ( [ oscil ] ) can in principle be integrated with respect to any of the two variables @xmath81 and @xmath79 , taking into account eq . ( [ sigma ] ) together with the fact that the integration path @xmath97 is such that @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 ; however , as discussed in @xcite there are strong numerical reasons for the selections made . in particular , the third integral is performed with respect to @xmath101 ( which requires numerical inversion of ( [ sigma ] ) ) to avoid the singularity of @xmath102 at @xmath103 . as explained in @xcite the numerical inversion of ( [ sigma ] ) in the interval @xmath104 $ ] can be efficiently performed in parallel with the numerical integration . similar integral representations exist for @xmath105 , @xmath1 and @xmath15 . we have :    @xmath106 \end{array }   \label{oscil2}\ ] ]    where @xmath107    in addition , integral representations for @xmath1 and its derivative are :    @xmath108 \label{oscil3 } \end{array}\ ] ]    and    @xmath109 \label{oscil4 } \end{array}\ ] ]    notice that the dominant exponential behaviour has been factored for both the functions @xmath0 and @xmath1 and their derivatives , which coincides with the exponential behaviour of the uniform asymptotic expansion . this is an interesting feature when computing scaled functions in order to avoid overflows and/or underflows in the computation . after factoring the dominant exponential terms ( @xmath110 ) , the overflow and/or underflow problems are eliminated ; notice , however , that when computing the integrals over finite intervals we should evaluate @xmath111 , @xmath112 for @xmath1 and its derivative and @xmath113 , @xmath114 for @xmath0 ( and @xmath105 ) instead of computing the hyperbolic and the exponential separately ( otherwise , overflows will take place for moderately large @xmath2 ) . for this reason it is convenient to use the expressions @xmath115 in the evaluation of eqs . ( [ oscil ] ) and ( [ oscil2 ] ) and to proceed in the same way for @xmath116 and @xmath117 in eqs . ( [ oscil3 ] ) and ( [ oscil4 ] ) . notice that in the oscillatory region @xmath118 and that for large @xmath2 and @xmath3 both @xmath119 and @xmath120 will underflow . these underflow problems can be easily avoided by neglecting these exponential terms for large parameters . in addition , when both exponentials become negligible , the integral over sigma becomes negligible and the remaining two integrals can be approximated by only one integral . we can write    @xmath121    \\ \\ k'_{ia}(x)\approx e^{-\pi a/2}\left [    \displaystyle\int_{\tau_0}^{\infty } e^{-\psi(\tau ) }   \left(\cos \chi\ , a(\tau)+\sin\chi\ , c(\tau ) \right)d\tau + { \cal o}(e^{-\pi a/2 } ) \right ] \\ \\   l_{ia}(x)\approx\frac{e^{\pi a/2}}{2\pi}\left [    \displaystyle\int_{\tau_0}^{\infty } e^{-\psi(\tau ) }   \left (   \sin\chi -\cos\chi\frac{d\sigma}{d\tau }       \right)d\tau   + { \cal o}(e^{-\pi a/2 } ) \right ] \\ \\ l^{\prime}_{ia}(x)\approx \frac{e^{\pi a/2}}{2\pi } \left [   \displaystyle\int_{\tau_0}^{\infty } e^{-\psi(\tau ) }   \left ( \sin\chi\ , a(\tau ) - \cos\chi\ , c(\tau)\right)d\tau + { \cal o}(e^{-\pi a/2 } ) \right ] \end{array } \label{simplificado}\ ] ]    where @xmath122    these approximations can be used for moderately large @xmath2 , which is the region where integrals for the oscillatory case are employed in the code @xcite . it is however useful to have the complete expressions for testing the rest of the methods . the computation through quadrature using eqs . ( [ kmon ] ) , ( [ lmon ] ) , ( [ lpmon ] ) , ( [ oscil ] ) , ( [ oscil2 ] ) , ( [ oscil3 ] ) and ( [ oscil4 ] ) , provides a way for computing the functions in the whole @xmath12 plane , except close to @xmath69 , where the integrands become non - smooth . for this reason , they have been used for checking the algorithm , although in the oscillatory region only eq . ( [ simplificado ] ) is necessary when building the numerical algorithm @xcite . as reported in goodwin @xcite , the trapezoidal rule is a very efficient method of computation of integrals @xmath123 for rapidly decaying integrands @xmath124 ; in particular , it is know that the error decays as @xmath125 for integrals of the type @xmath126 with @xmath127 analytic in @xmath128 . after appropriate changes of variable , similar arguments follow for integrals over finite intervals with a smooth integrand @xcite . the semi - infinite integrals in this section are appropriate for their computation by using the trapezoidal rule , because they decay as a double exponential as @xmath129 . on the other hand , the integrals over finite intervals show abrupt variations as @xmath88 , particularly in the oscillatory case , but under an adequate change of variables they can be also computed efficiently by means of the trapezoidal rule . for finite integrals , we consider a change of variable in order to map the finite interval @xmath130 $ ] into @xmath131 and a successive change to improve the convergence of the trapezoidal rule @xcite ; namely , we consider the following transformation :    @xmath132    and the integral is discretized by means of the trapezoidal rule with equal mesh size : @xmath133    where the error @xmath134 is expected to decay very fast as the mesh size is decreased because the integrand is analytic and its decay is doubly exponential . we use a trapezoidal rule which halves the mesh size until the prescribed precision is reached ; the same rule controls that the truncation of the infinite series ( [ dis ] ) gives an error well below the accuracy claim .    regarding the semi - infinite integrals , we use a change of variable to transform the integration interval @xmath135 to @xmath136 . we consider the following change of variables to perform this map . @xmath137 the additional change @xmath138 improves the convergence of the trapezoidal rule . it is observed that , typically , no more than @xmath139 iterations of the trapezoidal rule are needed , which means that the integrands are evaluated at @xmath140 points in the worst cases . this is the typical number of iterations for the evaluation of @xmath141 by means of a recursive trapezoidal rule when double precision accuracy is demanded . this fact confirms that the above mentioned changes of variable are adequate for the computation of the integrals for the modified bessel functions .      as discussed in @xcite both @xmath0 and @xmath142 can be computed for moderate @xmath2 by means of a continued fraction method , similar to the corresponding method for bessel functions of real orders ( see @xcite and @xcite , pp . 239 - 240 ) . we refer to @xcite for a full description of this scheme . as numerical experiments show , this method is competitive in speed with asymptotic expansions for large @xmath3 ( section [ asyx ] ) and the range of application is larger . therefore , the continued fraction method substitutes the use of asymptotic expansions for large @xmath3 . as described in previous sections , the integral representations which were developed indicate that the dominant behaviour for the functions when the parameters are large is of exponential type . this means that the computations can only be carried for not too large values of @xmath2 and @xmath3 in order to avoid overflows / underflows in the computation . for instance , from eqs . ( [ oscil ] ) and ( [ oscil2 ] ) it is seen that for large @xmath2 ( @xmath143 ) , we have @xmath144 and similarly for the derivative , while for @xmath1 and its derivative ( eqs . ( [ oscil3 ] ) and ( [ oscil4 ] ) ) the asymptotic behaviour is @xmath145 . this means that to avoid overflow / underflows in the computation , we must restrict the range of @xmath2 in the oscillatory region to @xmath146 where @xmath147 is either the inverse of the underflow number ( when computing @xmath0 or its derivative ) or the overflow number ( for @xmath1 and its derivative ) ; @xmath148 is a safety factor ( in the program , we take @xmath149 ) . for processors using the ieee standard in double precision this will approximately limit @xmath2 to @xmath150 . on the other hand , for the monotonic region ( @xmath71 ) the integral representations show that the dominant exponential behaviour is @xmath151 , @xmath152 where @xmath153 , @xmath154 ( @xmath155 $ ] ) , and similarly for the derivatives . this means that , in order to avoid overflows / underflows , the range of computation must be restricted to : @xmath156      given that all our expressions have the dominant exponential contributions factored out , exponentially scaled functions can be defined which are computable in wider ranges . namely , we define : @xmath158 and @xmath159      note that , as in the rest of the article , we are considering positive @xmath2 because @xmath0 and @xmath1 are even functions of @xmath2 . of course , when applying the scaling factors for negative @xmath2 , we should replace @xmath2 by @xmath160 in the exponential scaling factors of eqs . ( [ escaladas ] ) and ( [ escaladas2 ] ) . in this way , the scaled functions are also even functions of @xmath2 . the definitions in ( [ escaladas ] ) and ( [ escaladas2 ] ) eliminate exactly the front exponential factor in the oscillatory region @xmath161 ) from the series and the airy type asymptotic expansion and in all the @xmath12 plane for the the integral representations . in other cases , there remains an exponential factor with soft variation . for example , when using airy - type expansions in the monotonic region ( neglecting non - exponential factors ) , we have @xmath162 where @xmath163 which is small for @xmath164 ( @xmath165 ) ; loss of accuracy in the computation of @xmath166 for @xmath164 can be reduced by expanding @xmath166 in powers of @xmath167 .              99 m. abramowitz , i. stegun ( eds ) . _ handbook of mathematical functions . _ national bureau of standards . applied mathematics series , no . government printing office , washington dc ( 1964 ) . asymptotic expansions of the modified bessel function of the third kind of imaginary order . siam j. appl . 15(5 ) ( 1967 ) 13151323 . cody , k.e . chebyshev approximations for the coulomb phase shift . math . comp . 24 ( 1970 ) 671 - 677 . bessel functions of purely imaginary order , with an application to second order linear differential equations having a large parameter . siam j. math . 21(4 ) ( 1990 ) 951018 . b. r. fabijonas . laplace s method on a computer algebra system with an application to the real valued modified bessel functions . j. comput .

"the _ heat kernel approach _ ( hka for short ) , which will be presented and discussed in this paper , is a systematic method to construct state price densities which are analytically tractable . to be precise on analytic tractability , we mean with this notion that bond prices can be calculated explicitly , and that caps , swaptions or other derivatives on bonds can be calculated up to one integration with respect to the law of the underlying factor markov process . therefore such models can be easily calibrated to market data and are useful for pricing and hedging purposes , but also for purposes of risk management . the original motivation of introducing the hka was in modelling of interest rates with jumps . in the hjm framework @xcite , the drift condition becomes quite complicated ( see h. shirakawa s pioneering work @xcite , see also @xcite and references therein ) if taking jumps into account , while in the spot rate approach , one will find it hard to obtain explicit expressions of the bond prices ( the affine class is almost the only exception ) . in @xcite , the state price density approach . ] is applied and by means of transition probability densities of some lvy processes explicit expressions of the zero coupon bond prices are obtained . the hka is actually a full extension of the method , and thanks to the generalization its applications are now not limited to jump term structure models as we will show in the sequel .    before the presentation of the theorem , we will give a brief survey of the state price density approaches such as the potential approach by l.c.g . rogers @xcite or hughston s approach @xcite @xcite , etc , in section [ spda ] and section [ lreview ] . our models are within the class of _ markov functional models _ proposed by p.  hunt , j.  kennedy and a.  pelsser @xcite , and therefore compatible with their practical implementations . one of the contributions of the hka to the literature could be to give a systematic way to produce markov functional models .    as a whole , this paper is meant to be an introduction to the hka , together with some examples . topics from practical viewpoint like fitting to the real market , tractable calibration , or econometric empirical studies , are not treated in this paper . nonetheless we note that hka is an alternative approach to practical as well as theoretical problems in interest rate modeling . we will start from a brief survey of state price densities . by a _ market _ , we mean a family of price - dividend pairs @xmath0 , @xmath1 , which are adapted processes defined on a filtered probability space @xmath2 . a strictly positive process @xmath3 is a _ state price density _ with respect to the market if for any @xmath1 , it holds that @xmath4,\ ] ] or for any @xmath5 , @xmath6.\ ] ] in other words , @xmath7 gives a ( random ) discount factor of a cash flow @xmath8 at time @xmath9 multiplied by a radon nikodym derivative . if we denote by @xmath10 the market value at time @xmath11 of zero - coupon bond with maturity @xmath9 , then the formula ( [ cff2 ] ) gives @xmath12.\ ] ] from a perspective of modeling term structure of interest rates , the formula ( [ spd ] ) says that , given a filtration , each strictly positive process @xmath13 generates an _ arbitrage - free _ interest rate model . on the basis of this observation , we can construct arbitrage - free interest rate models . notice that we do not assume @xmath14 to be a submartingale , i.e. in economic terms _ we do not assume positive short rates_.      the rational log - normal model by flesaker and hughston @xcite was a first successful interest rate model derived from the state price density approach . they put @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are deterministic decreasing process , @xmath18 is a one dimensional standard brownian motion and @xmath19 is a constant . the model is an analytically tractable , leads to positive - short rates , and is fitting any initial yield curve . furthermore closed - form solutions for both caps and swaptions are available . several extensions of this approach are known .    in @xcite , rogers introduced a more systematic method to construct positive - rate models which he called the _ potential approach_. actually he introduced two approaches ; in the first one , @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the resolvent operator of a markov process on a state space @xmath22 , @xmath23 is a positive function on @xmath22 , and @xmath24 is a positive constant . in the second one , @xmath23 is specified as a linear combination of the eigenfunctions of the generator of @xmath25 . note that when @xmath25 is a brownian motion , @xmath26 for any @xmath27 is an eigenfunction of its generator , and the model gives another perspective to the rational lognormal models above .    in @xcite l. hughston and a.  rafailidis proposed yet another framework for interest rate modelling based on the state price density approach , which they call a _ chaotic approach to interest rate modelling_. the wiener chaos expansion technique is then used to formulate a systematic analysis of the structure and classification of interest rate models . actually , m.r . grasselli and t.r . hurd @xcite revisit the cox - ingersoll - ross model of interest rates in the view of the chaotic representation and they obtain a simple expression for the fundamental random variable @xmath28 as @xmath29)^2 | \mathcal{f}_t ] $ ] holds . in line with these , a stable property of the second - order chaos is shown in @xcite . in this section we present the simple concepts of the heat kernel approach ( hka ) and several classes of possibly interesting examples . the guiding philosophy of hka is the following : if one can easily calculate expectations of the form @xmath30 for some factor markov process @xmath31 , and if one knows _ explicitly _ one additional function @xmath32 depending on time and the state variables , then one can construct explicit formulas for bond prices , and analytically tractable formulas for caps , swaptions , etc ( i.e. , those formulas are evaluated by one numerical integration with respect to the law of the underlying markov process ) . in other words , any explicit solution of a well - understood kolmogorov equation with respect to some markov process leads to a new class of interest rate models . we consider a general markov process @xmath33 on a polish state space @xmath22 and a probability space @xmath34 with filtration @xmath35 . let @xmath36 defined on @xmath37 be a strictly positive function . it is said to satisfy the * propagation property with respect to @xmath31 * if @xmath38 for all @xmath39 and @xmath40 . we assume furthermore that @xmath41 for @xmath42 . let @xmath43 satisfy the propagation property with respect to the markov process @xmath31 and @xmath44 . we define then a state price density @xmath14 through @xmath45 we clearly have the following basic assertion :    [ hkabond ] bond prices are given through @xmath46 for @xmath47 and @xmath40 . the bond prices are calculated with respect to the state price density ( [ spdofhka ] ) through @xmath48 actually , by the markov property and by the propagation property we can calculate the right hand side , @xmath49 for all @xmath40 and @xmath47 . notice that this remarkable simple formula is given with respect to the * historical*/*physical * measure . a derivative with payoff @xmath50 on @xmath51 for some @xmath47 has at time @xmath52 the price @xmath53,\ ] ] which is analytically tractable if one knows how to calculate expectations of the form @xmath54 . notice that the initial term structure is given in the previous setting through @xmath55 for @xmath56 . let @xmath33 with a polish state space @xmath22 on a probability space @xmath34 with filtration @xmath35 . take a measurable , bounded @xmath57 , then @xmath58 satisfies the propagation property ( [ propro ] ) . this example demonstrates that the previous theory covers the results of @xcite . indeed , consider a @xmath59-dimensional lvy process @xmath60 starting at @xmath61 in its natural filtration . we assume that it has a density @xmath62 with respect to lebesgue measure . then @xmath63 defines a markov process on @xmath64 and we have that @xmath65 for @xmath66 and @xmath67 . notice that this example can be associated to the previous example [ genericexample ] if one allows @xmath68 in the sense of distributions . consider an affine markov process @xmath25 on @xmath69 and @xmath70 such that @xmath71 exist . then we define @xmath72 for some numbers @xmath73 . in the spirit of the previous generic example we obtain @xmath74 for @xmath75 and each initial value @xmath76 . notice that the `` laplace transforms '' @xmath77 are easily calculated for affine processes , which yields a concrete representation of the prices in the physical measure . these models are completely new interest models constructed from affine models . for instance , the derived short rate models have interesting ( econometric ) features . an example driven by the affine cox - ingersoll - ross process is visualized in figure 1 . the pay - off ( at its maturity @xmath78 ) of a ( unit of ) swaption is @xmath79 where @xmath80 with @xmath81 is the tenor structure of the swap contract , and @xmath82 is the swap rate ( see e.g. @xcite*chapter 1 , section 6 ) . note that ( [ pay - off1 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath83 therefore in the state price density approach , the quantity @xmath84 we get @xmath85 by hka , namely @xmath86 where @xmath32 has the propagation property w.r.t . a markov process @xmath25 . we have @xmath87 , \end{split}\ ] ] which is again  up to integration with respect to the law of @xmath25  explicit . assume that @xmath36 is differentiable with respect to @xmath88 . then the short rate @xmath89 of the previous interest rate model is given through @xmath90 since @xmath91 the sign of the short rate is determined through @xmath92 notice that we do not necessarily have a short rate process . take a finite dimensional manifold @xmath93 and take @xmath25 a markov process with values in @xmath93 . a non - vanishing function @xmath94 with @xmath95 for some @xmath96 is called eigenfunction of @xmath31 . let @xmath97 , @xmath98 be eigenfuntions with eigenvalues @xmath99 , and let @xmath100 be decreasing functions . set @xmath101 then we notice that @xmath102 is a supermartingale , too . if @xmath103 is strictly positive and @xmath104 , then we can construct an arbitrage - free positive interest rate model by setting @xmath105 as a state price density . we call such models the _ eigenfunction models_.    the class includes the generic approach ii in the potential approach by rogers @xcite , and is included in the flesaker - hughston s general framework since @xmath106 becomes a martingale ( see section [ lreview ] ) . the formula ( [ swaption : formula ] ) becomes extremely simple when we use the _ eigenfunction model_. @xmath107 where @xmath23 satisfies ( [ eigenf ] ) . by applying ( [ eigens ] ) on ( [ swaption : formula ] ) , we obtain the following result .    [ swpformula ] the pricing formula of the swaption is @xmath108 where @xmath109 and @xmath110    let @xmath31 be a brownian motion with drift : whose generator is @xmath111 where @xmath112 . for @xmath113 with @xmath114 , we have @xmath115 therefore , if @xmath116 is such that @xmath117 ( this is always possible , take @xmath118 for example ) , then the state price density @xmath119 where @xmath120 , gives a positive rate model . in this case @xmath121 where @xmath122 notice that the black - scholes formula for the price at time @xmath11 of the call option with the strike @xmath123 and the maturity @xmath9 is given by @xmath124 this example corresponds to the flesaker - hughston s rational log - normal model @xcite . let @xmath31 be an ornstein - uhlenbeck process on @xmath125 , whose generator @xmath126 is given by @xmath127 where @xmath128 . setting @xmath129 , we have @xmath130 therefore we have that @xmath131 is an eigenfunction with the eigenvalue @xmath132 . setting @xmath133 and @xmath134 , we obtain @xmath135 where @xmath136 , @xmath137 and @xmath138 for the proof see the appendix [ ap : ou ] . as we have pointed out the propagation property of @xmath32 does not ensure that the process @xmath139 is a supermartingale . thus , the interest rate model with @xmath140 does not exclude the possibility of negative rates . in this section we provide models based on hka and leading to positive short rates . let @xmath32 be a positive function with propagation property with respect to a markov process @xmath25 , and a weight @xmath141 such that @xmath142 for arbitrary @xmath143 and @xmath144 . set @xmath145 then we have    [ potential1 ] the process @xmath146 is a supermartingale . for @xmath147 and @xmath40 , we have @xmath148 here we have used the propagation property of @xmath32 . since @xmath149 we have the desired result . thus interest rate models with @xmath150 have positive short rates . the class is an extension of the potential models defined in @xcite , since we can take @xmath32 as in and @xmath151 . let @xmath152 be a non - negative , measurable function defined on @xmath22 . put @xmath153 and @xmath154 then the bond market spanned by @xmath155 is arbitrage - free with respect to the state price density @xmath156 indeed , this corresponds to an additional factor @xmath157 for @xmath158 added to the markov process @xmath31 . since @xmath159 is again a markov process on @xmath160 , we notice that @xmath161 defined on @xmath162 satisfies the propagation property . therefore the previously described bond prices are arbitrage - free with respect to the stated state price densities for initial values @xmath163 . since @xmath164 is decreasing in @xmath88 the short rates are again positive . we give a third , more involved method to obtain positive rate models . though it is only valid for symmetric lvy processes at this stage , again the class is completely new . let @xmath165 be a @xmath166-dimensional lvy process , which is symmetric in the sense that @xmath167 . we define @xmath168 . note that in this case its lvy symbol is positive and symmetric , i.e. @xmath169 for some @xmath170 which is symmetric in the sense that @xmath171 . let @xmath172 be a measure on @xmath64 such that @xmath173 for any borel set @xmath16 . put @xmath174 assuming it is finite ( except at @xmath175 ) for each @xmath67 . the function @xmath176 is non - negative and has the propagation property with respect to @xmath177 . first , notice that by the symmetry of @xmath172 we have @xmath178 and @xmath179 for any @xmath67 . then by bochner s theorem we know that @xmath180 is non - negative definite and we see that @xmath181 for any @xmath67 .    since @xmath182 , @xmath183 \leq 1 $ ] for any @xmath184 and @xmath67 , we have @xmath185    if the fourier transform @xmath186 exists and is bounded in @xmath187 , then by the symmetry of @xmath172 it holds that @xmath188 , and @xmath176 has the following expression : @xmath189 on the other hand , let @xmath172 be the lebesgue measure of @xmath64 . if the density @xmath190 of @xmath191 exists in @xmath192 , we have @xmath193 that is , @xmath176 is the heat kernel . we are now able to prove the following theorem on supermartingales constructed from heat kernels :    [ mainth ] let @xmath116 be a positive constant greater than @xmath194 and let @xmath195 be any positive constant . set @xmath196 . then @xmath197 is a supermartingale with respect to the natural filtration of @xmath25 .    by the expression ( [ realu ] ) , we have @xmath198 since @xmath199 and @xmath200 is positive , @xmath201 thus we obtain @xmath202 and then @xmath203 on the other hand , by an elementary inequality we have @xmath204 and since @xmath200 is positive , we obtain @xmath205 combining ( [ 2ndineq ] ) and ( [ 3rdineq ] ) , we have @xmath206 the right - hand - side of ( [ 4thineq ] ) is non - negative since @xmath207 and @xmath208 is decreasing in @xmath11 . finally , since we have @xmath209 =   u ( \lambda+2t - t , x^x_{t } ) +   c u ( t+\lambda,0),\ ] ] we now see that @xmath210 is a supermartingale .      by the above theorem , we can now construct a positive interest rate model by setting @xmath211 to be a state price density , or equivalently @xmath212 here we give some explicit examples . in all examples , @xmath116 is a constant greater than @xmath194 and @xmath195 some positive constant . a simple example is obtained by letting @xmath213 where the bond prices are expressed as @xmath214    a similar model can be obtained by setting , for @xmath215 , @xmath216 a visualization of this model is shown in figure 2 . let @xmath217 be a cauchy process in @xmath125 starting from @xmath187 . the explicit form of the transition density of @xmath218 is known to be @xmath219 where @xmath220 and @xmath221 ( see e.g.@xcite ) . note that cauchy processes are strictly stable ( or self - similar ) process with parameter @xmath222 ; namely , @xmath223 this property is seen from their lvy symbol : actually we have @xmath224   = e^ { - t ( \theta |\xi| - i \langle \xi , \gamma \rangle ) } .\ ] ] if we set @xmath225 , the density turns symmetric and therefore , setting @xmath226 , we obtain an explicit positive term structure model . we give the explicit form of the bond prices in the case of @xmath227 : @xmath228 the model is a modification of the cauchy tsms given in @xcite . let @xmath229 be lvy process and @xmath230 be a subordinator independent of @xmath231 . recall that the process @xmath232 is usually called the subordination of @xmath25 by the subordinator @xmath9 . among the subordinations of the wiener process , two classes are often used in the financial context ; one is the _ variance gamma _ processes and the other is _ normal inverse gaussian _ processes , since they are analytically tractable ( see @xcite and references therein ) . the subordinator of a variance gamma process ( resp . normal inverse gaussian process ) is a gamma process ( resp . inverse gaussian process ) . if we let the drift of the wiener process be zero , then the densities of the subordinated processes satisfies the condition for theorem [ mainth ] . the gamma subordinator @xmath233 is a lvy process with @xmath234 where @xmath235 and @xmath236 are positive constants . then the heat kernel of the subordinated wiener process @xmath237 is @xmath238 from this expression we have @xmath239 the heat kernel ( [ vgdensity ] ) can be expressed in terms of the modified bessel functions @xmath240 , @xmath241 , which has an integral representation @xmath242 actually we have @xmath243    the heat kernel of the inverse gaussian subordinator @xmath244 is @xmath245 where @xmath235 and @xmath246 are positive constants . the heat kernel of the subordinated wiener process @xmath247 is @xmath248 applying ( [ mbessel ] ) , we obtain @xmath249 in particular , we have @xmath250 [ a1 ] for @xmath251 , @xmath252 , and @xmath253 , it holds @xmath254 where @xmath255                                    , _ lvy processes and infinitely divisible distributions _ , vol . 68 of _ cambridge studies in advanced mathematics _ , cambridge university press , 1999 . translated from the 1990 japanese original ; revised by the author .","The text discusses the heat kernel approach (HKA) in the context of interest rate modeling.

"dwarf galaxies play a key role in the enrichment of the icm or igm , not only as far as heavy elements are concerned , but possibly also regarding the magnetisation . according to the standard bottom - up scenario of galaxy formation , primeval galaxies must have injected much of their ( enriched ) interstellar medium ( ism ) into the igm during the initial bursts of star formation , thereby  polluting  large volumes of intergalactic space because of their high number density . by the same token , the following two properties render dwarf galaxies potentially very efficient in injecting a relativistic plasma into their surroundings : first , they exist in large numbers , and second , they possess low escape velocities , making it easier to expel their interstellar gas , as compared to massive spiral galaxies . such galactic winds are in fact seen in some prototypical low - mass galaxies in the local universe . galaxy clusters are known to be pervaded by a relativistic plasma , i.e. particles with ( mildly ) relativistic energy and magnetic fields . in the centres of some rich clusters , radio halos have been found , produced by either primary or secondary electrons ( see fig . [ fig1 ] , left ) . the problem with primary electrons is their relatively short lifetime , limited by synchrotron and inverse - compton losses : @xmath0^{-1/2 } \,\ , \rm yr \;,\ ] ] where @xmath1 is the equivalent magnetic field strength of the cosmic microwave background . this latter equation results from the similar dependences of synchrotron and inverse - compton losses , @xmath2 @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the magnetic energy density @xmath5 , and @xmath6 is the energy density of the radiation field ( which for the perfect black - body cmb radiation is @xmath7 ) . ( [ eqn1 ] ) then tells us that , for instance , with a magnetic field of @xmath8 g , particles radiating at 1.4  ghz will be rendered invisible after @xmath9  yr in the local universe ( @xmath10 ) . hence , primary electrons require continuous injection . however , diffuse radio halos are never associated with any obvious `` fresh '' sources , one therefore has to invoke secondary electrons . these are produced by hadronic collisions of relativistic protons with the thermal gas in a pion - muon chain . owing to their much larger mass , protons have synchrotron lifetimes exceeding a hubble time . finally , it should pointed out that completely independent evidence for the magnetisation of ( at least the ) central regions of galaxy clusters comes from the observation of faraday rotation ( e.g. @xcite ) . clusters undergoing large - scale merging frequently exhibit so - called radio relics , mostly on their periphery ( fig . [ fig1 ] , right ) . in contrast to radio halos , these are significantly polarised , probably reflecting magnetic - field enhancement in the compression zones where the subclusters produce large - scale shockwaves during their mutual penetration . naturally , this also provides an efficient acceleration mechanism . particles that were formerly highly relativistic ( electrons in particular ) have cooled via synchrotron and inverse - compton losses . during a cluster merger , they are boosted to high energies again , and the acceleration regions shine up in the radio regime . kronberg et al . ( @xcite ) were the first to raise the question whether low - mass galaxies could have made a significant contribution to the magnetisation of the igm ( apart from more massive starburst galaxies and agn ) . owing to their large number ( observed and predicted in a cdm cosmology ) and their injection of relativistic particles as described above , they could have played a cardinal role in the context of this cosmologically important scenario . if true , it is to be expected that dwarf galaxies are `` wrapped '' in large envelopes of previously highly relativistic particles - and magnetic fields , which are pushed out of them during epochs of vigorous star formation . @xcite have discussed this more quantitatively and made predictions for the strengths of magnetic seed fields , to be then amplified by large - scale dynamos over cosmic time . in particular , they also predict the existence of magnetic voids . of course , in magnetising the icm / igm , low - mass galaxies have been competing with agn . judging from the radio luminosities of the `` culprits '' , it is clear that nevertheless low - mass galaxies may have contributed significantly . a typical starburst dwarf galaxy emits a monochromatic radio luminosity of @xmath11  w  hz@xmath12 , while this figure is @xmath13  w  hz@xmath12 for radio galaxies in the fri / ii transition regime . hence , the radio power produced by agn is some 15000 times larger than that of dwarf galaxies . however , ( @xmath14cdm ) cosmology helps at this point , since dwarf galaxies have come in huge numbers if the bottom - up scenario of structure formation holds . furthermore , the lifetime of radio galaxies is limited ( @xcite ) , @xmath15  yr , with duty cycles of @xmath16  yr . hence , this yields an effective activity period of @xmath17  yr  @xmath18 . finally , it should be noted that central so - called `` mini - halos '' , which are bright extended radio sources located in the centres of cooling - flow clusters ( perseusa , hydraa , virgoa ) can not do the magnetisation job : they are pressure - confined . measurements of the radio continuum radiation of dwarf galaxies over a large frequency range have shown that ongoing star formation in them is accompanied by enhanced radio continuum emission ( @xcite , @xcite ) . owing to their shallow gravitational potentials , the containment of relativistic cosmic - ray particles in such galaxies is , however , low , as inferred from studies of the spectral index and magnetic - field structure . [ fig2 ] demonstrates this : in contrast to massive spiral galaxies , whose radio continuum is dominated by synchrotron radiation at cm wavelengths ( @xcite ) there is a lack of it for dwarf galaxies . the lack is more pronounced the lower the luminosity ( hence mass ) of the dwarf galaxy ( @xcite ) . these relativistic particles streaming into the halos of dwarf galaxies lose their energy on a time scale of @xmath19  yr according to eqn . ( [ eqn1 ] ) via synchrotron and inverse - compton radiation . they are thus quickly rendered invisible at cm wavelengths , while their synchrotron emission will still be detectable at metre waves where their lifetime is 5 to 10 times longer . the containment of the relativistic plasma and its possible transport out of a galaxy is obviously influenced by the overall magnetic - field configuration . in massive disk galaxies ( spirals ) the face - on view shows that the magnetic field closely follows the spiral arms , while the edge - on view discloses a plane - parallel magnetic field close to the galactic planes , while the halo field flares at large galacto - centric distances , rendering its overall appearance x - shaped ( @xcite ) .        the existence of winds in low - mass galaxies is inferred from the observed kinematics of the gas ( measured with slit spectroscopy ) , but can arguably be also inferred from measurements of the temperature of the hot ( x - ray - emitting ) gas . for instance , @xcite found the outflow velocities in ngc1569 to exceed the escape speed , and @xcite derived a temperature of its hot , x - ray - emitting gas to exceed the virial temperature . the transport of a relativistic plasma out of this galaxy is strongly suggested by two observations ( @xcite ) . first , ngc1569 possesses a radio halo , extending out to about 2  kpc at 1.4  ghz ( see fig . [ fig3 ] , left ) . second , the projected orientation of its magnetic field as deduced from measurements of the linear radio polarisation is radial throughout ( fig . [ fig3 ] , right ) . this magnetic field is just dragged along with the wind , as the energy density of the wind is about 30 times that of the magnetic field . a similar finding was made by @xcite for the dwarf irregular ngc4449 , which also possesses a low - frequency radio halo ( @xcite ) . the lifetime of low - frequency halos around dwarf galaxies can be estimated using eqn . ( [ eqn1 ] ) . with @xmath20 g magnetic fields in their surroundings the dominant loss mechanism will be inverse compton , the lifetime of relativistic electrons radiating at 120  mhz then being of order 500  myr , much longer than for those seen at cm wavelengths . this is also illustrated in fig . [ fig4 ] , which sketches the temporal variation of an `` aging '' synchrotron spectrum . assume that the energy spectrum of the particles initially extended to infinity . as time elapses , high - energy particles quickly lose their energy , producing a break in the spectrum . this gives rise to a corresponding break in the radiation spectrum , which wanders more and more slowly towards lower frequencies as time elapses . hence , it takes much more time for this break to arrive at frequencies observed , e.g. , with lofar . the break frequency measures the time elapsed since the last starburst with its supernova activity has ceased .    while aging , particles that have left a dwarf galaxy by a wind will slowly diffuse away from it . this can happen with a maxmimum speed corresponding to the alfvenic one , i.e. @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the number density of thermal electrons ( or protons ) of the surrounding medium . taking @xmath23 g and @xmath24  @xmath25 , the relativistic particles radiating at 120  mhz could move out to @xmath26  kpc within 500  myr , or correspondingly further when caught at still lower frequencies . hence , such halos could have total sizes of @xmath27  kpc . lofar will easily detect low - frequency halos of dwarf galaxies out to large ( 100  mpc , coma cluster ) distances . the lofar survey , which will cover about half the sky and will be conducted within a year s time , will provide a 5-@xmath28 flux limit of 0.1  mjy / b.a . at 120  mhz in 1 hour ( with a synthesized beam of 13 , for long baselines ) . using the synchrotron halo of ngc4449 as a template , we can estimate the expected brightness at lofar frequencies , which is about 0.4  mjy / b.a . at 120  mhz . its detection should hence be feasible . assuming a 60  kpc diameter as estimated above and placing it at @xmath29  mpc it would be seen with a @xmath30  2  angular extent . in a cluster or group environment , such halos are likely to trail behind the galaxy as it moves in the cluster potential with speeds much larger than the diffusion speed of the relativistic particles . this will actually provide some information on the proper motion of dwarf galaxies having undergone star formation over the past @xmath31  yrs . an impressive example of such trailing low - frequency radio structures is seen in the perseus cluster , where the head - tail radio source ngc1265 leaves behind a huge radio tail that can be traced over a projected path of 1.1  mpc at low frequencies ( @xcite )    so , low - frequency radio emission `` memorises '' starburst activity up to about 1  gyr after its termination , a time scale much longer than that of any other integral property of galaxies ( h@xmath32 and fir luminosity , or broad - band optical / uv / ir colours ) . this emission therefore also provides a powerful diagnostic tool to search for post - starburst galaxies and to explore their recent - to - past star - formation rate ( sfr ) and magnetic field evolution .    in this context , lofar will also deliver important new information to address the long - standing question pertaining to possible evolutionary links between the two main classes of late - type dwarf galaxies , dwarf irregulars ( dis ) and blue compact dwarf galaxies ( bcdgs ) . bcdgs in a post - starburst phase will be easily identifiable by their weak radio emission at cm wavelengths in conjunction with their bright radio halos at meter wavelengths . by contrast , non - starbursting late - type dwarf galaxies will be rendered undetectable at cm wavelengths , while their low - frequency radio continuum emission should still exhibit the synchrotron halos created during past activity phases . hence , if the standard evolutionary scenario , i.e. from bcdgs to dis , is correct , then lofar will discover a large population of quiescent dis with low - frequency radio halos . uk expresses his deep gratitude for the warmhearted hospitality he experienced at _ the orthodox academy of crete _ and , in particular , to prof . alexandros k. papaderos and his family .","Dwarf galaxies play a crucial role in enriching the intergalactic medium (IGM) and are likely to be involved in magnetization of the intergalactic medium (IGM). They inject a significant amount of interstellar medium (ISM) into the IGM, which is then polluted by their high number density and low escape velocities. This process is essential for the formation of the IGM.

Key points:

1. **Dwarf galaxies inject a significant amount of ISM into the I","with the operation of lofar , a great opportunity exists to shed light on a problem of some cosmological significance . 
 diffuse radio synchrotron emission not associated to any obvious discrete sources as well as faraday rotation in clusters of galaxies both indicate that the intergalactic or intracluster medium ( igm , icm ) is pervaded by a weak magnetic field , along with a population of relativistic particles . both , particles and fields must have been injected into the igm either by active galactic nuclei ( agn ) or by normal star - forming galaxies . 
 excellent candidates for the latter are starburst dwarf galaxies , which in the framework of hierarchical structure formation must have been around in large numbers 
 . if this is true , one should be able to detect extended synchrotron halos of formerly highly relativistic particles around local starburst or post - starburst dwarf galaxies . 
 with lofar , one should easily find these out to the coma cluster and beyond .",12583,451,993,12.36 seconds,5.58 MB,0.3214285714285714,0.06306306306306307,0.18750000000000003,0.8176460862159729,medium
"one of the main features of many market and social processes is their bilateral structure and the need to match agents from one side of the market with the other side , e.g. students and schools in college admissions , employees and companies in the job market ( see * ? ? ? * ) , men and women in online dating sites , advertisers and advertising slots in sponsored search ( see * ? ? ? * ) . a class of `` two - sided matching model '' for studying such problems was first introduced by gale and shapley in 1962 in their seminal paper @xcite , in the context of college admissions and the marriage problem . yet , the original model is quite general and can be easily adapted for other two - sided markets , such as the well - known national resident matching program ( nrmp ) for assigning medical students to residency positions in us .    in gale and shapley s seminal paper , the college admissions problem is formulated as follows . let there be a set of colleges @xmath2 and a set of students @xmath3 . each college @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) has a quota @xmath6 , that denotes the maximum number of students it can admit . each student @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) can apply to any number of colleges , represented by a _ strict _ preference ( ordering ) over the @xmath9 colleges . each college also has a strict ranking for all students ( e.g. according to their test scores , interview performances or other criteria ) . a _ matching _ is simply an assignment of students to colleges such that each college accepts no more students than its quota , and each student is admitted to at most one college . for convenience , we use @xmath10 to denote a dummy college that takes all unmatched students . the college admissions problem can then be stated as the problem of designing an algorithm to arrive at a matching satisfying certain properties . the _ mechanism _ that implements the solution can be considered as a blackbox that takes the students and colleges preferences ( denoted by @xmath11 ) as input , and outputs the matching , as depicted in fig . [ mechanism_prev ] .    in @xcite , two desirable properties are defined : _ stability _ and _ optimality_. stability of a matching means that it is not possible to find a student and a college that are not matched to each other , but both prefer each other more than their current match . in college admissions , optimality means student - optimality . a stable matching is _ student - optimal _ if every student is at least as well - off as he / she is in any other stable matching . college - optimality can be defined in a similar way , but it is never used . gale and shapley proved that there always exists stable matchings . their proof is by construction ( using the deferred acceptance ( da ) algorithm in fig . [ mechanism_prev ] ) . in the special case when the colleges preferences are all based on student examination results , the da algorithm is equivalent to a procedure that sorts all students according to merit and letting students choose the most preferred college ( if quota still allows ) in order , starting from the best student . it is also shown in @xcite that the optimal stable matching is unique . +    in practice , it is reportedly quite common that the boston mechanism ( bm ) ( see * ? ? ? * ) is used instead . the basic procedures of bm are as follows : in the first round each college @xmath12 only considers students who listed it as their first choice and accepts these students one by one according to @xmath12 s own preference until the quota of the college is filled up . in the second round , only the remaining student without any offers and colleges still having unfilled quota are considered . each remaining college then considers students who listed it as the second choice and assigns offers to them one by one until the quota is exhausted . the process goes on round by round until all quota are filled up or all students are already accommodated . one major criticism concerning bm is its lack of stability . judged by classic matching theory , matching results under bm are far from stable and thus many students are `` incentivized '' to make complicated strategies when submitting their preference lists . in contrast , results under da are both stable and optimal for students . students can feel free to reveal their true preference lists . the transition from bm to da is therefore suggested in literature such as @xcite , which arguably would lead to significant efficiency gains for the whole community . however , our investigation of some practical college admissions systems shows that _ certain hybrid mechanism may be more acceptable in society from the perspective of colleges enrollment concerns as well as students personal interest_.    in this paper , we propose a generalized model for college admissions , which considers the tradeoff between students eligibility and interest by adjusting an additional parameter called _ reciprocating factor_. the larger the reciprocating factor is , the more would the interest factor counts when inspecting the applicants . bm and da are merely two special cases of the generalized model when setting different reciprocating factors . our model also extends the classic notion of stability and optimality by re - examining the formation of agents preferences . the remainder of the paper is structured as follows . in section [ sec : ca_hk ] we elaborate the actual college admissions system used in hong kong which inspires our formal model . in section [ sec : gene_model ] we proposes the generalized model for stable matching . some of the important properties of generalized model are presented and discussed extensively in section [ sec : property ] . section [ sec : simu ] compares the efficiency of generalized mechanism with the classic gale - shapley mechanism through simulation . we give some further discussion and related work in section [ sec : discussion ] and conclude in section [ sec : conclusion ] . the joint university programmes admissions system ( jupas ) is the central system for students to apply to the nine participating tertiary institutions in hong kong @xcite . in jupas each student can apply to at most 25 programmes in order of preference . these preferences are sub - divided and made known to the institutions in the form of five bands as shown in table 1 . .correspondence between applicants band order and actual choice order [ cols=""^,^"",options=""header "" , ]     the band order is made known to the programmes , however , the inner - band preferences are unrevealed . for example , in band a , the programme has no idea whether a student lists it as his / her first , second or third choice . after aggregating the preference lists from all the applicants , each programme will make a `` _ _ merit order list _ _ '' for its applicants in accordance with its criterion for selection . the rating criterion is determined independently by each programme : although many programmes would adopt a boston - like criterion which assigns band a students with highest priority , some programmes may also rate students only by their eligibility . some unpopular programmes tend to employ the latter strategy if they find most excellent students have listed it as band b or band c choices rather than band a.    finally , after all the _ _ merit order list__s and the applicants preference lists are sent to the jupas office , a central computer will automatically match the applicants with appropriate programmes . the matching process applies the classic _ student - proposing da algorithm _ to give the students the best offer he / she can possibly obtain . although the da algorithm is used in the last phase , the jupas mechanism as a whole is not equivalent to the classic _ gale - shapley student optimal mechanism _ in @xcite , where students would truthfully reveal their preference lists . applicants in jupas face a similar problem like students in bm : their band a choices would receive higher priority than choices in other bands , although there are no discrimination over the multiple inner - band choices . actually in jupas the applicants are always advised to choose appropriate programmes according to their interests as well as their qualifications @xcite . it is never a dominant strategy for students to always reveal their true preferences . therefore jupas may be interpreted as a hybrid of bm regarding inter - band discrimination and da regarding the algorithm applied in the final phase . the statement of `` gale - shapley student optimal stable mechanism is used in hong kong '' by @xcite is rather mis - informed and misleading : readers may falsely assume that applicants in hong kong could feel free to write down their true preferences , whereas in fact there is still room for students to manipulate their preference lists . a natural question is why not replace jupas with da as suggested in most literature . to answer it , we formulate a model in the next section in order to justify such selection of the policy makers for sticking with the hybrid mechanism we have mentioned in the previous section that programmes under jupas in hong kong have full right to determine how to rate students . two factors are the most important : student eligibility and band order . in practice , most programmes put heavy weight on academic performance in determining students eligibility which makes the examination scores a very decisive factor in admission . to simplify the analysis , we assume each applicant would attend a standard examination and gain a total score which ranges from zero to the maximum mark . for band order , higher preference ( like band _ a _ ) indicates that the applicant is more interested in the programme while ranking certain programme as band _ d _ or _ e _ infers the lack of interest . let @xmath13 denote the set of applicants , @xmath14 denote the set of programmes . each student @xmath15 achieves a total score @xmath16 $ ] in the standard examination where @xmath17 is the full mark of the examination . each programme @xmath18 has a quota @xmath19 . when student @xmath20 applies to programme @xmath12 as his / her @xmath21-th choice , @xmath20 will obtain a bonus score @xmath22 which would promote his / her position in programme @xmath12 s _ merit order list_. generally , the bonus score should be a strictly decreasing function over _ preference order / ranking _ @xmath21 . that is to say , the smaller @xmath21 is , the more bonus score it would bring . in practice , the programme director could make a corresponding table mapping each _ preference order _ to a certain bonus score for ease of reference . all applicants are then sorted by their _ merit scores _ in each programme , where student @xmath20 s _ merit score _ in programme @xmath12 is computed according to the following equation : @xmath23\ ] ] the first term denotes the original score achieved by @xmath20 and the second term is the bonus score for students interest in @xmath12 . in case of tie when students share the same merit score , @xmath24 serves as the tie - breaker and student with higher @xmath24 obtains higher priority . finally , if all terms are equal , we break the tie by a random lottery . we refer to @xmath25 as the _ reciprocating factor _ ( rf ) , a constant determined independently by each programme @xmath12 , reflecting its sensitivity towards applicant s _ preference order_. programmes with larger rf place more weight on applicants personal interests : other things being equal , students whose interests match with the programme are more favored . in the extreme case when @xmath26 of different programmes all equal to zero , the matching reduces to exactly the gale - shapley student optimal mechanism : preference order would not affect students positions in programmes ; in the contrary , when all @xmath26 are set to one , , there are actually an infinitely large amount of pairs @xmath25 and @xmath27 which can implement the boston mechanism , as long as it holds that for any @xmath12 and @xmath21 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 . we thank an anonymous referee for pointing this out . ] the matching works in the same way as the boston mechanism : the first choice gets the highest priority . for a general @xmath30 , say @xmath25 equals to @xmath31 , it means that programme @xmath12 would count @xmath32 of original score and @xmath33 of interest factor when evaluating the applicants . after calculating the merit score for each applicant , each programme could generate a _ reciprocating preference _ list by comparing merits scores of the applicants . these reciprocating preferences are then sent to the central college admissions system for further processing . the complete procedures can be illustrated in fig . [ mechanism_ext ] where students _ reciprocating preferences _ remain the same as their original preferences @xmath34 .     +    the reciprocating factor we propose in this paper gives programmes more flexibility in choosing a `` reasonable '' enrollment mechanism :    * for programmes which hope to stick to the traditional boston - like scheme , there will be no need for any change since by default @xmath26 is set to one ; * for programmes whose sole objective is to raise the average score of newly admitted students , setting @xmath26 to zero would be their favorite strategy ; * for other elastic programmes concerning the students interest as well , a suitable @xmath26 between zero and one needs to be determined according to each programme s own admission policy in each admission year . in last section we proposed the notion of _ reciprocating preference _ which can better reflect the selection criteria of individual programmes . it it the student with higher merit score , rather than higher original exam score , that is more favored by each programme . with the change of the interpretation of agents preferences , important concepts such as stability and optimality should also need to be re - defined _ from the perspective of reciprocating preferences_. we now give the formal definition as follows . a matching is _ _ r - stable _ _ if it is not possible to find a student and a college that are not matched to each other , but both _ prefer _ each other more than their current match when judged by their _ reciprocating preferences_.    a fundamental property of the generalized mechanism can be then presented as follows . [ theo : r_stable ] matching outcome under the generalized mechanism is _ r - stable_. moreover , it is _ optimal _ among all possible r - stable outcomes . the above theorem is easy to see by ignoring the preprocess phase in fig . [ mechanism_ext ] and focusing on the matching phase where da always generates stable and optimal matching given any preference lists . therefore from the perspective of reciprocating preferences , the matching outcome under jupas - like hybrid mechanism is still stable and optimal among all stable outcomes . since bm is merely an extreme case of the generalized mechanism , we may easily get the following corollary through property [ theo : r_stable ] .    the boston mechanism , known to be unstable by classic matching theory ( see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , is actually r - stable with regard to colleges reciprocating preferences .    in previous analysis , we assume all students would submit their true preferences . however , this assumption is unrealistic , especially in practical college admissions system like jupas where strategic behaviors is actually quite common . we now show some key results for strategy analysis as follows . [ theo : no_truthful_mech ] college admissions mechanism like jupas is not strategy - proof in general . the exceptions are when all the programmes reciprocating factors are zero , it is the dominant strategy for students to reveal their true preferences . we defer the detailed proof to appendix [ proof : no_truthful_mech ] . when all programmes reciprocating factors are zero , the generalized model reduces to the classic gale - shapley student - optimal mechanism which is strategy - proof for students ( see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? generally , when most programmes have positive reciprocating factors , students would act strategically : students with relatively lower examination scores may try to avoid some popular programmes where there would be lots of competitors with higher scores , and list those unpopular ones as their top choices instead in order to obtain more bonus scores there and increase the chances for admission . it is worth pointing out that even though the generalized model is not strategy - proof , it does not imply that students would always have strong incentive to strategize . whether applicants strategies can work or not depends on how much information they know about other students behaviors . for example , suppose there are five students @xmath35 and @xmath36 gets the lowest exam score ; there are two programmes @xmath37 and @xmath38 , both with reciprocating factors @xmath39 and quota @xmath40 . if the preferences of students are strongly _ correlated _ , say all students consent that @xmath37 is better than @xmath38 , @xmath36 may try to avoid the popular programme @xmath37 and list @xmath38 as the first choice to get higher priority . otherwise , @xmath36 may end up with no offers at all . however , if students preferences are totally _ uncorrelated _ , which means different students hold independent views to the programmes , @xmath36 may know little about others preferences . in this scenario telling truth might be the best choice of students . the following property state this observation formally . [ theo : bayes_ne ] suppose all programmes have equal quota and their reciprocating factors are independently drawn from a uniform distribution over any range @xmath41 $ ] ( @xmath42 ) . besides , the preferences of all students are independently drawn from a uniform distribution over the set of all possible rank orderings ( i.e. , the uncorrelated environment ) . then , truth - telling is a bayesian nash equilibrium for each student under the generalized matching mechanism .    for readability , we defer the detailed proof to appendix [ proof : bayes_ne ] .    property [ theo : bayes_ne ] shows that students would be forced to reveal their true preferences if they have no exact knowledge of other students realized preferences except the distribution . this is one extreme case with totally uncorrelated preferences . at the other extreme is the totally correlated case where students have complete information of other students true preferences . property [ theo : dominated ] characterizes the possibilities of students strategies in the latter scenario .    [ theo : dominated ] suppose all students have the same preference over colleges . besides , this is a common knowledge among all students . let the quota of their favorite college be @xmath43 . then truth - telling is a _ dominated strategy _ for all students except the top @xmath43 students ranked according to their scores . we present the proof in appendix [ proof : dominated ] .    in practice , students can only have partial knowledge to other students submitted preferences , probably through the history of admission data in each individual programme . besides , students need to estimate the value of @xmath25 in each programme and carefully choose programmes they make strategy on since promoting preference in purpose for programmes which run da - like mechanism ( i.e. , @xmath26 is slightly above zero ) may have little effect in raising their merit scores in those programmes . on the other hand , in each admission year programmes would take lessons from admission outcomes of the previous year and adjust their policy on how to determine parameters like @xmath26 and @xmath44 . these interactions form a complicated extensive - form game which may be repeated infinitely at the time granularity of each admission year . this leaves a bunch of open questions to be settled such as : whether there are any equilibrium strategies and if they do exist , would the matching outcomes converge to any of these equilibrium states after finite rounds of games year by year .    until now we have focused on students strategies in submitting preferences and assumed that college programmes would reveal their reciprocating factors nonstrategically . while it seems intractable to characterize the dynamic game in the long run , we do obtain some analytical result for the single shot game in one particular admission year . the following property helps relieve our concerns of programmes strategies so that we may refocus on the manipulations from applicants side . [ theo : college_truth ] suppose after students submit their preferences , each college @xmath12 determines its true values of @xmath25 and @xmath22 independently . then revealing @xmath25 and @xmath22 truthfully would be the dominant strategy for any programme @xmath45 in the _ ex post _ perspective . we present the proof in appendix [ proof : college_truth ] . here we take the ex post perspective may not hold since colleges would take students reaction into consideration before making any decisions . it would be an interesting future work for analyzing the complicated interactions from the ex ante perspective . ] since when colleges make their strategies , students preferences are already submitted and fixed . in practice , when the admission authority evaluate the matching outcome each year , they can only conduct it based on the submitted preference lists of students . it would be expensive ( or even impossible ) to obtain the true preferences of all applicants via survey or other methods . thus for the single shot game , colleges would passively reveal their true parameters once they receive applicants preference lists . in this section we have shown some fundamental properties of the generalized mechanism . to further investigate the degree of satisfaction participants perceive under different mechanisms , we implement simulations and present the social welfare results different mechanisms induce in the next section . to define and compare social welfare under different matching outcomes , we need to quantify the utility of each participant / agent in the mechanism first .    denoted by @xmath46 the set of students and @xmath14 the set of colleges . @xmath47 is the set of all participants and @xmath48 is the set of all possible matching outcomes . for any agent @xmath49 , let @xmath50 be the reciprocating preference list is students original preference . ] of @xmath51 and @xmath52 be the set of participants matched to @xmath51 under certain outcome @xmath53 .    for each agent @xmath54 , denote integer @xmath55 as the ranking agent @xmath56 appears in @xmath51 s preference list @xmath50 . for example , @xmath57 means that @xmath56 is the first choice in @xmath51 s preference list . we use @xmath58 to denote the unmatched case . we assume that agent @xmath51 s utility is additive and only determined by the orders of the matching set in the preference list , which can be written as , @xmath59 where @xmath60 is non - increasing as integer @xmath61 increases . intuitively , it means that higher order ( smaller @xmath21 ) would generate higher degree of satisfaction for agent @xmath51 . the aggregate utility of students ( or colleges ) under outcome @xmath62 is then : @xmath63    the _ social welfare _ is defined as the aggregate utility of all participants in the mechanism , which can be written as follows : @xmath64    we say matching outcome @xmath65 is more _ efficient _ than @xmath66 if : @xmath67    we further say mechanism @xmath68 is more _ efficient _ than @xmath69 if @xmath70 can always induce a more efficient matching outcome than @xmath69 under any possible preference lists of agents . generally speaking , an outcome would be more efficient if it induces higher ranked matching . in the context of college admissions , a mechanism which generates more first - choice matching for students is likely to be more efficient . suppose there are @xmath71 students and @xmath72 colleges with just one quota in each college . we assume the utility of each agent is as follows , @xmath73 thus a first - ranked matching would bring in utility of @xmath71 for either students or colleges . notice that the efficiency upper bound is @xmath74 since there are at most five pairs of students and colleges matched with each other . the preference lists of students are generated as follows :    student @xmath20 evaluates each college @xmath12 by this formulae , @xmath75\ ] ] where @xmath76 denotes the social reputation of each college and @xmath77 denotes the individual preference of student @xmath20 , which is independently drawn from uniform distribution over @xmath78 $ ] . the factor @xmath79 denotes the _ degree of correlation _ for students preferences . can be also regarded as a signal implying how much information students may know about other students preferences . if @xmath80 , each student has complete information to others preferences since they share exactly the same opinion over colleges . if @xmath81 , each student has independent opinion over colleges and thus has no posterior knowledge on others preferences . in general , students individual opinion would be more or less be affected by the common social opinion and each of them would have partial knowledge to other students preferences . ] the preference list @xmath34 can therefore be deduced by comparing the value of @xmath82 for different @xmath12 , i.e. , @xmath20 prefers @xmath37 to @xmath38 if @xmath83 . the preference lists of colleges are generated as follows :    college @xmath12 evaluates each student @xmath20 by this formulae , @xmath84 where @xmath85 if @xmath12 is the @xmath21-th choice in @xmath34 . @xmath24 is the exam score of student @xmath20 , which is independently drawn from uniform distribution over @xmath78 $ ] . we generate the reciprocating factor @xmath25 for each college @xmath12 by the following distribution : @xmath86    the preference list @xmath87 can then be inferred by comparing the value of @xmath88 for different @xmath20 . in case of ties , namely , @xmath89 , @xmath90 is favored over @xmath91 if @xmath92 .      after generating the reciprocating preference lists for both sides , the matching outcome can be obtained by applying the student - proposing da algorithm . we then calculate the social welfare under the matching outcome . in the simulation , we use @xmath93 $ ] , with a step size of @xmath94 . for each particular @xmath79 , we repeat the process of preference generation for @xmath95 times and compute the average values of aggregate utility and social welfare . for comparison , we also calculate the average social welfare under pure gs mechanism , which can be easily implemented by just setting @xmath96 for each college @xmath12 in the distribution of reciprocating factors . as certain manipulation to the true preferences , then our comparison of social welfare of da and hybrid mechanism should have been based on the same ( true ) preferences of colleges . since the latter kind of comparison is already fully covered by property [ theo : college_truth ] theoretically , we feel that there would be no need to conduct further simulations on it ( which would not produce any `` surprising '' results beyond theory ) . ] [ uti_student ] presents the simulation results for aggregate utility of students over different degrees of preference correlation . as we can see , the expected aggregate utilities under both mechanisms decrease as @xmath79 increases from zero to one . the upper bound of @xmath97 is 50 since there are at most five students who can receive their first - choice offers from colleges . when @xmath79 is small ( less than around @xmath98 ) , we can achieve about @xmath99 and @xmath100 of the upper bound under the jupas - like hybrid mechanism and the pure gale - shapley ( gs ) student optimal mechanism respectively . as @xmath79 rises , the preference list of each student becomes more and more similar and there are more collision between students interest in colleges . when @xmath79 is large enough ( greater than @xmath101 ) , the pre - determined social reputation of each college becomes the dominant factor in forming the preference lists of students . that is to say , @xmath102 would be @xmath103 for all students . thus college @xmath37 would always bring utility of @xmath71 to the student community , @xmath38 brings @xmath104 and so on , which forms this lower bound of @xmath105 . we also notice in fig . [ uti_student ] that in general @xmath97 is slightly larger under the hybrid mechanism than under the gs mechanism . this result helps ease the concern that the jupas - like mechanism would hurt the interest of student community as a whole . the intuition is that while some students with higher exam scores may get worse in the hybrid mechanism , other students with slightly lower scores would have more chances to enter the programmes / colleges in which they are really interested . [ uti_college ] shows the result for aggregate utility of colleges . in the pure gs mechanism , since preferences of colleges are only determined by the exam scores of students , all colleges would share exactly the same preference list over students . therefore the student with the highest score would always bring utility of @xmath71 to the college side , the student with the second highest score brings @xmath104 and so on . that is why @xmath106 would be always equal to @xmath107 under the gs mechanism . the upper bound of @xmath106 is also 50 , which occurs only if all five colleges realize their first choices . as shown in the figure , we can achieve about @xmath108 of the upper bound under the jupas - like hybrid mechanism when @xmath109 $ ] . as students preferences become more similar , colleges tend to have similar reciprocating preference , which means more conflict would occur among different colleges . thus as @xmath79 continues increasing from about @xmath110 , the aggregate utility of colleges would decrease rapidly . when @xmath79 is large enough ( greater than @xmath101 ) , all colleges would share the same preference over students . thus student with the highest score would always bring utility of @xmath71 to colleges , student with the second highest score brings @xmath104 and so on , which forms the lower bound of @xmath111 . +    the expected social welfare under different values of @xmath79 is shown in fig . [ social_welfare ] . in the same way , we obtain the upper bound of social welfare as @xmath112 . when @xmath79 is small ( less than @xmath113 ) and students have various preferences over colleges , we achieve about @xmath108 and @xmath114 of the upper bound under the hybrid mechanism and the gs mechanism respectively . when @xmath79 approaches to one and students share common opinion on colleges , the ratio would both decrease to @xmath32 . this comparative result of social welfare helps justify the implementation of jupas - like mechanism in college admissions . the transfer from the hybrid mechanism to the gs mechanism can only achieve the well - known incentive compatible property at the cost of potentially significant loss of efficiency , especially when students have independent opinions on different colleges . as we have mentioned in the last section , when students preferences become more correlated , it would be easier for strategic students to manipulate the matching results successfully . thus in the following simulation we use @xmath80 as an example to illustrate the effect of possible strategies of students . when considering @xmath80 , the true preferences of students are all the same as @xmath115 . we assume there are two types of students : the truthful ones and the strategic ones . the truthful students would always submit their true preferences while the strategic students are likely to manipulate their submitted preference lists based on the information they already collect . in our simulation setting , the key information strategic students may infer is the reciprocating factor of each college . notice that in practical college admissions mechanism like jupas , students would know their own examination scores and overall performances of other students before submitting their applications . here in the simulation we assume the strategic students would know exactly their score ranking out of all students . then one possible strategy would be as follows :    @xmath116    for student with the highest score , since he / she can be assured to get into @xmath37 , there is no need to strategize . for other students , since @xmath37 is already occupied , they can shield their first choice and list @xmath37 as their last choice . thus the student would manipulate his / her first and second choice as @xmath117 and @xmath118 in order to obtain better opportunity . [ fig : stu_gain_compare_random_alpha ] shows the expected utility of students of either type . since the aggregate utility of all ten students are always @xmath119 under @xmath80 , the average utility per student would be @xmath120 when there are no strategic students , which serves as the benchmark for evaluating the effectiveness of possible strategies . as we see , when there are only one strategic student , strategy @xmath121 would bring expected utility of @xmath122 , much more than the benchmark utility of @xmath120 when all students act truthfully . as the number of strategic students increases , the expected utility per strategic student would decrease gradually , but still remain larger than @xmath120 . this result validates the effectiveness of the proposed strategy @xmath121 under our simulation setting . the existence of strategic students would make the students who act truthfully worse - off , however , from the figure we see this side - effect is bounded as the number of strategic students increase . even when all other students act strategically , the remaining truthful student could still achieve about @xmath100 of the benchmark utility . [ fig : uti_if_strategy_random_alpha ] presents the aggregate utility of both sides when strategic students exist . the aggregate utility of students remains @xmath119 since all students share the same preference list as @xmath123 . the aggregate utility of colleges ( the square - marked line ) is calculated based on the _ submitted _ preference lists of students , since in practice the true preferences of students are unrevealed to the public . when there are no strategic students , all students submit the same preference list . thus all colleges would share exactly the same reciprocating preference over students , ordered solely by the scores of students . this explains @xmath124 when the number of strategic students is zero since student with the highest score always brings utility of @xmath71 to colleges , student with the second highest score brings @xmath104 and so on . as there are more strategic students , colleges other than @xmath37 would probably enroll students with higher merit scores since strategic students list colleges as more favored choices . thus the aggregate utility of colleges based on the submitted preferences would increase .    for comparison , we also show the aggregate utility of colleges based on the _ true _ preferences of students in the asterisk - marked line . in our setting of @xmath80 , the true reciprocating preferences of colleges would be all the same , ranking the students according to their exam scores . when all students tell truth or all apply strategy @xmath121 , @xmath37 would enroll the student with the highest score , @xmath38 gets the student with the second highest score and so on . thus @xmath125 . in other cases , some strategic students with lower scores may receive better offer than they could achieve when telling truth . for instance , @xmath118 may not receive the student with the fifth - highest score as anticipated . therefore the aggregate utility of colleges would decrease from the initial value of @xmath119 . however , this adverse effect is bounded as seen from fig . [ fig : uti_if_strategy_random_alpha ] , because when there are too many strategic students in the system , it would be difficult for strategic students with very low scores to achieve better matching outcome . [ whole_fig : diff_beta ] - show the expected utility each particular student gains under _ different degrees of preference correlation_. the horizontal axis denotes the score ranking of student , and each point drawn in the figure is the average value for one thousand iterations . the possible strategy students could make is strategy @xmath121 . we assume there is only one student behaving strategically while the rest of students would reveal their true preferences . from the figures we see that for the top one student , he / she would always achieve utility of ten since according to strategy @xmath121 he / she would just act truthfully and can always get the first choice . [ whole_fig : diff_beta ] verifies that truth - telling is an equilibrium strategy when students preference are totally uncorrelated : the students would not be better off when deviating unilaterally from the equilibrium , whereas under @xmath80 , truth - telling would be dominated by the strategy @xmath121 , as shown in fig . [ whole_fig : diff_beta ] . for general value of @xmath126 , the students with higher ranking would tend to act truthfully while the students with lower ranking tend to behave strategically by choosing the less famous colleges . as the preferences of students becomes more correlated , more students would have incentive to make certain strategy rather than acting truthfully .     +   + * pros and cons regarding da and the generalized mechanism * we have shown that under complete information , students do have strong incentive to lie ; on the contrary , in the absence of any posterior knowledge , truth - telling is still the ne of the generalized mechanism . in the simulation , @xmath79 serves as an indicator of how much information each student may know about others preferences . we would like to highlight through this paper the debate whether college side would all agree on applying da so as to achieve strategy - proofness property , or some colleges would be willing to enroll students with higher interests in risk of potential manipulation . our generalized model just establishes a framework to admit such tradeoff between gain in efficiency and risk in truthfulness , and gives each college the freedom to adjust their policy through rf . it is worth noting that the proposed model does not intend to repel the current trend of practice of da . da is essentially encompassed in our framework and we just give it a second thought from the perspective of individual college . to further understand the potential downside of da , let us consider the following scenario : if da is enforced in all participating programs of jupas , for those less popular programmes , lots of students with lower scores but more interest would be wiped out , and instead most quota of these programmes would be occupied by students with higher scores but less interest ( their scores are not high enough to get into popular programmes which they listed as top choices , so finally end up with an offer from bottom choices ) . one conventional policy in hong kong s universities is that students are allowed to switch programme inside the university in the end of the first year in case students feel the current programme is not suitable for themselves after one year s study . in this case most unsatisfied students enrolled by these unpopular programmes would apply to change . if approving most of these applications , those programmes may suffer from high vacancy rate . however , if rejecting most of them , the majority of students in the programme would feel unsatisfactory . this becomes a dilemma for the unpopular programmes . the main objective of da is to achieve stability ; however , it may end up with `` unstable '' outcomes in the long run . this explanation helps rationalize the current selection of hybrid manner in jupas rather than hasty replacement with da . unfortunately , these concerns and debates from the college side are largely ignored in existing literature .    * extension to marriage problem * the generalization of college admissions mechanism also applies to the classic stable marriage problem discussed in the original paper of @xcite . consider the situation when a woman faces two men proposals and has no clear idea which one she strictly prefers . technically , we call there exists a _ tie _ in the woman s preference list . roughly speaking , the existing literature mainly provides two solutions to deal with marriage problem with tie . a quick solution is just requiring the woman to flip a coin to produce a strict preference list so that the previous mechanism could be applied immediately . the other solution concerns how to find the optimal matching outcome among all these artificial tie - breaking possibilities , for instance , the polynomial - time stable improvement cycles algorithm raised in @xcite . however , suppose the woman has the wish : `` i ll choose the man who loves me most ! '' yet the fact is that the first man has listed her as the first choice while the second man listed this woman as his last choice and was rejected by every other women in the previous rounds , assuming men - proposing da algorithm @xcite applied here . obviously a `` reasonable '' matching mechanism should respect each participating agent wish and therefore always match the first man with the woman . however , existing matching mechanisms provide no channel for agents to express such kind of reciprocating preferences , although mutual appreciation is a very natural and common factor in determining marriage mates . our generalized model can be easily carried over to the above scenario . by analogy , we can define the _ merit score _ of man @xmath9 in woman @xmath127 as follows : and @xmath127 in the equation , we may generate the merit score of woman @xmath127 in man @xmath9 . ] @xmath128\ ] ] where @xmath129 is the initial rating score of @xmath9 in @xmath127 ; @xmath21 is an integer denoting @xmath127 s position in @xmath9 s initial preference list and @xmath130 is the bonus score which is decreasing over @xmath21 , i.e. , the smaller @xmath21 is , the more bonus score the man can achieve ; @xmath131 is the reciprocating factor of the woman , denoting @xmath127 s sensitivity to other men s evaluation to herself . if @xmath131 is set to zero , which is equivalent to the classic model where a woman only believes her own feeling and judgement conversely , if @xmath131 equals to one , woman @xmath127 is extremely sensitive to men opinions on her and hopes to match with the one who loves her most . in general a woman may set @xmath131 between zero and one to strike a balance between her initial feeling and men s appraisal to her . choosing a mate with mutual appreciation seems more `` reasonable '' and natural in practical marriage . the parameter of _ reciprocating factor _ provides an opportunity for agents to more fully express their wishes or perceived payoff than in the classic model . finally by comparing the _ merit scores _ for different men , we can reproduce the preference list of @xmath127 . in case of tie in merit scores , we resort to original score for tie breaking .    * related work * some recent developments in matching theory share our concerns that the transition from the boston mechanism to the gs mechanism is not problem - free and object to the hasty rejection of the boston mechanism . one main research direction is the analysis of efficiency in school choice ( sc ) setting where schools do not have _ strict _ preferences over students and have to largely rely on _ random lotteries _ to determine their preferences . abdulkadirolu , che and yasuda first brought up the uncertainty factor of lotteries into efficiency consideration ( see * ? ? ? they showed an elegant example when students share identical ordinal preference but differ in preference intensities , the boston mechanism can dominate the gs mechanism in terms of _ expected _ cardinal efficiency . a new choice - augmented deferred acceptance ( cada ) mechanism was proposed accordingly which supports a greater scope of efficiency than the pure gs mechanism ( see * ? ? ? the same authors further generalized the single example into a `` baseline model '' where students have common ordinal preferences and schools have no priorities in @xcite . besides , @xcite showed that the above analytical results could extend to more realistic cases such as weak priorities by simulation . featherstone and niederle then classified the efficiency issue in sc into three categories ( see * ? ? ? * ) :    ex post : : :    each student knows preferences of other students and lottery results    in each school . the matching outcome as well as the efficiency are    both deterministic . interim : : :    students know preferences of other students but remain unknown to the    lottery results , i.e. , we would investigate the efficiency before the    lotteries are drawn . the distribution of lottery results would induce    an expected , other than deterministic , value of efficiency . ex ante : : :    students only know the distribution of other students preferences and    still remain ignorant of lottery results . the authors concluded in the same paper that , when student preferences are uniformly distributed and schools are completely symmetric , the boston mechanism can first - order stochastically dominate the gs mechanism in terms of _ ex ante _ efficiency , both in theory and in the laboratory . following the efficiency classification above , results in @xcite would all fall into the _ interim _ viewpoint with highly _ correlated _ student preferences , which complements the conclusion in @xcite under _ independent _ student preferences . although sharing the same caution against a hasty replacement of the boston mechanism , our paper stands distinct from these above works in several aspects :    * one _ key _ assumption for the above works is the _ weak _ or even no priorities in schools such that lotteries are largely relied upon in schools in order to break the tie . it is this `` randomness '' that causes the potential _ ex ante _ efficiency loss of the gs mechanism . however , in practical ca context where students scores rather than the random lotteries play the decisive role in admissions , the above assumption would no longer hold , so would the corresponding conclusions . * our paper follows a distinctive and unique research direction and shows that even when the priorities in schools are _ strict _ , boston still exhibits some prominent properties such as respecting the interests of applicants . the sociological consideration of agents preferences has been largely ignored in previous research of college admissions system .    in terms of interdependent preferences , we notice a recent work of @xcite proposing `` interdependent values '' in two - sided matching which can be regarded as a complementary notion to our reciprocating preferences . in @xcite the authors argue that a college @xmath12 s evaluation of a student @xmath20 could be affected by ( or depend on ) other colleges evaluation to this student @xmath20 , while we consider the scenario where @xmath20 s value to @xmath12 is dependent on @xmath12 s value to @xmath20 . in this paper we propose a generalized matching mechanism which can incorporate both bm and da . inspired by a practical college admissions system , i.e. , jupas in hong kong , we propose a common parameter , namely _ reciprocating factor _ ( or @xmath26 ) , for the generalized matching model . this parameter serves as a bridge between bm and da : when all @xmath26 are set to zero , the matching mechanism would be equivalent to pure bm ; when all @xmath26 equal to one , the matching mechanism reduces to pure da . practical systems like jupas can be regarded as a hybrid of bm and da with reciprocating factor between zero and one . in the context of college admissions , reciprocating factor is of practical significance for programmes to achieve the tradeoff between eligibility and real interest of enrolled students . we have discussed the advantage and disadvantage of da and the generalized mechanism extensively and highlighted the debate from the perspective of colleges side . these potential concerns and doubts from colleges would help justify the current selection of hybrid system in hong kong .    with regard to future works , our paper could be further improved and extended in several directions :    1 . one major open question regarding the generalized mechanism is how history data of admission may affect the strategies and choices of current applicants . are there any equilibria for this extensive - form game that all participants would conform to ? how would their behaviors in the system evolve in the long run ? we hope that these strategic issues can be tackled in the future . 2 .   how the reciprocating factors of colleges are distributed is another interesting direction which we have not yet investigated in details . @xcite showed that both popular and unpopular colleges have motives of giving preferential treatment to applicants who rank them as top choices . does this imply that different colleges tend to have similar reciprocating factors in practice ? this question may not be addressed immediately since these `` inside '' information of colleges is typically inaccessible to the public . we have showed some positive results of the hybrid system through simulation , however , simulation alone is insufficient to cover all complicated strategies of students . as the future work , we plan to design some lab experiments which would involve real participants to play and learn during the game . we believe that these empirical results would provide more evidence and insight for supporting and spreading the adoption of hybrid system like jupas in hong kong . it is easy to see that when all rf are zero , the generalized mechanism reduces to da which is strategy - proof . to prove a mechanism is non - truthful in general , we just need to find one counter - example for any given rf which are not all zero . suppose all colleges have zero rf except college @xmath12 with positive @xmath25 . besides , @xmath12 has quota for only one student . let @xmath25 equal to any small @xmath132 . suppose that there are two students @xmath90 and @xmath91 . @xmath90 achieves a higher score @xmath133 and @xmath12 is his / her second choice school ; @xmath91 gets a lower score @xmath134 but lists @xmath12 as his / her first choice . the merit score of @xmath91 in @xmath12 is then : @xmath135 if telling truth , @xmath90 s merit score in @xmath12 would be : @xmath136 by letting @xmath137 , we have the condition when @xmath12 prefers @xmath91 to @xmath90 : @xmath138 since @xmath139 and @xmath27 is a ( strictly ) decreasing function of choice order , we have @xmath140 . we further assume that @xmath90 knows he / she would not succeed in his / her first choice college , thus the best he / she can achieve is getting into college @xmath12 . by listing @xmath12 as the first choice , @xmath90 would obtain a higher merit score in @xmath12 : @xmath141 which is always larger than @xmath142 .          for student @xmath20 , let @xmath11 be its preference list where college @xmath12 is ranked @xmath21-th . consider a new preference list @xmath144 of @xmath20 which exchanges the @xmath21-th choice with the @xmath56-th ( @xmath145 ) choice college . a mechanism is called _ rank monotonic _ if the probability of @xmath20 being matched to @xmath12 is weakly higher under @xmath144 than under @xmath11 no matter how preferences and reciprocating factors are distributed . consider the notation in the previous definition . also consider any state of the matching system ( i.e. , any possible scores , submitted preferences of students and rf of colleges ) where student @xmath20 submits @xmath11 and is matched to college @xmath12 . in this state , student @xmath20 is rejected by every college prior to its @xmath21-th choice in @xmath11 , and after @xmath12 enrolls @xmath20 , no other students can drive @xmath20 out of @xmath12 s quota in later rounds . mathematically , suppose @xmath12 has quota @xmath43 and @xmath20 is in the @xmath51-th position in @xmath12 s merit order list , then there will be at most @xmath146 students with higher position than @xmath20 in @xmath12 s list . hence , if student @xmath20 had instead submitted @xmath144 , in the same state of the system , he also would have been rejected by every college prior to its @xmath56-th choice in @xmath144 . considering @xmath12 s merit order list , student @xmath20 can only get promoted since it lists @xmath12 as higher choice in @xmath144 . after getting into @xmath12 in the @xmath56-th round , since preferences of all other students and colleges remains the same as under @xmath11 , there will also be at most @xmath146 students with higher position than @xmath20 in @xmath12 s new list . so @xmath20 can guarantee its admission to @xmath12 . this implies that the probability of student @xmath20 being matched to college @xmath12 is weakly larger when it submits @xmath144 instead of @xmath11 . if the probability of student @xmath20 being matched to its @xmath51-th choice college is independent of its submitted preference list , we say that its preference revelation problem exhibits _ college anonymity_.    [ lemma : college_anonym ] suppose there are @xmath9 colleges with quota @xmath43 and @xmath147 students . if the submitted preferences of all students other than @xmath20 , as well as the reciprocating factors of colleges are uniformly distributed , then the preference revelation problem of student @xmath20 exhibits _ college anonymity_.    let student @xmath20 submit preference list @xmath34 where @xmath148 is its @xmath51-th choice college in list @xmath34 . denoted by @xmath149 other student s preferences and @xmath150 the vector of each college s reciprocating factor . let @xmath151 be the set of all possible @xmath149 . and @xmath152^m$ ] is the @xmath9-dimensional space containing all possible values of @xmath153 . for each particular @xmath154 , denoted by @xmath155 the region of @xmath153 in which @xmath20 is matched to its @xmath51-th choice under @xmath156 . then the probability of @xmath20 being matched to its @xmath51-th choice can be denoted as : @xmath157    now let student @xmath20 submit a different preference list @xmath158 . this induces a permutation mapping @xmath159 from the set of colleges index @xmath160 to itself which is defined as follows : for any college @xmath161 @xmath162 , let @xmath163 be its ranking in list @xmath34 , then the image value @xmath164 is the index of college which is ranked @xmath163 in list @xmath158 . by a slight abuse of notation , we express this permutation as @xmath165 for conciseness .    for each @xmath166 , by symmetry , we know that under + @xmath167 , student @xmath20 would still be matched to its @xmath51-th choice college in @xmath158 . since @xmath159 is a one - to - one mapping , by this way of transformation we would have listed all the possibility for the matching . thus the probability of @xmath20 being matched to its @xmath51-th choice in @xmath158 can be denoted as : @xmath168 since preference list is uniformly drawn , we have @xmath169 . the integral parts in equation ( [ eqn : prob_i ] ) and ( [ eqn : prob_i_prime ] ) are equivalent since it is just a simple substitution of the variables , i.e. , they both equal to the following expression : @xmath170      we still use @xmath172 to denote the probability of @xmath20 being matched to its @xmath51-th choice college . combining the conclusion in lemma [ lemma : rank_mono ] and lemma [ lemma : college_anonym ] , we have that @xmath173 for @xmath174 . the best response in this case is clearly to put the favorite school in the first place , the second most favorite one in the second place and so on . thus truth - telling would be the best response for students . suppose there are @xmath9 colleges and @xmath147 students . without loss of generality , we assume that all students share the same preference list : @xmath175 . let the quota of their favorite college @xmath37 be @xmath43 and reciprocating factor of @xmath37 is @xmath176 .    by listing @xmath37 as their first choice , the top @xmath43 students judged by score ( denoted by @xmath177 with @xmath178 ) would still occupy the top @xmath43 vacancies in @xmath37 s merit score list . this can be easily seen by the composition of merit score : @xmath179 for any other student @xmath7 ( @xmath180 ) listing @xmath37 as @xmath51-th choice , its merit score would be smaller than @xmath181 since @xmath182 and @xmath183 .      for the rest students , since all the quota of @xmath37 is filled up , they would have no incentive to still list @xmath37 as their first choice . to prove that truth - telling ( denoted by @xmath184 ) is a dominated strategy , we only need to find one particular strategy which dominates @xmath185 . we now focus on one of such strategies which requires students to always submit @xmath186 ( denoted by @xmath121 ) . let @xmath20 be any of these remaining students and the utility of @xmath20 be @xmath187 when it is matched with @xmath4 ( @xmath188 ) . denoted by @xmath172 the probability of @xmath20 being matched with @xmath4 under @xmath184 and @xmath189 the same probability under @xmath121 ( notice that @xmath190 and @xmath191 would be zero since @xmath37 s quota has already been occupied ) . then the expected utility under @xmath184 would be no more than that under @xmath121 since : @xmath192 according to lemma [ lemma : rank_mono ] , the probability of @xmath20 being matched with @xmath4 ( @xmath193 ) would be higher under @xmath121 since @xmath4 s position gets promoted compared with @xmath184 . thus @xmath194 and the inequality above holds . this gives the proof that truth - telling is a dominated strategy .      for analyzing colleges strategies , we borrow the idea of _ dropping strategies _ and _ rejection chains algorithm _ from @xcite and show that it is impossible for colleges to find an effective dropping strategy and manipulate the matching successfully . thus the best matching colleges may achieve is via revealing their true preferences ( i.e. , their merit order lists ) .    to complete our proof , we first briefly restate some basic definitions and lemmas in @xcite . let @xmath87 be the reciprocating preference of college @xmath12 obtained through its true @xmath25 and @xmath22 . @xmath90 and @xmath91 are two students applying to college @xmath12 . [ lemma : dropping ] _ ( dropping strategies are exhaustive ) _ : if under certain strategy @xmath195 the mechanism produces matching outcome @xmath201 , then there must exist a dropping strategy of college @xmath12 that produces a matching that @xmath12 weakly prefers to @xmath201 according to its true preference @xmath87 .    the detailed proof can be found in appendix b of @xcite . lemma [ lemma : dropping ] implies that if there exists any successful strategy @xmath195 for college @xmath12 ( by manipulating its @xmath25 and @xmath22 ) , we can always find a dropping strategy which achieves at least the same improvement . that is to say , if we can prove that for every dropping strategy , we can not make college @xmath12 better off , then @xmath12 would be forced to act truthfully .    for any dropping strategies , the `` dropped '' students in @xmath12 would re - apply to other colleges in the student - proposing da algorithm , which would cause a chain of rejection and acceptance in the subsequent stages . this can be analyzed in details through the so - called _ rejection chains _ algorithm as follows .            1 . if @xmath207 , * return * ; 2 .   otherwise , let @xmath20 be the least preferred student by @xmath12 among @xmath208 , and let @xmath209 . 3 .   iterate the following steps @xmath20 continues to apply : 1 . if @xmath20 has already applied to every college in @xmath34 , * go to * begin ; 2 . otherwise , let @xmath210 be the most preferred college of @xmath20 among those which @xmath20 has not yet applied . if @xmath211 , set @xmath212 then * return * ; 2 . acceptance and/or rejection : 1 . if @xmath210 has no vacant position and prefers each of its current mates to @xmath20 , then @xmath210 rejects @xmath20 , * go to * step 3 . otherwise , @xmath210 accepts @xmath20 . if @xmath210 has a vacant position , * go to * begin ; otherwise , @xmath210 rejects the least preferred student among those who were matched to @xmath210 . let this rejected student be @xmath20 then * go to * step 3 ;            therefore the proof can be now boiled down to answer whether algorithm 1 can possibly return to @xmath12 after applying any dropping strategy . this is summarized in the following lemma as the final step of proof . assuming that algorithm 1 returns to @xmath12 with strictly better @xmath203 after finite steps of iterations . by retrieving the running process of algorithm 1 , we would be able to reconstruct a complete chain of rejection and acceptance as follows ( denote @xmath218 ) : @xmath219 the above chain reflects the latest iteration before algorithm 1 returns with @xmath216 . it starts from @xmath37 ( i.e. , @xmath12 ) rejecting @xmath90 , then @xmath90 applied to @xmath38 following its own preference @xmath220 ; after comparing @xmath90 and @xmath91 , @xmath38 decided to accept @xmath90 and reject @xmath91 ; then @xmath91 started its new application and so on . finally , @xmath221 was rejected by @xmath222 and applied to @xmath223 ( i.e. , @xmath12 ) , which satisfies the stopping condition of algorithm 1 with @xmath216 .    by inspecting the behavior of @xmath38 , we know that @xmath91 applied to it earlier than @xmath90 ( which implies @xmath91 obtained higher bonus score than @xmath90 in @xmath38 ) but is still less favored by @xmath38 . the only explanation for this phenomenon is that @xmath90 achieved strictly better exam score than @xmath91 , i.e. , @xmath92 . this rule also applies to other colleges in this chain . in the end , since we suppose @xmath12 achieves better matching through the dropping strategy , @xmath221 is regarded better than @xmath90 for @xmath12 , which implies that @xmath224 . in summary , we have : @xmath225 by adding the left side and right side of those inequations , we derive @xmath226 , an apparent contradiction !                          dtting , p. , henzinger , m. , weber , i. , 2010 . sponsored search , market equilibria , and the hungarian method . in : proceedings of the 27th international symposium on theoretical aspects of computer science . 287 - 298 . iwama , k. , miyazaki , s. , 2008 . a survey of the stable marriage problem and its variants . in : proceedings of the international conference on informatics education and research for knowledge - circulating society 2008 . 131 - 136 .","The text is a research paper that discusses the concept of a ""two-sided matching model"" in the context of college admissions and job matching. The authors introduce the concept of a ""two-sided matching model"" and its application to the college admissions problem, where students and colleges have preferences and reciprocating factors that influence the matching process.

The paper begins by discussing the original Gale-Shapley model, which is a classic model of matching in the context of college admissions. The authors then introduce the concept","in considering the college admissions problem , almost fifty years ago , gale and shapley came up with a simple abstraction based on preferences of students and colleges . 
 they introduced the concept of stability and optimality ; and proposed the _ deferred acceptance _ ( da ) algorithm that is proven to lead to a stable and optimal solution . 
 this algorithm is simple and computationally efficient . 
 furthermore , in subsequent studies it is shown that the da algorithm is also strategy - proof , which means , when the algorithm is played out as a mechanism for matching two sides ( e.g. colleges and students ) , the parties ( colleges or students ) have no incentives to act other than according to their true preferences . yet , in practical college admission systems , the da algorithm is often not adopted . instead , an algorithm known as the _ boston mechanism _ ( bm ) or its variants are widely adopted . in bm 
 , colleges accept students without deferral ( considering other colleges decisions ) , which is exactly the opposite of gale - shapley s da algorithm . to explain and rationalize this reality , 
 we introduce the notion of _ reciprocating preference _ to capture the influence of a student s interest on a college s decision . 
 this model is inspired by the actual mechanism used to match students to universities in hong kong . 
 the notion of reciprocating preference defines a class of matching algorithms , allowing different degrees of reciprocating preferences by the students and colleges . 
 da and bm are but two extreme cases ( with zero and a hundred percent reciprocation ) of this set . 
 this model extends the notion of stability and optimality as well . as in gale - shapley s original paper 
 , we discuss how the analogy can be carried over to the stable marriage problem , thus demonstrating the model s general applicability . * * jel classification**@xmath0c78

"[ sec : intro ] a _ reflection framework _ is a planar structure made of _ fixed - length bars _ connected by _ universal joints _ with full rotational freedom . additionally , the bars and joints are symmetric with respect to a reflection through a fixed axis . the allowed motions preserve the _ length _ and _ connectivity _ of the bars and _ symmetry _ with respect to some reflection . this model is very similar to that of _ cone frameworks _ that we introduced in @xcite ; the difference is that the symmetry group @xmath0 acts on the plane by reflection instead of rotation through angle @xmath1 . when all the allowed motions are euclidean isometries , a reflection framework is _ rigid _ and otherwise it is _ flexible_. in this paper , we give a _ combinatorial _ characterization of minimally rigid , generic reflection frameworks . formally a reflection framework is given by a triple @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is a finite graph , @xmath4 is a @xmath0-action on @xmath3 that is free on the vertices and edges , and @xmath5 is a vector of non - negative _ edge lengths _ assigned to the edges of @xmath3 . a _ realization _ @xmath6 is an assignment of points @xmath7 and a representation of @xmath0 by a reflection @xmath8 such that : @xmath9 the set of all realizations is defined to be the _ realization space _ @xmath10 and its quotient by the euclidean isometries @xmath11 to be the configuration space . a realization is _ rigid _ if it is isolated in the configuration space and otherwise _ flexible_.    as the combinatorial model for reflection frameworks it will be more convenient to use colored graphs . a _ colored graph _ @xmath12 is a finite , directed , the orientation of the edges do not play a role , but we give the standard definition for consistency . ] graph @xmath13 , with an assignment @xmath14 of an element of a group @xmath15 to each edge . in this paper @xmath15 is always @xmath0 . there is a standard dictionary ( * ? ? ? * section 9 ) associating @xmath16 with a colored graph @xmath12 : @xmath13 is the quotient of @xmath3 by @xmath15 , and the colors encode the covering map via a natural map @xmath17 . in this setting , the choice of base vertex does not matter , and indeed , we may define @xmath18 and obtain the same theory . we can now state the main result of this paper . [ theo : reflection - laman ] a generic reflection framework is minimally rigid if and only if its associated colored graph is reflection - laman .    the _ reflection - laman graphs _ appearing in the statement are defined in section [ sec : matroid ] . genericity has its standard meaning from algebraic geometry : the set of non - generic reflection frameworks is a measure - zero algebraic set , and a small _ geometric _ perturbation of a non - generic reflection framework yields a generic one . as in all known proofs of `` maxwell - laman - type '' theorems such as theorem [ theo : reflection - laman ] , we give a combinatorial characterization of a linearization of the problem known as _ infinitesimal rigidity_. to do this , we use a _ direction network _ method ( cf . @xcite ) . a _ reflection direction network _ @xmath19 is a symmetric graph , along with an assignment of a _ direction _ @xmath20 to each edge . the _ realization space _ of a direction network is the set of solutions @xmath21 to the system of equations : @xmath22 where the @xmath0-action @xmath23 on the plane is by reflection through the @xmath24-axis . a reflection direction network is determined by assigning a direction to each edge of the colored quotient graph @xmath12 of @xmath16 ( cf . * lemma 17.2 ) ) . since all the direction networks in this paper are reflection direction networks , we will refer to them simply as `` direction networks '' to keep the terminology manageable . a realization of a direction network is _ faithful _ if none of the edges of its graph have coincident endpoints and _ collapsed _ if all the endpoints are coincident . a basic fact in the theory of finite planar frameworks @xcite is that , if a direction network has faithful realizations , the dimension of the realization space is equal to that of the space of infinitesimal motions of a generic framework with the same underlying graph . in @xcite , we adapted this idea to the symmetric case when all the symmetries act by rotations and translations . as discussed in ( * ? ? ? * section 1.8 ) , this so - called `` parallel redrawing trick '' described above does _ not _ apply verbatim to reflection frameworks . thus , we rely on the somewhat technical ( cf . * theorem b ) , ( * ? ? ? * theorem 2 ) ) theorem [ theo : direction - network ] , which we state after giving an important definition . let @xmath19 be a direction network and define @xmath25 to be the direction network with @xmath26 . these two direction networks form a _ special pair _ if :    * @xmath19 has a faithful realization . * @xmath27 has only collapsed realizations . [ theo : direction - network ] let @xmath12 be a colored graph with @xmath28 vertices , @xmath29 edges , and lift @xmath16 . then there are directions @xmath30 such that the direction networks @xmath19 and @xmath27 are a special pair if and only if @xmath12 is reflection - laman .    briefly , we will use theorem [ theo : direction - network ] as follows : the faithful realization of @xmath19 gives a symmetric immersion of the graph @xmath3 that can be interpreted as a framework , and the fact that @xmath27 has only collapsed realizations will imply that the only symmetric infinitesimal motions of this framework correspond to translation parallel to the reflection axis .      in this paper , all graphs @xmath31 may be multi - graphs . typically , the number of vertices , edges , and connected components are denoted by @xmath28 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 , respectively . the notation for a colored graph is @xmath12 , and a symmetric graph with a free @xmath0-action is denoted by @xmath16 . if @xmath16 is the lift of @xmath12 , we denote the fiber over a vertex @xmath34 by @xmath35 , with @xmath36 , and the fiber over a directed edge @xmath37 with color @xmath38 by @xmath39 .    we also use _ @xmath40-sparse graphs _ @xcite and their generalizations . for a graph @xmath13 , a _ @xmath40-basis _ is a maximal @xmath40-sparse subgraph ; a _ @xmath40-circuit _ is an edge - wise minimal subgraph that is not @xmath40-sparse ; and a _ @xmath40-component _ is a maximal subgraph that has a spanning @xmath40-graph . points in @xmath41 are denoted by @xmath42 , indexed sets of points by @xmath43 , and direction vectors by @xmath30 and @xmath44 . realizations of a reflection direction network @xmath19 are written as @xmath21 , as are realizations of abstract reflection frameworks . context will always make clear the type of realization under consideration . lt is supported by the european research council under the european union s seventh framework programme ( fp7/2007 - 2013 ) / erc grant agreement no 247029-sdmodels . jm is supported by nsf cdi - i grant dmr 0835586 . [ sec : matroid ] in this short section we introduce the combinatorial families of sparse colored graphs we use . let @xmath12 be a @xmath0-colored graph . since all the colored graphs in this paper have @xmath0 colors , from now on we make this assumption and write simply `` colored graph '' . we recall two key definitions from @xcite .    the map @xmath18 is defined on cycles by adding up the colors on the edges . ( the directions of the edges do nt matter for @xmath0 colors . similarly , neither does the traversal order . ) as the notation suggests , @xmath45 extends to a homomorphism from @xmath46 to @xmath0 , and it is well - defined even if @xmath13 is not connected . let @xmath12 be a colored graph with @xmath28 vertices and @xmath32 edges . we define @xmath12 to be a _ reflection - laman graph _ if : the number of edges @xmath47 , and for all subgraphs @xmath48 , spanning @xmath49 vertices , @xmath50 edges , @xmath51 connected components with non - trivial @xmath45-image and @xmath52 connected components with trivial @xmath45-image @xmath53 this definition is equivalent to that of _ cone - laman graphs _ in ( * ? ? ? * section 15.4 ) . the underlying graph @xmath13 of a reflection - laman graph is a @xmath54-graph . another family we need is that of _ ross graphs _ ( see @xcite for an explanation of the terminology ) . these are colored graphs with @xmath28 vertices , @xmath55 edges , satisfying the sparsity counts @xmath56 using the same notations as in ( [ eq : cone - laman ] ) . in particular , ross graphs @xmath12 have as their underlying graph , a @xmath57-graph @xmath13 , and are thus connected @xcite . a _ _ ross - circuit__. ] is a colored graph that becomes a ross graph after removing _ any _ edge . the underlying graph @xmath13 of a ross - circuit @xmath12 is a @xmath57-circuit , and these are also known to be connected @xcite , so , in particular , a ross - circuit has @xmath58 , and thus satisfies ( [ eq : cone - laman ] ) on the whole graph . since ( [ eq : cone - laman ] ) is always at least ( [ eq : ross ] ) , we see that every ross - circuit is reflection - laman .    because reflection - laman graphs are @xmath54-graphs and subgraphs that are @xmath57-sparse are , in addition , ross - sparse , we get the following structural result .    [ prop : ross - circuit - decomp ] let @xmath12 be a reflection - laman graph . then each @xmath57-component of @xmath13 contains at most one ross - circuit , and in particular , the ross - circuits in @xmath12 are vertex disjoint .      [ sec : reflection-22 ] the next family of graphs we work with is new . a colored graph @xmath12 is defined to be a _ graph , if it has @xmath28 vertices , @xmath47 edges , and satisfies the sparsity counts @xmath59 using the same notations as in ( [ eq : cone - laman ] ) . the relationship between ross graphs and reflection-@xmath57 graphs we will need is :    [ prop : ross - adding ] let @xmath12 be a ross - graph . then for either    * an edge @xmath37 with any color where @xmath60 * or a self - loop @xmath61 at any vertex @xmath62 colored by @xmath63    the graph @xmath64 or @xmath65 is reflection-@xmath57 .    adding @xmath37 with any color to a ross @xmath12 creates either a ross - circuit , for which @xmath58 or a laman - circuit with trivial @xmath45-image . both of these types of graph meet this count , and so the whole of @xmath64 does as well . it is easy to see that every reflection - laman graph is a reflection-@xmath57 graph . the converse is not true . [ prop : reflection - laman - vs - reflection-22 ] a colored graph @xmath12 is a reflection - laman graph if and only if it is a reflection-@xmath57 graph and no subgraph with trivial @xmath45-image is a @xmath57-block.@xmath66    let @xmath12 be a reflection - laman graph , and let @xmath67 be the ross - circuits in @xmath12 . define the _ reduced graph _ @xmath68 of @xmath12 to be the colored graph obtained by contracting each @xmath69 , which is not already a single vertex with a self - loop ( this is necessarily colored @xmath63 ) , into a new vertex @xmath70 , removing any self - loops created in the process , and then adding a new self - loop with color @xmath63 to each of the @xmath70 . by proposition [ prop : ross - circuit - decomp ] the reduced graph is well - defined . [ prop : reduced - graph ] let @xmath12 be a reflection - laman graph . then its reduced graph is a reflection-@xmath57 graph . let @xmath12 be a reflection - laman graph with @xmath71 ross - circuits with vertex sets @xmath72 . by proposition [ prop : ross - circuit - decomp ] , the @xmath73 are all disjoint . now select a ross - basis @xmath74 of @xmath12 . the graph @xmath48 is also a @xmath57-basis of @xmath13 , with @xmath75 edges , and each of the @xmath73 spans a @xmath57-block in @xmath48 . the @xmath40-sparse graph structure theorem ( * ? ? ? * theorem 5 ) implies that contracting each of the @xmath73 into a new vertex @xmath70 and discarding any self - loops created , yields a @xmath57-sparse graph @xmath76 on @xmath77 vertices and @xmath78 edges . it is then easy to check that adding a self - loop colored @xmath63 at each of the @xmath70 produces a colored graph satisfying the reflection-@xmath57 counts ( [ eq : ref22a ] ) with exactly @xmath79 edges . since this is the reduced graph , we are done . a _ map - graph _ is a graph with exactly one cycle per connected component . a _ reflection-@xmath80 _ graph is defined to be a colored graph @xmath12 where @xmath13 , taken as an undirected graph , is a map - graph and the @xmath45-image of each connected component is non - trivial . [ lemma : reflection-22-decomp ] let @xmath12 be a colored graph . then @xmath12 is a reflection-@xmath57 graph if and only if it is the union of a spanning tree and a reflection-@xmath80 graph .    by ( * ? ? ? * lemma 15.1 ) , reflection-@xmath80 graphs are equivalent to graphs satisfying @xmath81 for every subgraph @xmath48 . thus , ( [ eq : ref22a ] ) is @xmath82 the second term in ( [ eq : ref22redux ] ) is well - known to be the rank function of the graphic matroid , and the lemma follows from the edmonds - rota construction @xcite and the matroid union theorem .    in the next section , it will be convenient to use this slight refinement of lemma [ lemma : reflection-22-decomp ] . [ prop : reflection-22-nice - decomp ] let @xmath12 be a reflection-@xmath57 graph . then there is a coloring @xmath83 of the edges of @xmath13 such that :    * the @xmath45-image of every subgraph in @xmath84 is the same as in @xmath12 . * there is a decomposition of @xmath84 as in lemma [ lemma : reflection-22-decomp ] in which the spanning tree has all edges colored by the identity . it is shown in ( * ? ? ? * lemma 2.2 ) that @xmath45 is determined by its image on a homology basis of @xmath13 . thus , we may start with an arbitrary decomposition of @xmath12 into a spanning tree @xmath85 and a reflection-@xmath80 graph @xmath86 , as provided by lemma [ lemma : reflection-22-decomp ] , and define @xmath83 by coloring the edges of @xmath85 with the identity and the edges of @xmath86 with the @xmath45-image of their fundamental cycle in @xmath85 in @xmath12 .    proposition [ prop : reflection-22-nice - decomp ] has the following re - interpretation in terms of the symmetric lift @xmath16 :    [ prop : reflection - laman - decomp - lift ] let @xmath12 be a reflection-@xmath57 graph . then for a decomposition , as provided by proposition [ prop : reflection-22-nice - decomp ] , into a spanning tree @xmath85 and a reflection-@xmath80 graph @xmath86 :    * every edge @xmath87 lifts to the two edges @xmath88 and @xmath89 . ( in other words , the vertex representatives in the lift all lie in a single connected component of the lift of @xmath85 . ) * each connected component of @xmath86 lifts to a connected graph . [ sec : direction - network ] we recall , from the introduction , that for reflection direction networks , @xmath0 acts on the plane by reflection through the @xmath24-axis , and in the rest of this section @xmath90 refers to this action .      the system of equations ( [ eq : dn - realization1])([eq : dn - realization2 ] ) defining the realization space of a reflection direction network @xmath19 is linear , and as such has a well - defined dimension . let @xmath12 be the colored quotient graph of @xmath16 .    to be realizable at all , the directions on the edges in the fiber over @xmath91 need to be reflections of each other . thus , we see that the realization system is canonically identified with the solutions to the system : @xmath92 from now on , we will implicitly switch between the two formalisms when it is convenient . let @xmath12 be a colored graph with @xmath32 edges . a statement about direction networks @xmath19 is _ generic _ if it holds on the complement of a proper algebraic subset of the possible direction assignments , which is canonically identified with @xmath93 . some facts about generic statements that we use frequently are :    * almost all direction assignments are generic . * if a set of directions is generic , then so are all sufficiently small perturbations of it . * if two properties are generic , then their intersection is as well . * the maximum rank of ( [ eq : colored - system ] ) is a generic property . we first characterize the colored graphs for which generic direction networks have strongly faithful realizations . a realization is _ strongly faithful _ if no two vertices lie on top of each other . this is a stronger condition than simply being faithful which only requires that edges not be collapsed . [ prop : ross - realizations ] a generic direction network @xmath19 has a unique , up to translation and scaling , strongly faithful realization if and only if its associated colored graph is a ross graph . to prove proposition [ prop : ross - realizations ] we expand upon the method from ( * ? ? ? * section 20.2 ) , and use the following proposition . [ prop : reflection-22-collapse ] let @xmath12 be a reflection-@xmath57 graph . then a generic direction network on the symmetric lift @xmath16 of @xmath12 has only collapsed realizations . since the proof of proposition [ prop : reflection-22-collapse ] requires a detailed construction , we first show how it implies proposition [ prop : ross - realizations ] . let @xmath12 be a ross graph , and assign directions @xmath30 to the edges of @xmath13 such that , for any extension @xmath64 of @xmath12 to a reflection-@xmath57 graph as in proposition [ prop : ross - adding ] , @xmath30 can be extended to a set of directions that is generic in the sense of proposition [ prop : reflection-22-collapse ] . this is possible because there are a finite number of such extensions .    for this choice of @xmath30 , the realization space of the direction network @xmath19 is @xmath94-dimensional . since solutions to ( [ eq : colored - system ] ) may be scaled or translated in the vertical direction , all solutions to @xmath19 are related by scaling and translation . it then follows that a pair of vertices in the fibers over @xmath62 and @xmath95 are either distinct from each other in all non - zero solutions to ( [ eq : colored - system ] ) or always coincide . in the latter case , adding the edge @xmath37 with any direction does not change the dimension of the solution space , no matter what direction we assign to it . it then follows that the solution spaces of generic direction networks on @xmath19 and @xmath96 have the same dimension , which is a contradiction by proposition [ prop : reflection-22-collapse ] . @xmath66      it is sufficient to construct a specific set of directions with this property . the rest of the proof gives such a construction and verifies that all the solutions are collapsed . let @xmath12 be a reflection-@xmath57 graph . [ [ combinatorial - decomposition ] ] combinatorial decomposition + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    we apply proposition [ prop : reflection-22-nice - decomp ] to decompose @xmath12 into a spanning tree @xmath85 with all colors the identity and a reflection-@xmath80 graph @xmath86 . for now , we further assume that @xmath86 is connected .

"as the main goal of the _ algebrodynamical _ approach @xcite , we regard the derivation of equations of physical fields ( or of fundamental physical laws , in a broader sense ) from a unique primary _ principle of purely abstract nature _ , based only on the intrinsic properties of exclusive mathematical structures ( groups , algebras , mappings etc . ) . basic realization of this concept developed in @xcite makes use of only the _ differentiability conditions _ of functions of _ biquaternionic variable _ , i.e. of the cauchy - riemann ( cr ) equations generalized to the case of noncommutative ( associative ) algebras .    in the framework of the version of analysis proposed in @xcite the noncommutativity of starting algebra naturally results in the nonlinearity of generalized cr equations ( gcre ) , justifying the use of the latters as the dynamical equations of _ interacting _ fields . infact , for the algebra of biquaternions @xmath0 ( isomorphic to the full @xmath1 complex matrix algebra ) the gcre appear to be lorentz invariant and carry natural 2-spinor and gauge structures . in the most examined case for which a simple geometric and physical interpretation is obvious , the conditions of _ @xmath0-differentiability _ reduce to the invariant system @xcite @xmath2 for @xmath3-valued 2-spinor @xmath4 and gauge @xmath5 fields represented by @xmath6 and @xmath1 @xmath3-matrices respectively . @xmath7 in ( 1 ) denotes usual matrix multiplication ( equivalent to that in @xmath0 ) , and @xmath8 represents a @xmath1 hermitian matrix of the increments of coordinates .    as a consequence of ( 1 ) each component of the 2-spinor @xmath9 satisfy the 4-eikonal equation @xcite . on the other hand , the _ compatibility conditions _ @xmath10 impose dynamical restrictions on the gauge field @xmath5 . namely , the @xmath11 matrix @xmath3-valued _ connection 1-form _ @xmath12 ( @xmath13 being the pauli matrices ) by virtue of compatibility conditions * should be self - dual*. consequently , * free maxwell and yang - mills equations are satistied * identically on the solutions of ( 1 ) , for the scalar @xmath14 and the vector @xmath15 parts of the connection ( 2 ) respectively @xcite . thus , the gcre system ( 1 ) exhibit wonderful relations to several fundamental physical equations being for the latters in some sense generating .    in the approach regarded , an important role is performed by _ singular sets _ where the strengths of maxwell and ym fields turn to infinity . such sets were found to have diverse dimensions and topology . solutions with _ compact _ structure of singular set may be then considered as _ particle - like _ , the evolution of such singularities - particles being then governed by the system ( 1 ) itself .    in this paper , we expound the process of reduction of system ( 1 ) to the equations of _ shear - free geodesic null congruences _ and , by kerr theorem , to the solution of _ algebraic _ equation @xcite . making use of this , we present an explicit form of the solutions to free maxwell equations , analyze the structure and evolution of their singular set and discuss the relation of these electromagnetic fields to the kerr - shild metrics and , by this , to the solutions of electrovacuum einstein - maxwell equations . in conclusion , we consider general status and physical interpretation of `` particle - like ''  singular solutions in the framework of electrogravidynamics and of unified algebraic field theory proposed . through the elimination of the gauge field @xmath5 the system of gcre ( 1 ) may be written in a 2-spinor form @xcite @xmath16 in the gauge @xmath17 the system ( 3 ) reduces to two equations for one unknown function @xmath18 @xmath19 @xmath20 being the _ spinor coordinates_. note that as a consequence of ( 4 ) @xmath18 satisfy identically both the 4-eikonal and dalembert wave equations @xcite . assuming the eqs . ( 4 ) are solved , the components of 4-potential matrix @xmath21 may be expressed through the function @xmath18 as @xmath22 and satisfy free maxwell equations .    wonderfully , eqs.(4 ) are completely identical to the equations of _ shear - free null geodesic congruences _ in the gauge for the spinor @xmath4 regarded @xcite . in accord with kerr s theorem @xcite , we then obtain the general solution of eqs.(4 ) in an implicit algebraic form @xmath23 @xmath24 being an arbitrary golomorphic function of three complex variables including two _ twistor _ ( projective ) components @xmath25 thus , a lot of solutions to free maxwell equations may be obtained through simply examining of the algebraic eq.(6 ) . singularities of related field strengths may be then found from the _ caustic _ condition @xmath26 eliminating the only unknown function @xmath18 from two algebraic eqs.(6),(8 ) , one easily comes to the _ equation of singular set _ which determines the shape and evolution of singularities , without even taking care of explicit solving the eq.(6 ) itself . the example of such procedure was presented in @xcite . from the structure of twistor components ( 7 ) it s evident that stationary solutions to eq.(6 ) are exhausted by the functions @xmath27 , where @xmath28 does nt contain the time variable @xmath29 at all . in accord with the results of kerr and wilson @xcite , for stationary solutions with * compact * structure of singular set the function @xmath30 * should be at most quadratic in @xmath31 * , i.e. should have the form @xmath32 . linear dependence on @xmath31 immediately leads to the trivial solution with zero fields . using 3-translations and 3-rotations , the above form may be reduced to @xmath33 for which we obtain from quadratic eq.(6 ) @xmath34 for a real valued @xmath35 from ( 9 ) and the expression for potentials ( 5 ) we obtain the coulomb electric field with a point singularity and a * fixed value of the electric charge * as a consequence of nonlinear primary system of gcre ( 1 ) . imaginary values of @xmath35 correspond to the _ ring singularity _ with radius @xmath36 and multipole structure of em fields with coulomb first main term @xcite . decomposition and separation of real parts of em fields at a distance @xmath37 gives @xmath38 @xmath39 contrary to an ambiguous value of ring s radius @xmath35 , the dimensionless electric charge is strictly fixed ( up to a sign ) by field equations , so that in absolute units it may be identified with _ elementary charge _ note that the solution ( 9 ) ( for the case @xmath41 ) and the property of charge quantization for the gcre system ( 1 ) have been obtained in a direct way in @xcite . ( recently @xcite there were some interesting attempts to explain electric charge quantization by topological reasons instead of dynamical considerations used here ) .    on the other hand , solution ( 9 ) is extremely important in the framework of gtr . indeed , the expression @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the 2-spinor related to the function @xmath18 , defines the _ principal null congruences _   @xmath44 of a riemannian space - time endowed with a kerr - shild metric @xmath45 where @xmath46 represents the metric of auxiliary minkowski space - time . the scalar factor @xmath47 should be then determined by the einstein vacuum or electrovacuum equations and for fundamental stationary solution ( 9 ) leads to the kerr or kerr - newman metrics respectively ( consequently , to the schwarzschild or reissner - nordstrm metrics for the case @xmath35=0 ) . in our approach , it is of great importance that * singularities of curvature of metric ( 10 ) are fixed @xcite by the same condition ( 8) as for electromagnetic field * and define infact one unique particle - like object . another wonderful fact is that for the kerr - newman solution of einstein - maxwell equations electromagnetic fields are just those defined by the gcre system ( apart from the property of quantization of charge for the latters ! ) and may be asymptotically presented by the eq.(10 ) . moreover , these fields * obey maxwell equations both in flat space and in riemannian space with kerr - shild metric ( 11 ) ! * such a remarkable _ property of stability _ of electromagnetic fields under kerr - shild deformations of space - time geometry noticed in @xcite will be discussed elsewhere . making use of correspondence between the fundamental solution ( 9 ) to the gcre system ( 1 ) and the kerr - newman solution of einstein - maxwell system , one is able to endow the solution ( 9 ) with a complete set of quantum numbers ( including mass and spin ) . then the _ gyromagnetic ratio _ would automatically correspond to that for dirac particle , while the charge would be fixed in magnitude . unfortunately , no natural reasons to ensure the quantization of mass could be seen nowadays . we ll continue the discussion below . let us consider the general quadratic form of the function @xmath24 . when the terms bilinear in @xmath48 , @xmath49 are absent , such functions ( under the restriction on singular set to be compact ) correspond to the boosted or rotated kerr solution @xcite . on the other hand , the function @xmath50 has been considered in detail in @xcite . the explicit expression for @xmath31 in this case is @xmath51 where @xmath52 . em fields correspondent to ( 12 ) are @xmath53 for real @xmath54 the fields ( 13 ) are identical to the well - known _ born solution _ for two point - like charged `` particles '' performing uniformly accelerated counter - motion . the value of electric charge for each particle does not depend on @xmath54 being * fixed and equal to the charge of fundamental solution ( 9)*. for the case of imaginary @xmath54 one has the singularity of rather exotic toroidal structure , defined by the equation @xmath55 ( see @xcite for details ) . in general case of complex - valued @xmath54 singular set manifests itself as the two rings of fixed radii performing again the oncoming hyperbolic motion along @xmath56-axis . it may be proved that ( up to the transformations of poincare group ) the _ axisymmetric _ solutions to the eq.(6 ) ( and to the gcre system ( 1 ) respectively ! ) generated by quadratic function @xmath30 * are exhausted by the kerr - like solution ( 9 ) and the nonstationary bisingular solution ( 12 ) * together with ( toroidal or double ring - like ) modifications of the latter . it seems , however , that the solutions to gcre with compact singularity and non - axial symmetries may be of interest too . here we present an example of such solution which may be obtained from the generating function @xmath57 . resolving the equation @xmath58 , one comes to the following expression @xmath59 @xmath60 where @xmath61 . the singular set for this solution is defined by the condition @xmath62 and for @xmath63 has the form of flat _ figure `` 8 ''   curve _ ( fig.a )  ) . the time evolution of this singularity is illustrated by fig.b ) . a )  t=0  b )  t=1   [ pic1 ]    em fields related to the solution ( 14 ) and being represented by the complex combination @xmath64 are :    @xmath65    for each finite moment of time they decrease rapidly ( as @xmath66 ) with the distance from the centre of singularity . the fields are neutral ( with total charge being equal to zero ) and null ( @xmath67 ) .    in conclusion , we present a peculiar solution with noncompact singularity which serves as the _ analogue of electromagnetic wave _ in grce dynamics . for the solutions of wave - like type the generating function @xmath30 should depend only on one twistor component , say , @xmath48 . then , for the equation @xmath68 the initial distribution of @xmath69 may be arbitrary fixed at @xmath70 , i.e. at the @xmath71-axis . choosing for the latter the _ monochromatic _ dependence and resolving the equation @xmath72 , where the parameters @xmath73 are assumed to be real and positive , we find    @xmath74 @xmath75 being the principal branch of the so called _ lambert _   function which is the solution of the equation @xmath76 . the structure of singular set is simply derived after that and appears to be a neutral _ helix _ of radius @xmath77 and of lead @xmath78 propagating along @xmath71- direction with the speed of light . electromagnetic fields are mutually orphogonal and transversal while polarization depends on the distance from the axis . in the direction perpendicular to the axis the fields fall at large distancies as @xmath79 . as before , the fields are globally defined only up to a sign . shear - free null geodesic congruences @xmath44 and the kerr - shild metrics ( 12 ) may be associated with the nonstationary solutions above - presented up to the scalar factor @xmath47 . at present it s not clear if the latter may be choosed so that the einstein - maxwell electrovacuum system would be satisfied . by this , an interesting representation @xcite for the shear - free congruences ( through consideration of null cone emanated by the source moving along some curve in _ complex space _ ) as well as the _ condition of stability _ for electromagnetic fields under the kerr - schild deformations of space - time geometry @xcite may be of great use . well - known are the numerous problems arising in gtr and in quantum field theory in respect to the singularities of solutions of field equations ( violation of causality @xcite , divergences etc . ) . on the other hand , just the naked singularity of kerr - newman solution ( which appears instead of black hole solution in the case of a large angular moment ) manifests itself many remarkable properties related to that of elementary particles . accordingly , several attempts to construct the model of electron on the base of kerr - type solutions ( kts ) have been undertaken @xcite . however , they all dealt with the problem of physically suitable _ source _ for kts to be found which is tigthly related to the well - known _ twovaluedness _ of kerr - like geometry and electromagnetic fields in particular . infact , the introduction of source becomes admissible only after the _ cut _ of space which restore the global uniqueness of the @xmath3-valued functions representing the fields of kts . unfortunately , the surface of cut is quite ambigious : it may be either the _ disk _ spanning the kerr singular ring @xcite or the oblate spheroid @xcite covering the singular ring on which the kerr - newman metric turns surprisingly into the minkowski one . consequently , one may think of the source of kts as of the `` rotating relativistic disk '' , of the `` bubble of flat geometry '' within the external kerr - newman space - time etc . thus , we are to conclude that * there are no grounds to speak about the `` source ''   of kts solutions at all * since the twovaluedness is the unavoidable feature of their internal mathematical structure .    to illustrate the above statement , let us consider a simplier case of the singular `` particle - like ''   solutions to free maxwell equations in flat space - time presented in this paper . note that all of them ( apart from the coulomb and born solutions with point - like singularities ) are of the same two - valued structure being in each point defined up to a sign . certainly , by no @xmath80- function distribution of charge and current along the singular curve one can reproduce the field distribution in the whole space . on the other hand , such solutions are locally well defined and may be analytically continuated from the region of regularity so that the full structure of singular set is established * in a unique way*. one can not in any way change either the shape and topology of the singularity or its time evolution ( the latter property being the most important from physical point of view ) . suppose we really hope to describe the interactions and transmutations of elementary particles by means of the solutions regarded ( which are rather to be _ multisingular _ for real physical process ) . then we ll proceed in well - defined and unique predictions in spite of partial indefinitness of em fields and escape any divergences at all ! moreover , one may think of such solutions as of * the only possibility to explain the `` spin 1/2 ''   structure * at a purely classical level and with transparent picture of space - time dynamics being preserved . this is still more true in the framework of the algebrodynamical approach we develop , at least for two reasons . the first one is that in respect to the internal structure of gcre system ( 1 ) , gauge ( electromagnetic plus yang - mills ) fields stand there hand by hand with the 2-spinor structure so that the latter appears naturally together with maxwell equations . the second reason is that , apart from the right value of gyromagnetic ratio , the value of electric charge is automatically fixed by the field equations themselves .    of course , the stationary kts as well as bisingular and `` figure 8 ''   solutions presented here can say nothing about real dynamics of an ansamble of compact `` particle - like ''   singularities . even the problem of interaction of two kerr - newman objects is far from solution . in the framework of algebrodynamics the overdetermined structure of gcre impose restrictions even on the initial distribution of the fields @xcite so that the scattering problem should be fully reformulated . historically , the solution of maxwell equations with ring singularity have been obtained by appel in 1887 and revived in the works of newman and burinskii @xcite . general study of singular solution to maxwell equations have been undertaken by bateman @xcite . nowadays the concept of naked singularities of kts as the model for elementary particles is successfully developed , say , in the works of clement @xcite .    to conclude , we argue that hostile attitude of physicists to singularities of field equations could be quite unjustified . there exist no restrictions of principal character for the _ compact multisingular _ solutions to describe the interactions of particle - like objects in a self - consistent way . then their transmutations could be treated as _ perestroikas _ of singularities in terms of catastrophe theory . this programme should be implemented independently both in the framework of einstein - maxwell dynamics and of the algebraic dynamics based in particular on the gcre system ( 1 ) .","The text discusses the algebraic approach to the study of singularities in physical fields, specifically in the context of general relativity and quantum field theory.

"the notion of spin currents describing the motion of magnetic moments associated with the spins of the electrons in solids is of central importance in the field of spintronics where one tries to use the spin degree of freedom to store and process information . unfortunately , in systems lacking spin - rotational invariance ( which can be broken by an external magnetic field or by relativistic effects such as spin - orbit coupling or dipole - dipole interactions ) the proper definition of the quantum mechanical operator representing the spin current is ambiguous , because the magnetization does not satisfy a local conservation law . in the past decade several authors have proposed resolutions of this ambiguity @xcite , but a generally accepted agreement on the correct definition of the spin current operator in systems without spin conservation has not been found .    the purpose of this work is show that the distinction between translational and angular spin currents proposed by sun and xie @xcite leads to a simple and unique definition of the concept of spin transport in condensed matter systems . sun and xie @xcite pointed out that spin currents describe moving magnetic dipoles , and that generally the transport of any vector can be decomposed into a translational part characterized by some velocity @xmath0 and an angular part described by some angular velocity @xmath1 , see fig . [ fig : transport ] . in the context of spin transport sun and xie @xcite called the latter contribution the _ angular spin current _ , although this can be also viewed as the spin torque discussed earlier by culcer _ et al . _ [ ] .     with a velocity @xmath2 , corresponding to the physical movement of a magnetic moment with magnitude @xmath3 . ( b ) precessional motion of the magnetic polarization @xmath4 with a frequency @xmath5 . the latter motion is purely angular and leaves the magnitude @xmath3 of the magnetic moment invariant . , scaledwidth=40.0% ]    we will explicitly show below that the equation of motion of a magnetic moment @xmath6 at lattice site @xmath7 with magnitude @xmath8 and polarization @xmath9 can be decomposed into a translational part @xmath10 that corresponds to the physical movement of magnetic dipole moments , and an angular part @xmath11 that describes the precessional motion of the magnetization . we will provide expressions for the translational spin current operator @xmath12 and the precession frequency @xmath13 valid for itinerant as well as localized systems . although the explicit construction of this decomposition is very simple , it entails profound physical consequences : since only the translational movement of magnetization corresponds to the physical displacement of magnetic moments , in equilibrium only stationary translational spin currents can generate an electrical field @xcite . angular spin currents on the other hand only transport the polarization , hence a stationary angular spin current is simply an inhomogeneous configuration of the local magnetic order and does not create an electrical field . furthermore , we also show that in generic magnetic insulators the classical magnetic order can not support translational spin transport at vanishing temperature ; incoherent thermal or quantum fluctuations are mandatory for the physical transport of magnetization in these systems . this also implies that spin superfluidity in magnetic insulators @xcite must be angular spin transport that can be visualized as transporting the spin polarization , but does not correspond to the physical movement of magnetic moments . the remainder of this work is organized as follows : in sec . [ sec : separation ] we will derive general expressions for the operators corresponding to the translational spin current and to the precession frequency of the magnetization , first for itinerant systems and then for localized magnetic moments . we proceed to illustrate the usefulness of the decoupling procedure in sec .  [ sec : supercurrents ] , where we discuss spin superfluidity in easy - plane ferromagnets and persistent spin currents in heisenberg rings . finally , in sec . [ sec : conclusions ] we present our conclusions . the appendix contains some additional details of the self - consistent spin - wave expansion we employ to describe easy - plane ferromagnets . in this section , we explicitly show how translational and angular spin transport can be defined on the operator level .      to construct the proper quantum mechanical definition of the translational spin transport operator let us consider a lattice model describing electrons with spin - dependent hopping @xmath14 in an inhomogeneous magnetic field @xmath15 . the second quantized hamiltonian of our model is @xmath16 where @xmath17 is some spin - rotationally invariant interaction , @xmath18 annihilates a fermion with spin - projection @xmath19 at lattice site @xmath20 , and the itinerant spin operators are defined by @xmath21 here @xmath22 is the vector of pauli matrices . the spin - dependent hopping energies @xmath14 are of the form @xmath23 where the vectors @xmath24 are proportional to the strength of the spin - orbit coupling . the hermiticity of the hamiltonian implies the symmetries @xmath25 and @xmath26 . using the canonical anticommutation relations @xmath27 and the fact that the interaction is spin - rotationally invariant , @xmath28 = 0 $ ] , we obtain the heisenberg equation of motion for the itinerant spins , @xmath29 where we have defined the operator @xmath30 it is tempting to associate this operator with the spin current describing the transport of spin from lattice site @xmath20 to lattice site @xmath31 . it turns out , however , that a certain part of this operator simply renormalizes the external magnetic field and therefore can not be associated with translational spin transport . to isolate this contribution and identify the angular part which renormalizes the precessional motion of the spins , we take the quantum mechanical expectation value of both sides of the equation of motion ( [ eq : eomit ] ) and obtain a formally exact equation of motion for the magnetic moments @xmath32 , @xmath33 where the spin torque is defined by @xmath34 to identify the contribution responsible for translational spin transport , we further decompose the vector @xmath35 into a longitudinal and a transverse part , @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the local spin polarization and @xmath38 writing @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the induced magnetic field perpendicular to the direction of @xmath41 , we see that the transverse part @xmath42 renormalizes the external magnetic field . the total angular frequency relevant for the precessional motion of the magnetic moments is @xmath43 the term @xmath44 can be called angular spin current @xcite or spin torque @xcite and should be added to the external torque @xmath45 acting on the magnetic moments . the expectation value of the equation of motion ( [ eq : eomd ] ) can now be written as @xmath46 from this expression it is easy to show that the spin torque does not contribute to the time - evolution of the magnitude @xmath47 of the magnetic moments , which satisfies the equation of motion@xcite @xmath48 in contrast , the precessional motion of the spin polarization is governed solely by the spin torque , @xmath49 in summary , the renormalized precession frequency associated with the angular spin current is @xmath50 while the operator representing the translational spin current is @xmath51 note that time - dependent changes in the length of the magnetization are always accompanied by translational spin transport . on the other hand , stationary translational spin currents are also possible if the length of the magnetization is constant @xcite . the above expressions have been derived for a lattice model for itinerant electrons . it is instructive to work out the explicit form of the rotation vector @xmath52 and the translational spin current operator @xmath53 for a localized spin model containing only the spin degrees of freedom . for simplicity , let us specify the interaction to the on - site hubbard interaction @xmath54 , where @xmath55 . assuming @xmath56 and a half - filled lattice , we can use a canonical transformation @xcite to derive from eq . ( [ eq : hubbard ] ) an effective hamiltonian involving only spin @xmath57 operators @xmath58 acting on the reduced hilbert space of singly occupied lattice sites . the effective spin hamiltonian can be written as@xcite @xmath59 where the spin - spin interaction tensor has three contributions , @xmath60 here the isotropic exchange coupling @xmath61 and the antisymmetric dzyaloshinskii - moriya vector @xmath62 are given by @xmath63   = \frac{8}{u } \textrm{re } \left [ t_{ij } \bm{\lambda}_{ij}^ * \right ] ,   \end{aligned}\ ] ] while @xmath64 is a symmetric tensor in spin space with matrix elements @xmath65 .\ ] ] the heisenberg equation of motion can be written as @xmath66 where the operator @xmath67 is the strong coupling limit of the operator @xmath68 defined in eq . ( [ eq : islattice ] ) in the reduced spin hilbert space . here @xmath69 is a tensor in spin space with matrix elements given by eq . ( [ eq : jtens ] ) . alternatively , eq .  ( [ eq : istrong ] ) can be obtained directly from eq . ( [ eq : islattice ] ) via a canonical transformation @xcite . with the substitution @xmath70 the expressions ( [ eq : omegageneral ] ) and ( [ eq : igeneral ] ) for the local precession frequency and the longitudinal spin transport operator remain valid , so that we obtain @xmath71 in the classical limit and at vanishing temperature the quantum mechanical expectation value @xmath72 can be factorized , @xmath73 consequently the expectation value of the longitudinal spin current operator vanishes identically in this limit . this implies that for a generic magnetic insulator with a spin hamiltonian of the form of eq . ( [ eq : hspin ] ) incoherent thermal or quantum fluctuations are a necessary prerequisite for the transport of actual magnetization . the local precession frequency reduces in the same limit to @xmath74 . \label{eq : omegaires }   \end{aligned}\ ] ] the last term in eq . ( [ eq : omegaires ] ) is proportional to @xmath75 and hence does not contribute to @xmath76 so that we may write @xmath77 , where the renormalization of the magnetic field is given by @xmath78 note that eq . ( [ eq : hex2 ] ) can also be obtained by means of a simple mean - field decoupling of the spin hamiltonian in eq . ( [ eq : hspin ] ) . to illustrate the differences between translational and angular spin transport and how this affects the interpretation of spin supercurrents , it is instructive to consider simple model systems that can support translational and angular spin currents in equilibrium or in metastable states .      let us first consider an easy - plane ferromagnet described by the spin @xmath79 heisenberg hamiltonian @xmath80 on a simple cubic lattice , with exchange coupling @xmath81 for nearest neighbors only , and an easy - plane anisotropy @xmath82 . this kind of systems has served in the literature as elementary example for spin superfluidity @xcite . we will now calculate the local precession frequency ( [ eq : omegaspin ] ) and the translational spin current ( [ eq : ispinparallel ] ) for this system to leading order in an @xmath83 expansion . to facilitate this we expand the spin operators in a local basis defined by the instantaneous direction of the spin polarization @xmath84 : @xmath85 here , @xmath86 and @xmath87 are unit vectors chosen such that @xmath88 form a right - handed basis at every lattice site . in this basis we may now bosonize the spin operators by means of a holstein - primakoff ( hp ) transformation ,    [ eq : hp ] @xmath89    where the @xmath90 are canonical bose operators . especially note that since we self - consistently define the quantization axis as the direction of the local magnetization , @xmath84 , by definition the hp bosons can never condense @xcite . this is completely analogous to the fact that in the superfluid phase of interacting bosons the bogoliubov quasi - particles , which are the goldstone modes associated with the spontaneous breaking of the u(1)-symmetry in the superfluid state , do not condense provided the condensate wave - function is self - consistently defined via the solution of the gross - pitaevskii equation .    with the hp bosonization ( [ eq : hp ] ) , we find that the leading order contributions to the precession frequency and the spin current are of order @xmath79 . explicitly , the local precession frequency ( [ eq : omegaspin ] ) becomes @xmath91 to this order , the polarization equation of motion ( [ eq : polarization ] ) recasts the landau - lifshitz equation of classical spin dynamics . assuming that the magnetic texture @xmath92 varies only slowly in space , we can take the continuum limit . the exchange contribution to the polarization equation of motion can then be identified with the divergence of the classical spin current , @xmath93 where the classical spin current is defined as @xmath94 here @xmath95 , and @xmath96 is the distance between nearest neighbors . an exact equilibrium solution for the polarization is then given by @xmath97 $ ] , with a local phase satisfying @xmath98 . the @xmath99 freedom associated with the choice of @xmath100 lies at the heart of the concept of spin superfluidity @xcite . out of equilibrium we can make the general ansatz @xmath101 \nonumber\\[.2 cm ] & + \bm{e}_z \rho(\bm{r},t ) , \end{aligned}\ ] ] which is depicted graphically in fig . [ fig : easy_plane ] .     denotes the deviation from the ground state with the magnetization lying in the @xmath102-@xmath103-plane . superfluid angular transport is possible due to the @xmath99 freedom of the phase @xmath104 in this plane . , scaledwidth=40.0% ]    if the system is only slightly driven out of equilibrium , the equation of motion ( [ eq : polarization ] ) for the spin polarization becomes to lowest nonvanishing order in deviations from equilibrium    [ eq : josephson ] @xmath105    the above eqs . ( [ eq : josephson ] ) are of the form of the josephson equations of superconductivity ; hence they are conventionally interpreted as describing a spin supercurrent carried by the magnetization texture @xcite . however , since this current does not correspond to translational transport of the local magnetization @xmath106 , this supercurrent is _ not _ equivalent to the superfluid transport of magnetic moments . in particular , a stationary angular supercurrent with @xmath107 is simply an inhomogeneous magnetic texture ; while it can be viewed as a stationary transport of polarization , it does not correspond to any physical movement of magnetic moments which would generate an electrical field @xcite . to evaluate the @xmath108 contribution to the translational spin current ( [ eq : ispinparallel ] ) , we will assume for simplicity a slowly varying magnetic texture @xmath75 in a metastable superfluid state with @xmath109 . applying the hp transformation ( [ eq : hp ] ) to the spin current ( [ eq : ispinparallel ] ) then yields @xmath110 , \ ] ] which can to be evaluated to @xmath111 , \ ] ] where @xmath7 and @xmath112 are nearest neighbor lattice sites . here @xmath113 is the distribution functions of magnons with dispersion @xmath114 and velocity @xmath115 , and the remaining coefficient of the quantum - mechanical zero - point fluctuations is @xmath116 a detailed derivation of the hamiltonian in the local basis and of the magnon dispersion ( [ eq : ek ] ) is relegated to the appendix . in equilibrium the translational current ( [ eq : iplane ] ) of course vanishes by symmetry , i.e. , @xmath117 . therefore there is no translational movement of magnetic moment in this superfluid spin state . lastly , let us note that the complete decoupling of the magnetic texture and the incoherent magnons is an artifact of the lowest order approximation in the @xmath83 expansion , and of the assumption of a slowly varying texture . if one relaxes either of these approximations , there will be a coupling , resulting in a two - fluid description of spin transport like the one discussed in [ ] . we emphasize however that from the point of view we adopted , the superfluid does not arise due to the condensation of magnons . we rather consider the magnons as fluctuations on top of the superfluid ground state ; these magnons can not condense by definition . next , let us consider a system where the translational spin current is finite even in equilibrium , i.e. , there is a persistent translational spin current corresponding to the phyiscal movement of magnetic moments . consider a ferromagnetic spin @xmath79 heisenberg model in a radial inhomogeneous magnetic field with quantum mechanical hamiltonian @xmath118 where the sums are over the @xmath119 sites of the lattice of localized spins on the ring coupled by ferromagnetic exchange interactions @xmath120 if @xmath121 and @xmath122 label nearest neighbors . @xmath15 is a crown - shaped inhomogeneous magnetic field of the form @xmath123,\ ] ] where the angles @xmath124 label the positions of the spins on the ring , as illustrated in fig . [ fig : crown ] .     between the magnetization and the @xmath125-axis is slightly smaller then the angle @xmath126 between the external field and the @xmath125-axis , see ref . [ ] . , scaledwidth=40.0% ]    in ref . [ ] it has been shown that at finite temperature @xmath127 spin - wave excitations carry a persistent equilibrium spin current @xmath128 circulating the ring . here @xmath129 is the length of the ring , @xmath130 is the magnon velocity , and the magnon dispersion is @xmath131 , with lattice spacing @xmath96 and quantized wavevectors @xmath132 . @xmath133 is the solid angle traced out by the local magnetization direction @xmath75 on the unit sphere in order parameter space as it moves around the chain . this finite solid angle @xmath133 , i.e. , the topology of the spin configuration on the ring , is responsible for the finiteness of the equilibrium current ( [ eq : iring ] ) . the situation is completely analogous to persistent electrical currents in mesoscopic metal rings pierced by a magnetic flux @xcite . these electrical currents generate a magnetic dipole field ; one of us has shown in ref .  [ ] that the persistent spin current ( [ eq : iring ] ) similarly generates an electric dipole field . this can be understood as follows @xcite : a magnetic dipole moment @xmath134 moving with velocity @xmath2 generates a magnetic field @xmath135 in its rest frame . lorentz - transforming back to the laboratory frame , we find that to lowest order in @xmath136 ( where @xmath137 is the speed of light ) this magnetic field generates an electrical field @xmath138 . at zero temperature the equilibrium current ( [ eq : iring ] ) vanishes because there are no spin waves in the ferromagnetic ground state . however , bruno and dugaev @xcite pointed out that in this system the classical spin current @xmath139 defined in eq . ( [ eq : jclassical ] ) is finite and argued that therefore the system exhibits an equilibrium spin supercurrent even at @xmath140 . while this interpretation is possible , we stress that this classical current is angular and not translational ; hence it can not be associated with the motion of magnetic dipoles , but should rather be considered as a renormalization of the external magnetic field @xcite . to understand this , let us explicitly calculate the inhomogeneous magnetization configuration in the classical ground state of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltoniancrown ] ) . just as in the easy - plane ferromagnet , the equation of motion for the magnetic texture @xmath75 is to leading order in @xmath83 the classical landau lifshitz equation @xmath141 where the exchange field is @xmath142 . the equilibrium solution of the landau - lifshitz equation ( [ eq : llring ] ) is @xmath143 where the angle @xmath144 is slightly smaller than the angle @xmath126 between the magnetic field and the @xmath125-axis , as discussed in ref . the deviation of @xmath144 from @xmath126 is determined by the exchange field @xmath145 . as for the easy - plane ferromagnet discussed in the last section , the continuum limit of the exchange torque is the divergence of the classical spin current , @xmath146 . for the classical ground state ( [ eq : groundstatering ] ) , the classical spin current has a finite component @xmath147 . however , as in the easy - plane ferromagnet , this finite current merely signals an inhomogeneous magnetization configuration and is not related to the physical transport of magnetization ; hence it also will not generate any electrical field . if one would on the other hand incorrectly associate the classical spin current @xmath148 with the stationary movement of physical dipoles , it would have to be accompanied by an electrical field . this would imply that a purely static inhomogeneous magnetization configuration is always accompanied by an electric field , in contradiction with the elementary fact that in classical electromagnetism magnetostatics and electrostatics are completely decoupled . finally , let us also point out that although the classical ground state ( [ eq : groundstatering ] ) of the heisenberg ring is very similar to the classical ground state of the easy - plane ferromagnet discussed in the last section , it does not support spin superfluidity , i.e. , angular spin supercurrents , because the phase @xmath124 of the magnetization is pinned by the external magnetic field @xmath149 , eq . ( [ eq : hcrown ] ) . we conclude that in the classical limit the angular spin current introduced by sun and xie @xcite can be absorbed into a renormalization of the external magnetic field which contributes to the torque acting on the magnetic moments . in equilibrium , this term does not describe any current of magnetic moments because the equilibrium configuration of the magnetization is such that the total torque on each moment vanishes . translational transport of spins is described by the longitudinal spin current defined in eq . ( [ eq : ispinparallel ] ) , which is only finite due to thermal or quantum fluctuations . an example for a system exhibiting a finite longitudinal spin current in equilibrium is a mesoscopic heisenberg ring in a crown - shaped magnetic field , as discussed in ref . our considerations imply that in equilibrium the classical spin current @xmath150 defined in eq . ( [ eq : jclassical ] ) does not describe any motion of magnetization . while it can be interpreted as a stationary current of magnetic polarization , such an interpretation is by no means mandatory since there is no phyiscal movement . in nonequilibrium on the other hand , the classical spin current @xmath150 contributes to the angular spin current , i.e. , to the precessional motion of the spins , and does transport spin polarization . in particular , this implies that spin superfluidity , which is based on the formal similarity of eq . ( [ eq : josephson ] ) with a mass supercurrent of superfluid bosons @xcite , does not correspond to the physical movement of _ magnetization _ , but of _ polarization_. this means that in equilibrium , a superfluid spin state will not be accompanied by an electrical field , in contrast to a persistent translational spin current @xcite . this physical difference between the two types of spin transport persists also out of equilibrium : as already shown by sun and xie @xcite , an angular spin current with finite @xmath151 will generate an electrical field @xmath152 for large distance @xmath153 from the source , whereas the electrical field of translational spin currents decays as @xmath154 . we have also shown that spin superfluidity can be described entirely without referring to off - diagonal long - range order @xcite and magnon condensation . this is achieved by quantizing the spins in a self - consistently defined frame of reference with the local @xmath125-axis pointing in the direction @xmath155 of the instantaneous magnetization . magnons defined with respect to this reference frame can never condense or display off - diagonal long - range order , hence they are not superfluid . this is in agreement with the general proof of kohn and sherrington @xcite that bosonic quasi - particles which are formed as bound states of particle - hole pairs of the underlying fermionic system ( such as excitons or magnons ) do not exhibit off - diagonal long - range order in coordinate space . hence , the bose - einstein condensation of this type of bosons is not accompanied by superfluidity . although the change in magnetic order in a magnetic insulator can be viewed as bose - einstein condensation of magnons @xcite , the resulting state can always be characterized by magnons that exhibit neither off - diagonal long - range order nor superfluidity . this work was financially supported by the dfg via sfb / trr49 . our ideas on spin transport were sharpened during a workshop on _ quantum spintronics : spin transport through quantum magnetic materials _ at the spin phenomena interdisciplinary center ( spice ) at the university of mainz , germany . this appendix is devoted to the derivation of the dispersion ( [ eq : ek ] ) of the magnons in the local reference frame defined by the magnetic polarization @xmath84 . we have already derived the general setup of a spin - wave expansion in this local and possibly time dependent reference frame in ref . the first step is to rotate the @xmath125-axis of the laboratory frame to the direction @xmath156 of the local magnetization by means of an unitary transformation @xmath157 acting on the spins . the explicit form of @xmath157 is given in ref . it then turns out that the rotated hamiltonian @xmath158 contains an additional berry - phase term acting as a magnetic field due to the time dependence of @xmath156 , @xmath159 writing the spin polarization as @xmath160 + \bm{e}_z \cos\theta_i , \ ] ] we can choose the transverse basis vectors as @xmath161 + \bm{e}_z \sin\theta_i . \ ] ] expanding the berry - phase magnetic field in this basis , @xmath162 , we explicitly find      applying the holstein - primakoff transformation ( [ eq : hp ] ) to the rotated hamiltonian then yields @xmath164 here the classical ground state energy is @xmath165 the term linear in the bose operators can be written as @xmath166 where @xmath13 is the @xmath108 local precession frequency , eq . ( [ eq : omegas ] ) . because the magnetic polarization satisfies the equation of motion @xmath167 up to this order in @xmath83 , we conclude that @xmath168 vanishes identically . note that this implies that the holstein - primakoff bosons can not condense , a statement which remains true to all orders in @xmath83 due to the self - consistency of the basis . up to this point the discussion is completely general and applies to all magnetic insulators .    to evaluate the quadratic part of the rotated hamiltonian we will assume as in the main text that the magnetic texture varies only slowly in space and is only slightly out of equilibrium . then we may approximate @xmath169 , @xmath170 , @xmath171 , with @xmath172 , and @xmath173 . with this simplifications we immediately obtain @xmath174 , \end{aligned}\ ] ] which describes free magnons with the dispersion ( [ eq : ek ] ) . 99 e. i. rashba , https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/physrevb.68.241315[_spin currents in thermodynamic equilibrium : the challenge of discerning transport currents _ ] , phys . b * 68 * , 241315(r ) ( 2003 ) . e. i. rashba , https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/physrevb.70.161201[_spin currents , spin populations , and dielectric function of noncentrosymmetric semiconductors _ ] , phys . b * 70 * , 161201 ( 2004 ) . e. i. rashba , http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10948-005-3349-8[_spin dynamics and spin transport _ ] , j. supercond . * 18 * , 137 ( 2005 ) . f. schtz , m. kollar , and p. kopietz , https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/physrevlett.91.017205[_persistent spin currents in mesoscopic heisenberg rings _ ] , phys . lett . * 91 * , 017205 ( 2003 ) . f. schtz , p. kopietz , and m. kollar , http://link.springer.com/article/10.1140%2fepjb%2fe2004-00348-9[_what are spin currents in heisenberg magnets ? _ ] , eur . j. b * 41 * , 557 ( 2004 ) . d. culcer , j. sinova , n. a. sinistyn , t. jungwirth , a. h. macdonald , and q. niu , https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/physrevlett.93.046602[_semiclassical spin transport in spin -

Spin currents are defined as the transport of spin degrees of freedom in solids, which can be described by the spin current operator. The text highlights the importance of spin currents in understanding the behavior of magnetic materials, particularly in the context of spin superfluidity.

The text begins by discussing the notion of spin currents and their relation to spin transport in solids. It explains that spin currents can be described by the","in magnets with non - collinear spin configuration the expectation value of the conventionally defined spin current operator contains a contribution which renormalizes an external magnetic field and hence affects only the precessional motion of the spin polarization . 
 this term , which has been named angular spin current by sun and xie [ phys . 
 rev b * 72 * , 245305 ( 2005 ) ] , does not describe the translational motion of magnetic moments . 
 we give a prescription how to separate these two types of spin transport and show that the translational movement of the spin is always polarized along the direction of the local magnetization . 
 we also show that at vanishing temperature the classical magnetic order parameter in magnetic insulators can not carry a translational spin current , and elucidate how this affects the interpretation of spin supercurrents .

"many neural network models@xcite@xcite ,  in addition to their potential applications to computation , robotics and artificial intelligence , constitute intriguing dynamical systems in their own right , showing unusual manifestations of the statistical mechanics phenomena of order , disorder and frustration . the connection between neural networks and statistical mechanics became especially clear with the introduction of the hopfield @xcite@xcite model ,  which furnishes a model of associative memory , or the recall of a memorized pattern from an incomplete stimulus . this model has a well - defined energy function and is closely related to the sherrington - kirkpatrick spin glass model @xcite@xcite .    in this paper we consider a hopfield - like network of @xmath0 bistable elements , the bistable gradient network or bgn , previously introduced in @xcite . a closely related model was also discussed in @xcite and suggested as a model for the so - called `` bistability of perception '' in the interpretation of ambiguous visual stimuli @xcite . the network s dynamics consists of a continuous gradient descent described by the coupled differential equations @xmath1 where @xmath2 are continuous - valued real state variables associated with the @xmath3 nodes of the network and the hamiltonian or energy function is given by @xmath4 the quantities @xmath5 are a symmetric matrix of coupling strengths , and the quantities @xmath6 are bias terms or external inputs to the network . for the remainder of this paper we will set all @xmath7 unless otherwise stated ;  we include them here only for the sake of generality . @xmath8 is a control parameter determining the strength of the internode couplings relative to the local terms . the variables @xmath9 can be viewed as components of an @xmath3-dimensional state vector @xmath10 . we define a normalized inner product between two state vectors @xmath11 and @xmath12 by @xmath13 . the first term in the hamiltonian represents a local double - well potential for each node , making each node individually bistable . this local potential constitutes the main difference between the bgn and the hopfield model . the classical hopfield network ( hn ) which we consider by way of comparison is described by the hamiltonian @xmath14 where the @xmath9 are now _ discrete _ state variables restricted to the values @xmath15 . although continuous versions of  the hn have also been studied ,  these generally lack the bistability property , and their behaviour is essentially similar to that of the discrete version @xcite . the variables @xmath9 can be thought of as the outputs of proccessing units or neurons . their dynamical equations can be written as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the input to the neuron from internal and external connections . by analogy with ising spin systems , we also refer to @xmath18 as a magnetic field . the steady - state output for a given input is a solution of the fixed - point equation @xmath19 when @xmath20 , there are stable fixed points at @xmath21 and an unstable fixed point at @xmath22  an applied field shifts the positions of the fixed points . a saddle - node bifurcation occurs when @xmath23 so that for larger values of the field there is only one equilibrium , aligned with the field ( @xmath24 and @xmath25 have the same sign ) . @xmath24 is in principle unbounded ;  the output does not truly saturate when the input is large . the double - valuedness and the lack of saturation are the principal differences between the input - output relation for the bgn and that of the hopfield model , including its continuous  versions . numerous experimental studies have been made on intriguing chemical analogs of the bgn ( see , e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) . these studies involved networks of bistable chemical reactors coupled either electrically or through mass exchange . previous computational work on small bgn s @xcite  suggested that under some conditions the network might permit the storage of a larger number of patterns than in a hn of the same size , without any modification of the basic hebb learning rule . it was noted , however , that the stability of a particular attractor can depend on the control parameter @xmath8 . some dependence of pattern stability on the coupling strength had also been noted in the experiments on the mass - coupled chemical networks @xcite .     in this paper we focus on the behaviour of the network in the case where the number of nodes is large and the number of memorized patterns is small .  using both analytical techniques and numerical simulations fell below a convergence criterion which for most examples was taken as 0.001 . our hn simulations , which were used for comparisons , were performed using asynchronous updating in random order . unless otherwise indicated , all simulations were done on an @xmath26 network with @xmath27 stored memory patterns . ] , we examine the retrieval of stored patterns and classify the attractors that occur . we find that there are three types of attractors . in addition to _ memory _ or _ retrieval states _ , there are spurious attractors in which no pattern is fully recognized . these include the _ mixture _ or _ spin glass _ _ states _ familiar from hn studies , as well as an additional category specific to the bgn which we refer to as _ uncondensed states_.  we examine how the attractors and their basins of attraction change as the control parameter @xmath8 is changed .  throughout the paper , we compare our model to the zero - temperature or deterministic discrete hopfield model . it is hoped that these results can illuminate some of the novel behavior of the bgn and clarify its relation to the hn . the behavior of the bgn under higher memory loading and the question of its maximum storage capacity will be addressed elsewhere . as in previous work on hopfield networks@xcite@xcite@xcite , we define the task of associative memory as follows . we are given a set of  @xmath28 distinct @xmath3-dimensional vectors or _ memory patterns _  @xmath29 @xmath30 which are to be recognized by the network . the patterns should correspond to attractors of the network s dynamics . we will refer to these attractors as _ retrieval states . _  input is given by imposing a particular initial condition on the network .  if that initial condition is sufficiently close to one of the memorized patterns , then the network s state should converge to the correct nearby attractor , and we say that the network has recognized or retrieved the pattern . in this paper we follow the hn literature in considering the case where the patterns are random and uncorrelated strings of @xmath31 s and @xmath32 s . we read the output of the network according to the _ signs _ of the @xmath9 . thus we say that the network has recalled pattern 1 , for example , if @xmath33 for all @xmath34 . although variations in the magnitude of @xmath9 can be important to the dynamics ,  we will for the moment ignore them for the purpose of reading the output .  as we will see below , the retrieval states in general do not have @xmath35 even though the patterns have @xmath36  we focus here on the limiting case @xmath37 , @xmath38 ,  or large networks with low memory loading . ( strictly speaking , we take @xmath3 to infinity while @xmath28 remains finite . )  in this case the inner product of a pair of patterns * *  * * @xmath39 behaves as a gaussian random variable with zero mean and variance @xmath40 ,  so that in the @xmath37 limit the pattern vectors are nearly orthogonal to each other  and form a basis for a @xmath28-dimensional subspace of the @xmath3-dimensional configuration space .    as in the hn , we construct the coupling matrix from the stored patterns according to the hebb @xcitelearning rule : @xmath41 the term @xmath42 is included to make all diagonal elements of the coupling matrix zero . non - zero diagonal entries would have the effect of adding an additional quadratic self - interaction term . following the usual practice we omit them here so that the quadratic term is contained only in the local potential .  for the case @xmath43 , however , the effect of the diagonal elements is negligible and we can substitute the simpler learning rule @xmath44    a useful set of order parameters are the overlaps @xmath45 , which are inner products of the network s state with each of the stored patterns : @xmath46 for the discrete hn , these variables take values @xmath47 ,  while for the bgn any real values are possible .  it will be useful to define another set of variables , which we will call `` bit overlaps , '' by should not be confused with the biases or external fields @xmath6 in ( [ hamiltonian ] ) , which are set to zero for the remainder of this paper .  ] @xmath48  the bit overlap is simply related to the hamming distance by  @xmath49 where the hamming distance @xmath50 between two vectors is defined as the number of elements for which their signs differ , or the number of positions @xmath34 such that @xmath51 . unlike @xmath52 the bit overlaps always obey @xmath53 . they encode information about sign agreements but not about magnitudes of the outputs @xmath9 . the definitions of the overlap variables allow us to rewrite the hamiltonian and the dynamical equations in useful forms . @xcite  in particular , if the synaptic matrix @xmath54 is given by the simplified hebb rule ( [ simplehebb ] ) , then the interaction term of the hamiltonian can be rewritten in terms of @xmath45 as follows : @xmath55 and the net input to a given node from the other nodes is given by @xmath56      to show that the network functions properly as an associative memory , we exhibit the attractor states corresponding to the stored patterns , demonstrate their stability , and show that a pattern can be retrieved from an initial condition which lies close to the pattern but differs from it by one or more incorrect signs . consider the state @xmath57 where @xmath58 is a scalar and @xmath59 is a particular one of the stored patterns . we will show that for a suitable value of @xmath58 this state represents a stable fixed point of the dynamics and is therefore the retrieval state we seek . in this state , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and all other overlaps are small . the field acting on the @xmath34-th node can be written as follows:@xmath62 the sum over patterns @xmath63 is called the crosstalk term . for the overlaps with these other patterns we have@xmath64 since the patterns are random , each of these overlaps is of order @xmath65 . the number of patterns remains finite as @xmath37 , so the sum in the crosstalk term vanishes in this limit and @xmath66 .  a stationary state must satisfy the fixed point condition ( [ fixedpt ] ) for each node , which leads to a self - consistency condition on @xmath58 : @xmath67 in the last step , we have used the fact that @xmath68 when @xmath69 and then divided out the common factor of @xmath70 . solutions to this condition are an unstable equilibrium @xmath71 and two stable equilibria@xmath72 the two stable solutions represent perfect retrieval of pattern @xmath73 and its mirror state , respectively . the doubled state is a consequence of the @xmath74 symmetry in the hamiltonian .  since the overlap @xmath75 is equal to @xmath58 and all other overlaps vanish in the thermodynamic limit , the energy of this retrieval state is easily calculated using expression ( [ mham ] ) for the energy in terms of the overlap variables , giving:@xmath76 note that this energy expression is extensive ( proportional to @xmath3 ) and a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath8 . having identified the state @xmath77 as an equilibrium state , we now demonstrate its stability using a linear stability analysis of the dynamical equations@xmath78 evaluating the jacobian @xmath79 at the fixed point ( [ retrievalstate ] ) we obtain :   @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the kronecker delta . the fixed point is linearly stable if and only if the jacobian has no positive eigenvalues . this depends in turn on the eigenvalues of the synaptic connection matrix @xmath54 . but in the limit where all of the stored patterns @xmath29 are mutually orthogonal , the stored patterns are themselves eigenvectors spanning a degenerate subspace with eigenvalue 1 , while the complement of this subspace has eigenvalue 0 . ( the hebb rule ( [ simplehebb ] ) itself gives a spectral decomposition of @xmath54 . ) since the maximum eigenvalue of @xmath54 is 1 ,  we see that the jacobian at the retrieval fixed point has no positive eigenvalues and so the retrieval state is linearly stable for any value of @xmath8 . in fact , all eigenvalues become more negative as @xmath8 increases . @xmath82 we reiterate that this result is valid in the ideal limit of large @xmath3 and low loading where the stored patterns are orthogonal .  for finite - sized networks with finite overlaps among the patterns ,  it is possible for the memory states to be destabilized by the crosstalk terms . this issue will be examined elsewhere . numerical results for a network with @xmath26 nodes and @xmath27 random patterns agree excellently with the above description .  to study a retrieval state numerically , we initialized the network to the state @xmath83 ( arbitrarily choosing the first pattern ) .  starting at @xmath84 ,  we increased @xmath8 by small steps to @xmath85 . at each step , we integrated the dynamical equations until they converged . this procedure allows us to examine the evolution of a state under quasistatic changes in the control parameter @xmath86  we verified that @xmath87 remained equal to 1 over the whole range @xmath88 indicating that the retrieval state is stable . the measured values of @xmath89 and @xmath90 were within 1% of the theoretical expressions ( [ retrievalm ] ) and ( [ retrievale ] ) respectively . linear stability analysis has shown that the retrieval states are stable against _ infinitesimal _ perturbations for any value of @xmath8 , but this does not guarantee their stability against the flipping of signs of one or more nodes .  in order to function as an associative memory , a network must be capable of dynamically correcting sign errors .  when presented with an input at a small , nonzero hamming distance from one of the stored patterns ( i.e. , differing from it by a few reversed signs ) it must be able to flip the reversed signs and restore the correct pattern . we will now show that there is a critical value @xmath91 above which the correction of sign - flip errors can occur .  for smaller values of @xmath8 the bgn does not correct sign errors and thus does not truly function as an associative memory , but as @xmath8 increases above @xmath92 the retrieval states develop increasingly large basins of attraction .     consider a state of the network which is a slightly corrupted retrieval state :  all node variables have the values @xmath93 with the exception of one or possibly some number @xmath94 of nodes which may be misaligned . in such a state the few misaligned nodes make only a small contribution to the overlap sums , so we have @xmath95 and @xmath96 . the field acting on each node is therefore @xmath97 the misaligned bits experience a field opposite to their signs . if the field becomes larger than the critical value @xmath98 then there is only one stable equilibrium for each node , and the misaligned nodes will flip to conform with the stored pattern . error correction therefore occurs if @xmath99 the critical value occurs when the equality @xmath100 holds , or at @xmath91 . if the pattern is more strongly corrupted ( a significant number of bits misaligned ) then the situation is more complicated , because the presence of a larger number of misaligned bits may reduce the value of @xmath75 and thus the magnitude of the field . the misaligned bits have a significant back - reaction on the ones with the correct sign . the correction of larger numbers of sign errors requires higher values of @xmath8 . we will return to this point later ; the basic result is that when @xmath8 is only slightly above the threshold of @xmath101 the memory states have rather small basins of attraction , but these basins grow as @xmath8 increases . in the case of the hn , the hebb learning rule results in a large number of `` spurious '' attractors in addition to the retrieval states .  the energy function defines a rugged landscape , and a trajectory which does not start sufficiently close to one of the stored patterns may become trapped in one of the spurious local minima instead of one corresponding to a recalled pattern . it is possible to suppress the spurious minima by introducing thermal noise which allows trajectories to jump out of the shallower basins of attraction into deeper ones .     at low levels of loading , the hn possesses spurious attractors which are nonlinear combinations of the stored patterns . there is a hierarchy of symmetric _ mixture states _ of the form@xcite@xcite@xmath102 these states overlap equally with @xmath103 different patterns :  @xmath104 .  for the hn , only the mixtures with odd @xmath103 are stable . the @xmath105 mixtures have the lowest energy in this category , and the energies increase with @xmath106 asymptotically approaching @xmath107 . as the number of stored patterns @xmath28 increases , these spurious states proliferate exponentially ; their number is of order @xmath108 . there are also non - symmetric mixtures . the proliferation of spurious states is associated with spin glass type behaviour in the hn . accordingly we also refer to these mixed states somewhat loosely as _ spin glass states_.     we will show here that the bgn possesses mixture states analogous to those of the hn , but their structure is slightly more complex . let us focus on the @xmath105 symmetric mixture state with positive signs . for the hn , this state is given by @xmath109 this state is stable against individual sign flips because each node is subject to a non - zero magnetic field which maintains its alignment .  to see this , note that there are two possibilities for each bit either all three patterns agree at that particular site ( @xmath110 or one of the patterns has the opposite sign from the other two , for example @xmath111  when all three agree , we say that the @xmath34-th bit is a unamimous  bit . if the patterns are random , then each @xmath112 is @xmath15 with equal probability ,  giving a probability of @xmath113 that a given bit is unanimous . the mixture state has equal overlaps with all three of the patterns .  since for a given @xmath34 there is a probability of @xmath114 that @xmath115 , we have @xmath116 , and likewise @xmath117  the field acting at the @xmath34-th site is @xmath118 ( consistent with the low - loading , large-@xmath3 limit , we ignore all other overlaps which are of order @xmath40 . )  this gives @xmath119 for unanimous bits and @xmath120 for the others .  in any case , each node of the hn experiences a field which stabilizes its alignment . we will now show that the bgn , like the hn , possesses a mixture state in which the sign of @xmath9 is given by the majority vote of three of the stored patterns : @xmath121 this state has a more complicated structure , however , because the magnitude of @xmath9 at a given node depends significantly on the local field at that node . since the field at a unanimous bit is stronger than the field at a non - unanimous bit , we expect the magnitude of @xmath9 to be larger for a unanimous bit .  therefore , we make the _ _ ansatz__@xmath122{ll}% a\operatorname{sign}(\xi_{i}^{\mu_{1}}+\xi_{i}^{\mu_{2}}+\xi_{i}^{\mu_{3 } } ) & \text{if \ } \xi_{i}^{\mu_{1}}=\xi_{i}^{\mu_{2}}=\xi_{i}^{\mu_{3}}\\ d\operatorname{sign}(\xi_{i}^{\mu_{1}}+\xi_{i}^{\mu_{2}}+\xi_{i}^{\mu_{3 } } ) & \text{otherwise}% \end{array } \right . \label{bgnthreemix}%\ ] ] where @xmath123 and @xmath124 are real numbers .  the dynamical equations for the network give a pair of self - consistency equations which can be solved numerically for @xmath123 and @xmath125  first , we need an expression for the overlap of the mixture state with one of the three patterns , say , pattern @xmath126 . if the @xmath34-th bit is a unanimous bit , then @xmath127 has magnitude @xmath123 and agrees in sign with @xmath128 . on the other hand , if it is a non - unanimous bit , then @xmath127 has magnitude @xmath124 and has a @xmath129 probablity of agreeing in sign with @xmath128 . the result is that @xmath130 note that in the special case @xmath131 , the above expression reduces to the hopfield value @xmath132 , as it should . again , all three overlaps have the same size : @xmath133  .  the total energy of the network in this state is given by@xmath134 we can think of this as an an energy function on the restricted family of states parametrized by ( [ bgnthreemix ] ) . a necessary condition for the mixture state ( [ bgnthreemix ] ) to be a fixed point is that @xmath135 . this gives us two self - consistency conditions for the parameters @xmath123 and @xmath124 : @xmath136 these are the equations of  the nullclines of the energy function ( [ bgnthreee ] ) . alternatively , the above equations could be derived directly from the dynamical equations for each node and the expressions for @xmath18 instead of using the energy function .  for a _ stable _ fixed point , @xmath137 must be a local minimum of the energy function ( [ bgnthreee ] ) . the self - consistency equations ( [ selfconsist ] ) can be rewritten as follows:@xmath138 \nonumber\\ a   &   = \frac{4}{\gamma}\left [   d^{3}-(1+\frac{\gamma}{4})d\right ]   .\end{aligned}\ ] ] the graphs of these two cubic equations are plotted for @xmath139 in figure [ nullclinesboth]a . solutions are points where the two nullclines intersect . note that the slope , @xmath140 , of the first curve at the origin is @xmath141 and for the second curve @xmath142 . these two inequalities satisfied by the slopes ensure that the curves always intersect in at least 5 points . the five solutions can be classified by looking at the energy function and its gradient . we see that the solution @xmath143 is an unstable node ( maximum of the energy ) , the two solutions in the 2nd and 4th quadrants are saddle points , and the two solutions in the first and third quadrants are the stable solutions we seek . ( there are two because of the @xmath74 sign reversal symmetry  one is a mirror state of the other . ) [ ptb ]    fig1.eps       the self - consistency equations for @xmath123 and @xmath124 were solved numerically for a range of @xmath8 values using a gradient descent algorithm . these values were in turn substituted into ( [ bgnthreee ] ) to find the energy as a function of @xmath8 . the results are plotted in figure [ mixcompare ] where they are also compared with numerical results from dynamical simulations of a bgn with @xmath26 . we studied the mixture state numerically by initializing a network to the state @xmath144 and incrementing @xmath8 beginning at 0 , much as was done for the retrieval states . figure [ mixcompare]a shows the magnitudes of  unanimous and non - unanimous bits in the mixture state as functions of @xmath86 the solid lines show the solutions of the self consistency equations for @xmath123 and @xmath124 . the symbols show the observed magnitudes @xmath145 for @xmath146 in the simulated network state . two of these first six bits are unanimous while the other four are not . there is good agreement between the observed values of @xmath147and the values obtained from the self - consistency equations .  for comparison , @xmath148 is plotted as a dotted line on the same axes . ( recall that this is the value of all @xmath149 in a pure retrieval state . ) figure [ mixcompare]b shows a corresponding comparison of the observed and theoretical energies . finally , figure [ mixcompare]c  compares the @xmath105 mixture state with the retrieval state by plotting the ratios  @xmath150 and @xmath151 as well as the ratio of the mixture state energy @xmath152to that of a retrieval state @xmath153 . all three of these ratios appear to approach constant asymptotic values as @xmath8 increases . asymptotically ,  @xmath154 ,  while for the hn the corresponding ratio is 0.75 . the strength of the field acting on each unanimous bit , @xmath155 ,  and that acting on the non - unanimous bits , @xmath156 , both increase as @xmath8 increases . the mixture state is stable against single sign flips of the unanimous bits when @xmath157 and stable against any single sign flip when @xmath158 . thus as @xmath8 increases , the mixture state begins to develop a non - trivial basin of attraction of its own . [ ptb ]    fig2.eps       it is interesting to note that at @xmath159 a saddle - node bifurcation occurs and for @xmath160 two aditional stable solutions to the self - consistency equations ( [ selfconsist ] ) appear in the second and fourth quadrants , at @xmath161 and @xmath162 . ( see figure [ nullclinesboth]b . ) these are states with @xmath163  in which @xmath164  and the net field acting on each node exactly cancels . they are not stable against sign flips , and become completely destabilized when @xmath165 . as we will see in the following section , they do not properly belong to the category of mixture or spin glass states , but rather to another class of spurious attractors present only in the bgn at low values of @xmath8 . here we examined only the @xmath105 mixture state ,  but similar methods may be used to characterize higher - order mixtures . in general , they are more complex as there are more possibilities for the size of the majority by which the sign is determined . the magnitudes of @xmath9 then take a greater number of distinct values . in section [ errorcorrect ] , we noted that for values of @xmath8 not far above @xmath92 ,  it is possible that a state may have a significant overlap with one of the stored patterns but that the field acting on the nodes may nonetheless not be strong enough to overcome the potential barrier and correct the sign errors . indeed if @xmath8 is below @xmath101 then even a single sign error may go uncorrected . this consequence of the bistability of the bgn units contrasts with the behavior of the hn . consider first the case of the hn . a typical random initial state has small but nonzero overlaps with the memorized patterns ,  @xmath166 , resulting in fields @xmath167 which are random with zero mean and variance of order @xmath168 .  typically , for approximately half of the nodes @xmath9 and @xmath18 will initially have opposite signs . since there is no potential barrier against sign flips , those nodes will change their signs , and the sign flips will continue until the field experienced by every node is aligned with @xmath9 .  every sign flip will increase the magnitude of one or more of the overlap variables . if , for example ,  one overlap @xmath75 is larger than all of the others , then most nodes will experience fields which tend to align them with pattern @xmath73 . every sign flip further increases the value of @xmath75 , and eventually @xmath75 will be fully retrieved even though the initial overlap may have been quite small .  however , if one overlap does not clearly dominate the others , then the trajectory may arrive at a spurious attractor which has roughly equal overlaps with several patterns , instead of at a single one of the memory states . even a state which is initially orthogonal to all of the memorized patterns can be rendered unstable by changing a single sign :  even a single sign flip will create a small but nonzero field affecting the other nodes , resulting in further sign flips , and so on .  in summary , for the hn essentially any initial condition converges under the dynamics to an attractor lying in or close to the @xmath28-dimensional subspace of the patterns .    for the bgn , on the other hand , the situation is different due to the presence of potential barriers .  just as with the hn , given any state @xmath10 every node @xmath34 experiences a field @xmath18 , which may be aligned with or opposed to @xmath9 .  however , the antiparallel local fields may not be strong enough to flip their nodes into the parallel direction . if most @xmath18 are well below the threshold @xmath169 then the flipping of one or a few nodes will not change the field enough to cause any further flips . thus there might be a large number of initial conditions which remain stuck with low overlaps , far away from any of the patterns . we refer to such states with sub - threshold fields as uncondensed  states , because in those states none of the order paramenters @xmath45 are condensed .  however , we will show below that states with low overlaps can not remain stable for @xmath165 ,  and thus for higher values of @xmath8 the behavior is hopfield - like , with all trajectories collapsing toward the pattern subspace . consider a hypothetical state which is strictly orthogonal to all memory patterns , so that @xmath170 for all @xmath171 . ( the extra solutions appearing in the self - consistency equations for the mixture state when @xmath160 are examples of such states . ) if @xmath170 for all @xmath171 , then @xmath172 for all @xmath34 .  in this case , the steady state of each node is @xmath173 . proceeding with linear stability analysis as above , we find the relevant jacobian@xmath174 the equilibrium is unstable if @xmath175 , where @xmath176 is the largest eigenvalue of the coupling matrix . @xmath177 is at least 1 . therefore , if @xmath165 , states orthogonal to the stored patterns are all unstable .  if all of the @xmath28 stored patterns are mutually orthogonal ( which is approximately true in the limit @xmath37 )  then for @xmath165 there are @xmath28 unstable eigenvalues .     we can examine one of those unstable directions , say , the one associated with the @xmath73-th pattern , more closely by making an explicit _ ansatz . _  let us denote the orthogonal , zero - overlap state by @xmath178 ; by assumption @xmath179 for all @xmath171 including @xmath180 .  for half of the nodes @xmath181 ; for the other half @xmath182 . let us then consider a family of states described by the _ _ ansatz__@xmath183{ll}% a\xi_{i}^{\bot}=a\xi_{i}^{\nu } & \text{if } \xi_{i}^{\bot}=\xi_{i}^{\nu}\\ b\xi_{i}^{\bot}=-b\xi_{i}^{\nu } & \text{if } \xi_{i}^{\bot}=-\xi_{i}^{\nu}% \end{array } \right . \label{unstable}%\ ] ] this parametrizes a 2-dimensional subspace of the state space which contains @xmath184 and one of its unstable eigenvectors .  using the methods of section [ mixture ] , one obtains a pair of cubic self - consistency equations for @xmath123 and @xmath185:@xmath186  for all @xmath8 there are two solutions @xmath187 which correspond to the retrieval states @xmath188 .  for @xmath160 there are additional stable solutions @xmath189 corresponding to @xmath190 @xmath191 . a bifurcation occurs at @xmath159 and these solutions become saddle points . thus ,  we see that there is an absolute upper limit for the existence of stable uncondensed states . in fact , @xmath159 turns out to be a high upper bound . the example of a state with all @xmath45 equal to zero is a sort of worst - case scenario .  for a finite - sized network the typical random initial condition has small but nonzero overlaps . in addition , if the patterns are truly random then they will not be exactly orthogonal but have small overlaps and so the largest eigenvalue of the synaptic matrix will be slightly larger than unity .  because of these factors the typical uncondensed state becomes unstable at values of @xmath8 lower than 2 ; in  numerical simulations we found that for the case @xmath192 most become unstable between @xmath193 and @xmath194 . figures [ dyna05]-[dyn12b ] , we show numerical results for the fate of a typical random initial condition of the bgn with @xmath26 , @xmath27 .  figures [ dyna05]-[dyna12 ] show the dynamical evolution of the same initial condition , at different values of @xmath8 . the initial condition was a random string of @xmath15 values . we plot the energy per node , all five overlap variables @xmath45 and all five bit overlap variables @xmath195 as functions of time . recall that @xmath195 contain information about sign agreements only .  for @xmath196 ( figure [ dyna05 ] ) the state changes very little before convergence occurs . the energy per node remains very close to @xmath197 . the overlaps @xmath45 increase slightly in magnitude , but the bit overlaps do not change at all , indicating that no sign flips occur .  for @xmath193 ( figure [ dyna10 ] )  the trajectory is similar , except that the small initial overlaps are amplified to a greater extent ( we will explain this effect below . )  the bit overlaps still do not change .  when @xmath198 ,  however , the trajectory changes qualitatively ( figure [ dyna12 ] ) . the magnitudes of the overlaps @xmath45 grow slowly until at @xmath199 the resulting field becomes strong enough to begin flipping some signs . at this point the bit overlaps begin to change , the energy drops significantly and the trajectory moves close to the pattern subspace .  after some further evolution , the system converges to a mixture state which overlaps with several patterns . a different random initial condition , followed again at @xmath198 , leads instead to a memory state ( figure [ dyn12b ] ) . here one of the five overlaps becomes dominant and the others shrink away . in this case the mirror state of one of the five patterns is retrieved . these trajectories are typical examples representing descent on a rugged energy landscape . different initial conditions lead to different attractors , of which some are memory states and some are mixtures . frequently the trajectory lingers at one or several states before settling at its asymptotic attractor . [ ptb ]    fig3.eps    [ ptb ]    fig4.eps    [ ptbptb ]    fig5.eps    [ ptbptbptb ]    fig6.eps    figures [ dyna05]-[dyna10 ] illustrated that for sufficiently small values of @xmath8 ,  the dynamics amplifies small initial overlaps without flipping the sign of any node .  for more insight into this phenomenon , consider an initial state in which all @xmath9 are @xmath15 but somewhat more nodes are aligned parallel with one particular pattern @xmath200 than are antiparallel . in other words , @xmath201 is nonzero but less than unity .  for simplicity let us neglect all other overlaps . initially , each node experiences a small field given by @xmath202  this field will push @xmath9 to larger magnitudes @xmath203 for those nodes which are aligned with pattern @xmath200 ,  and it will push the others to smaller magnitudes @xmath204 .  this adjustment in turn increases the value of @xmath75 , until an equilibrium is reached with @xmath205 . we might think of this as a kind of  subliminal  recognition of the pattern .  the effect becomes stronger as @xmath8 increases . clearly it has a nonlinear dependence on both @xmath8 and @xmath201 . when the field becomes large enough it will exceed the threshold for sign flips and the state will be attracted toward the pattern retrieval state . the larger @xmath8 is , the smaller the initial @xmath201 that is necessary to fully retrieve the pattern @xmath200 .  in other words , the basins of attraction of the patterns expand as @xmath8 increases . in this section , we provide numerical support for the three - way classification of attractors into retrieval , spin glass and uncondensed states and we show how the respective attractor basins change with the control parameter @xmath206 . we observe an interpolation between two different regimes . as we showed above , for @xmath207 there are no stable uncondensed states .  for lower values of @xmath8 , on the other hand , uncondensed states are numerous . recall that uncondensed states are characterized by local fields too weak to overcome the potential barriers against sign flips ,  and so their dynamics is dominated by the local potential .  in the extreme case @xmath84 , there are of course no magnetic fields at all and only the local potential is present . the classification of attractors is very clearly reflected in the energy spectrum .  to explore attractors and their basins , we seeded  the network with 500 random initial conditions ( taken with several different realizations of the five random patterns ) , integrated the dynamical equations until they converged , and constructed a histogram of the final energies ( figure [ seedhist ] ) .  for the case @xmath193 ( figure [ seedhist]a ) , there are three clearly separated clusters of attractors .  those with the lowest energies are retrieval states ,  while the states clustered at @xmath208 are the uncondensed states , and those in the intermediate range are the glassy states . the picture is qualitatively similar at the slightly larger value @xmath209 ( figure [ seedhist]b ) ,  but the peak at @xmath208 has shrunk relative to the other two . note that the energies of the retrieval and spin glass states change with @xmath8 ,  while the uncondensed states remain at nearly the same energy because their dynamics is dominated by the local potential . for @xmath159 , ( figure [ seedhist]c )  on the other hand , the cluster at @xmath208 is absent as there are no stable uncondensed states . the histogram for a hn ( figure [ seedhist]d ) resembles that for the bgn with @xmath159 . one quantitative difference is that the retrieval state peak is slightly higher for the bgn with @xmath159 , while the glassy states are comparatively suppressed . we performed this experiment at a range of values of @xmath8 .  in all cases the classification of states was clear from the energy spectrum and was verified by examining the final values of @xmath195 . figure [ attractorprobs ] shows the probabilities of convergence to each of the three types of attractors from a random initial condition as functions of @xmath8 .  at @xmath196 the landscape is dominated by the uncondensed states . even though @xmath196 lies above the threshold of @xmath92 and the retrieval states have non - trivial basins of attraction , these basins still occupy a very small fraction of the total configuration space volume . the patterns can be retrieved only if the initial overlaps are relatively high , and the probability of a _ random _ initial condition being sufficiently close is very low . the retrieval probability becomes significant only as @xmath8 approaches 1 .  as @xmath8 increases from 1 to 1.5 , basins for the memory and spin glass states grow at the expense of of the uncondensed states until the latter disappear . the retrieval state basins grow faster than those of the spin glass states .  beyond @xmath210 , the probability of retrieving a memory state saturates at approximately a @xmath211 higher value than in the hopfield case , and the probability of falling into a spin glass state is correspondingly lower . [ ptb ]    fig7.eps    [ ptbptb ]    fig8.eps      in an attempt to map the attractor basins in more detail , we generated configurations at specified initial hamming distances from particular memory patterns . this was done by starting with a pattern @xmath59 and flipping the signs of a specified number of randomly chosen bits .  using an ensemble of such initial conditions , we measured the probability of retrieval of the target pattern @xmath59 as a function of the initial distance from it .  as a rule , the probability of recognizing the pattern is high if only a few signs are flipped , but drops sharply if a certain threshold hamming distance is exceeded . we are interested in learning where this threshold lies , and thus answering the question of how close an initial condition must be to a pattern in order to be attracted to it . we are also interested in the fate of states lying just outside the boundaries of a basin of attraction . in other words , does the basin share a boundary with the basins of other patterns , or only with spurious attractors ? the results are presented in figure [ boundaries ] for a bgn with @xmath26 and @xmath27 , for the three values @xmath212 and @xmath213 , and also for the hn .  in each of these cases , we generated an ensemble of initial conditions at a particular initial value of @xmath201 for some pattern . each initial condition was allowed to evolve under the dynamics and the resulting attractor was classified as :  a )  the target pattern @xmath214 b )  one of the other patterns @xmath215  c ) a spin glass spurious state or  d )  an uncondensed state .  in this case , we classified a state as uncondensed  if no sign flips occured during the dynamical evolution . the probabilities of each of these four outcomes were averaged over several realizations of the random patterns and plotted as functions of the initial bit overlap @xmath201 . [ ptb ]    fig9.eps    consider first the hn data from figure [ boundaries]d . a pattern can evidently be retrieved even if the initial overlap is fairly small ; the probability is close to unity if @xmath216 . if the target pattern is not retrieved , then either a spurious attractor or one of the other patterns may be retrieved . there is a range of @xmath217 over which all three probabilities are significant , indicating that the basins for the memory states border on each other as well as those of spurious states .  for an @xmath26 network , the expected magnitude of the overlap of a random state with any given one of the stored patterns is @xmath218 ,  which is not much smaller than the apparent threshold of @xmath219  this is consistent with the view that for the hn ,  a pattern is likely to be retrieved as long as the initial overlap with that pattern is significantly larger than all of the other overlaps . the @xmath159 bgn ( figure [ boundaries]c )  shares the qualitative features of the hn . note however that the probability of becoming trapped in a spurious state is smaller for the bgn , consistent with the results in figure [ attractorprobs ] . a contrasting case is the @xmath196 bgn ( figure [ boundaries]a ) .  in this case retrieval of the target pattern requires an initial overlap of more than 0.5 . although this represents a significant basin , it is highly unlikely that a _ random _ initial condition will have such a large overlap , thus explaining why random initial conditions almost never flow to a memory state .  the basins of the memory states are bordered only by spurious states , not by other memory states . interestingly , the states which lie adjacent to the basin of a memory pattern are not all uncondensed some are spurious states of the mixture or spin glass type . examination of the states retrieved near the boundary shows that these are typically _ asymmetric _ mixture states with one large overlap and two or more smaller ( but greater than random ) overlaps . finally , for @xmath193 ( figure [ boundaries]b ) ,  the basins of the memory state are almost as large as in the hn case ,  and near the boundaries there is a small but nonzero probability of retrieving one of the other memory patterns , indicating that the basins of different memory states almost touch each other .       taken together , the above results suggest a qualitative , schematic picture of the energy landscape illustrated in figures [ landscape05]-[landscape2 ] . the representation of the configuration space by two dimensions is not to be taken literally , since it is of course @xmath3-dimensional .  at low values of @xmath8 , such as 0.5 , the energy landscape is dominated by uncondensed states , which form a series of shallow basins , each limited to roughly a single orthant of @xmath3-dimensional space . these are represented in the diagram by a series of shallow pits . the basins of attraction for the retrieval and mixture states form isolated depressions in this pitted plateau . they occupy nontrivial volumes but do not lie adjacent to each other ( with the exception of certain spin glass states which lie near the retrieval states ) . at intermediate values @xmath220 ,  the basins of attraction of the retrieval states are much larger and in some places almost touch each other ,  but significant islands of uncondensed states remain .  by @xmath221 , however , the uncondensed states have disappeared and the basins of attraction for the other two types of states occupy the entire energy landscape and share boundaries with each other . [ ptb ]    fig10.eps    [ ptbptb ]    fig11.eps    [ ptbptbptb ]    fig12.eps we have studied the behaviour of the bistable gradient network in the thermodynamic low - loading limits @xmath37 , @xmath38 . we described and classified the attractors of the dynamics and also observed the effectiveness of pattern retrieval as a function of the coupling parameter @xmath8 . we found that states corresponding to perfect retrieval of the stored patterns are linearly stable at all values of @xmath8 , and have an energy that decreases monotonically with @xmath8 .  above the threshold @xmath222 the retrieval states become stable against sign flips of one or more nodes , and the network begins to function as an associative memory .  if @xmath8 is not far above this threshold , then the basins of attraction of the retrieval states are small and input must be very close in hamming distance to a pattern for recognition to occur . the basins of attraction of the retrieval states grow as @xmath8 increases . there are two regimes of behaviour , distinguished by the types of attractors that occur .  at low @xmath8 the configuration space is dominated by the uncondensed states , or states in which no node experiences a field strong enough to overcome its potential barrier .  in these states , @xmath145 remains close to 1 for all nodes ,  and the energy remains close to @xmath197 . each of these states occupies a basin of attraction confined to approximately a single orthant .  in the limit @xmath84 there are @xmath223 such states , all degenerate in energy .  as @xmath8 increases above the threshold @xmath91 , the retrieval states and the mixture or spin glass states at first occupy small isolated basins among the many uncondensed states .  however ,  as @xmath8 increases further , these basins grow until they lie adjacent to each other .  at some value of @xmath8 ( observed to lie between 1 and 1.5 ) , the uncondensed states disappear and there is a transition to a hopfield - like regime where the basins of attraction for retrieval  and spin glass states cover the whole configuration space . as @xmath8 increases still further ,  the retrieval basins grow at the expense of the spin glass states , so that the latter can be noticeably suppressed compared to the deterministic hopfield case . this suppression of the spurious states occurs without thermal noise or a modification of the hebb learning rule . the uncondensed states represent a phase which is neither `` ferromagnetic '' ( i , e , strongly ordered and correlated with one pattern ) nor `` glassy '' in the sense that frustration is an important effect ,  yet they can not properly be described as `` paramagnetic , ''  as paramagnetism is characterized by spins which are able to flip freely from one orientation to the other . a few words on the application of such networks to practical problems of associative memory are in order . the goal of associative memory is to reconstruct a pattern from a more or less corrupted version or from a fragment of the pattern , without becoming trapped in a spurious local minimum .  from this point of view , it appears that increasing @xmath8 improves the performance of the network expanding the basins of attraction for the retrieval states and suppressing the spurious states . the low-@xmath8 regime , on the other hand , may be suited to applications where the goal is a _ selective _ associative memory ,  one which only recognizes a pattern from a fairly close approximation and thus avoids false recognition .  in the low-@xmath8 regime , if the input is not close to one of the stored patterns , then the network is likely to remain in an uncondensed state . these can in general be distinguished clearly from other states ( especially retrieval states ) by their relatively high energy ( @xmath224 )  or by the fact that the magnitudes of all @xmath149 remain close to 1 . the magnitudes of the outputs can therefore be read as a signal of whether recognition has occurred . persistence in an uncondensed state corresponds to an i do nt know  or nonrecognition response .     in a subsequent publication , we will examine the behavior of the bgn when the loading level @xmath225 is of order unity , and we will demonstrate another performance trade - off .  specifically , we will show that the maximum storage capacity of the network decreases as @xmath8 increases .  for a low-@xmath8 regime , it is possible to stabilize more memorized patterns than in the hopfield case , while at higher @xmath8 , even though the low - loading fault tolerance is increased , the storage capacity decreases . w. hohmann , m. krauss and f.w . schneider , j. phys . a * 103 * , 7606 ( 1999 ) ;

"in quantum information applications based on optically addressed atoms or ions it is often necessary to prepare these elements in specific hyperfine or zeeman spin levels . typically this involves optical pumping from one ground - state spin level to another via an excited state . the preparation of the ions into a single well - defined state ( spin polarization ) is a required initial step for quantum memory protocols based on electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) @xcite , raman interactions @xcite and photon echoes using controlled reversible inhomogeneous broadening ( crib ) @xcite or atomic frequency combs ( afc ) @xcite . in particular , the implementation of these protocols in rare earth ( re ) ion doped solids @xcite requires spectral tailoring of the inhomogeneous absorption in order to isolate narrow absorption peaks .    among the various physical systems that have been considered for photonic quantum state storage , erbium doped solids provide a unique system where a large number of stationary atoms can coherently absorb photons at the telecommunication wavelength of 1.53 @xmath4 m . quantum memories at telecommunication wavelengths are required for a range of efficient quantum repeater protocols @xcite . in addition , erbium doped solids have exceptional optical coherence properties . an optical coherence time as long as 6.4 ms has been measured in er@xmath5:y@xmath0sio@xmath1 @xcite , which represents the longest optical coherence time measured in a solid . another interesting property of er@xmath5 is that it is a kramers ion with an odd number of electrons . this results in a large splitting between the ground state levels via a first order zeeman interaction , which leads to a larger accessible frequency bandwidth for quantum memory applications . however , the unquenched electronic spin of kramers ions results in strong spin - spin and spin - phonon interactions as compared to non kramers ions such as pr and eu . therefore the ground state population relaxation times are much shorter than in non kramers ions , usually in the range of tens to hundreds of ms @xcite . in order to achieve a high degree of population transfer via optical pumping it is necessary for the ground state lifetime to be much longer than the excited state lifetime . achieving efficient population transfer in erbium doped materials seems thus particularly challenging . the spectroscopic properties of er@xmath5:y@xmath0sio@xmath1 have been extensively studied , including optical coherence @xcite , spectral diffusion @xcite , hyperfine structure @xcite , zeeman relaxation lifetimes @xcite , zeeman g factors @xcite and erbium - host interactions @xcite . slow light has also been achieved in this material using coherent population oscillation @xcite . however , to our knowledge no study has been reported on the possibility to implement efficient population transfer between the two zeeman ground states to achieve a high degree of spin polarization .    in this article we investigate optical pumping between ground state zeeman levels of erbium ions doped into a y@xmath6sio@xmath7 crystal . we first observe the limitation of standard optical pumping . for er@xmath5y@xmath0sio@xmath1 an optical relaxation time of 11 ms @xcite and a zeeman relaxation lifetime of about 130 ms ( at a magnetic field of 1.2 mt ) @xcite have been measured . the low ratio between these two relaxation lifetimes strongly limits the achievable population transfer efficiency . another limiting factor is the branching ratio between the two optical transitions connecting the two ground state zeeman levels . we then show how an enhancement of the optical pumping efficiency can be achieved by decreasing the excited state lifetime via optical stimulated emission and by improving spin branching ratios via radio frequency ( rf ) excitation . these techniques allow population transfer between the two zeeman states with less than 10@xmath2 of the total population remaining in the initial state , i.e. more than 90@xmath2 spin polarization . we also demonstrate spectral tailoring in this crystal by preparing a narrow absorption line inside wide transparency window ( spectral pit ) , as required for the crib quantum memory scheme . population transfer between the two closely spaced ground state levels of a @xmath8-system can be achieved by optical pumping via the excited state level . in an optical pumping experiment , atoms are excited by a laser in resonance with the transition connecting one of the ground state to the excited state . the excited atoms can then decay into both ground states . those which have decayed to the ground state which is not connected to the laser will in principle remain there for a time corresponding to the relaxation time between the ground states . if enough pumping cycles can be done within this time , the population from the initial ground state can be entirely transferred to the second ground state . the efficiency of this transfer is thus limited by the ratio of the excited state lifetime ( @xmath9 ) and the spin population lifetime of the ground state levels ( which we label @xmath10 , since in our case the ground state levels are zeeman levels ) as well as the branching factor @xmath11 . the latter is defined as the probability of the ion to relax into its initial state via spontaneous emission . transition ( solid line ) . the probe transitions ( dashed lines ) are labelled and the positions of the corresponding holes and antiholes in the transmission spectrum are shown below . the zeeman splitting of the ground and the excited state level , respectively , is given by @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the g factors for the ground and the excited state , respectively , @xmath15 is the bohr magneton and @xmath16 the magnetic field . note that in addition to those shown in the figure , further side- and antiholes occur that are due to the inhomogeneous broadening of the absorption line @xcite . b ) to enhance the efficiency of the population transfer the excited state lifetime is artificially lowered by stimulated emission to the short - lived second kramers doublet of the ground state ( z@xmath0 ) . ]    in materials with inhomogeneous broadening , population transfer by optical pumping is usually realized and investigated with spectral holeburning ( shb ) techniques . in this scheme , the pump laser of frequency @xmath17 ( in resonance with transition 1 , fig . [ levelscheme]a ) is focused on the sample for a duration @xmath18 , the burning time . ions that are in resonance with @xmath17 are transferred to the excited state . in order to probe the transmission , a weak pulse follows after a delay @xmath19 during which the frequency of the laser is scanned around @xmath17 ( see fig . [ setup ] b ) . the inhomogeneously broadened absorption shows a spectral hole at @xmath17 which in general decays with the excited state lifetime @xmath9 . some of the ions will however relax into the second ground state zeeman level . if the temperature is low enough ( @xmath20 k ) such that zeeman levels are thermally decoupled @xcite , the population of this level will then be increased and the absorption at @xmath21 ( transition 4 in fig . [ levelscheme ] a ) will be enhanced . this enhancement is called a spectral anti - hole . it will decay with the zeeman lifetime @xmath10 . as long as the population in the two zeeman levels has not relaxed to thermal equilibrium , a part of the spectral hole at @xmath22 will persist . in case of a population transfer the hole should thus show two different decay times : @xmath9 from ions that decay from the excited back to the initial state and @xmath10 from ions that relax into the second zeeman level . the occurrence of the anti - hole and the long decay time ( @xmath10 ) for the central hole apparently provide evidence of population transfer . throughout this article we speak of this method as the standard optical pumping scheme . the intensity of the transmitted light is given by @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the intensity of the incident radiation , and @xmath25 the length of the sample . the absorption coefficient @xmath26 , i.e. the logarithm of the transmitted intensity , gives rise to the relation between the number of ions @xmath27 in the ground and the excited state . @xmath28 is the cross - section of the transition and can be considered as a constant . since in this work rather the population than the measured intensities themselves are of interest , all curves that deal with quantities related to the absorption and transmission , respectively , ( such as the area or the depth of a spectral hole ) are given with respect to the natural logarithm of the measured intensity .    to qualitatively understand the limiting factors in the population transfer process , one can use a simple rate equation model for a three level @xmath8 system . for the steady state in the case of standard optical pumping ( see appendix ) it is easy to derive that the ratio of populations in the ground states after optical pumping depends on the ratio between the zeeman lifetime @xmath10 and the excited state lifetime @xmath9 :    @xmath29    where @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) is the population fraction in the initial ( final ) zeeman state . however , this holds only for the case in which all of the excited ions relax into the desired level . in re - doped solids the selection rule for the electronic spin @xmath32 normally is only slightly lifted by the crystal field and only a small part of the ions can be found in this decay channel . this motivates to introduce an effective lifetime in the following manner : @xmath33 the branching factor @xmath34 being the probability that an ion will preserve its electron spin upon relaxation from the excited to the ground state . if @xmath11 is low , the pump rate has to be accordingly high to transfer population into the excited state . on the other hand a low branching factor is desirable if one wants the ions to relax into the second zeeman level . the ratio between ions in either of the two ground state levels is then given by @xmath35 ( see appendix ) . in previous measurements on er@xmath5:y@xmath0sio@xmath1 an excited state lifetime of @xmath36ms and a branching factor @xmath370.9 were found @xcite . this leads to an effective lifetime of @xmath38 ms which is of the same order as @xmath39 130 ms @xcite . according to the model it is thus impossible to perform efficient population transfer between the zeeman ground states of er@xmath5:y@xmath0sio@xmath1 using standard optical pumping . however , by looking at eq.[lifetimeratio ] and eq . [ efflifetimeratio ] , one can devise methods to increase the efficiency of the population transfer . a first idea is to improve the lifetime ratio by artificially increasing the decay rate from the excited state . this can be achieved by using stimulated emission to another short lived ground state level ( see fig.[levelscheme]b ) as proposed in @xcite . the corresponding results are presented in section [ stimulated ] . another possibility is to improve the branching ratio by mixing the spin level in the excited state using a radio frequency ( rf ) excitation . this technique is presented in section [ spin ] . the crystal , y@xmath0sio@xmath1 doped with er@xmath5 ( 10ppm ) , belongs to the crystal space group c@xmath40 . the er@xmath5 ions replace y@xmath5 ions and occupy two crystallographic inequivalent sites of c@xmath41 symmetry ( site 1 and site 2 ) @xcite . all measurements in this work were performed on ions at site 1 . the relevant transition is from the @xmath42i@xmath43 to the @xmath42i@xmath44 level , which are split into eight ( z@xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 labelling the lowest crystal field level ) and seven ( y@xmath45 , @xmath48 ) kramers doublets , respectively . all measurements were carried out on the z@xmath49 y@xmath50 transition having a wavelength of 1536 nm . under a magnetic field each of the crystal field levels splits into two zeeman levels ( @xmath51 . the y@xmath0sio@xmath1 crystal has three mutually perpendicular optical - extinction axis labelled @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 . the direction of light propagation is chosen parallel to the @xmath54-axis . the crystal was cut along these axes and its dimensions were 3 mm @xmath55 3.5 mm @xmath55 4 mm along @xmath54 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 , respectively . the magnetic field was applied in the @xmath52-@xmath53 plane . in this case all ions of each site are magnetically equivalent @xcite . the angle of the magnetic field is defined with respect to the @xmath52-axis ( see fig . [ setup ] c ) . if not mentioned explicitly all measurements were taken at an angle of @xmath56 . nm ) and the stimulation laser ( @xmath57 nm ) could be intensity modulated independently with acousto - optic modulators ( aom ) . they where coupled into the same fiber via a wave division multiplexer ( wdm ) . the light of the stimulation laser was filtered out before detection using another wdm . an rf - wave could be applied on the crystal using a coil in helmholtz configuration which could be driven with an arbitrary function generator ( afg ) . b ) typical pulse sequence . during the readout pulse the frequency of the pump laser was scanned in order to record the absorption profile . for measurement with stimulated emission , the stimulation laser is applied for a time @xmath58 , where @xmath59 can be varied . c ) illustration of the angle of the magnetic field with respect to the crystal orientation ]    . the experimental setup is shown in figure [ setup]a . the crystal was placed on the cold finger of a liquid helium cryostat ( janis st400 ) and could be cooled down to a temperature of about 2 k. all measurements , if not mentioned differently , were taken at 2.1 k. for optical pumping we used an external cavity diode laser ( toptica , @xmath60 nm ) which was operated in free run mode and its jitter within the relevant timerange was @xmath61 1 mhz . for stimulated emission experiments a tunable diode laser ( nettest , @xmath57 nm ) was at our disposal . it was amplified with an erbium doped fiber amplifier ( edfa ) and could be tuned over a wide range . both lasers could be gated independently using acousto - optical modulators ( aom ) and arbritrary function generators ( afg ) . they were coupled into the same optical fiber via a wavelength division multiplexer ( wdm ) . the light was focused into the crystal ( diameter of focus ( @xmath62 ) @xmath63 m ) . in order to avoid a large background in the detection due to fluorescence from the edfa the stimulation laser was filtered out after passing the cryostat using a second wdm . the transmitted light was measured with a photodiode ( newfocus 2011 ) . furthermore a helmholtz coil placed around the crystal was at our disposal and could be used to apply rf - pulses to the sample . the first series of measurements was made with standard optical pumping ( c.f . section [ theory ] ) in order to estimate the original efficiency of the population transfer . a spectral hole was created by sending a resonant pump pulse of 200 ms into the crystal . the dynamics of the hole was then measured by probing it at different delays . the circles in figure [ nostimnorf ] show the decay of the spectral hole using standard optical pumping . the dashed line is a fit to the data given by the sum of two exponential decays with rates of @xmath64 and @xmath65 , respectively .     of 11 ms . the line is a fit to the data . only a small fraction of the ions was transferred into the second zeeman level and provides a slow component ( @xmath39100 ms ) to the decline . the origin of the slowly decaying part is confirmed by the slight enhancement in the optical depth ( anti - holes ) left and right of the wide spectral hole ( pit ) in the inset . the graph shows a zoom on the absorption line at about @xmath66 ms after the burning pulse . here the frequency of the pump laser was sweeped by 10 mhz during the burning pulse in order to widen the hole . ] the decay is clearly dominated by the excited state lifetime @xmath67=11ms . the contribution of the decay with @xmath10 is low which leads to the conclusion that only a very small fraction of the ions could be transferred to the second zeeman level of z@xmath41 . this assumption is confirmed by the hole burning spectrum shown in the inset of fig . [ nostimnorf ] . for this measurement , a 10 mhz frequency sweep was applied to the pump laser , in order to widen the spectral hole . the enhancement of absorption at @xmath68 mhz ( fig . [ levelscheme ] ) is low , in contrast to what one would expect in the case of an efficient transfer of population . these observations show that the created spectral hole is mostly due to a storage of population in the excited state . thus , as expected from the arguments given in section [ theory ] , optical pumping alone does not suffice to prepare the system into the required state .      a first possible solution to improve the optical pumping efficiency is to artificially increase the decay rate from the excited state by stimulating the emission to another short lived ground state level ( see fig . [ levelscheme]b ) @xcite . for this purpose , a second laser in resonance with the transition y@xmath69 z@xmath0 ( 1546 nm , @xcite ) is applied simultaneously with the pump laser . due to a strong coupling to phonon modes , mostly due to direct phonon emission , the excited crystal field levels ( z@xmath0 , z@xmath70 , ... ) have non - radiative decay times in the range of nano- or picoseconds . thus , population from these levels will immediately relax into ground state ( z@xmath41 ) . we first characterize the stimulation process by measuring its dependence on the frequency of the stimulation laser . since the homogeneous broadening of the transition is expected to be larger than the inhomogeneous broadening @xcite , due to the short non - radiative decay times , this gives a direct measure of the homogeneous linewidth . it has been done by measuring the size of the spectral hole as a function of the frequency of the stimulation laser at 4.1 k. at this temperature the ground state zeeman levels are thermally coupled @xcite and therefore only ions in the excited state ( i.e. ions that have not been stimulated down ) contribute to the hole . the results are shown in fig . [ stimfreq ] . for this measurement , the stimulation pulse was 1 ms longer than the pump pulse . we see that when the stimulation laser is in resonance , the spectral hole almost completely vanishes , which shows that one can efficiently empty the excited state using this method . we find the linewidth to be about 14 ghz , which corresponds to a lifetime in the picosecond range . this is 9 orders of magnitude shorter than the zeeman lifetime and confirms that the z@xmath0-level is suitable for the application described above . k. the burning time was 200 ms . the stimulation pulse was 1 ms longer than the burning pulse . the delay for the readout pulse was set to 2.5 ms . the solid line is a lorentzian fit giving a full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of 14 ghz . ] another quantity of interest is the rate at which stimulation laser moves the ions down from the excited to the ground state ( z@xmath0 ) . to measure this quantity a pump pulse with @xmath71 100ms was sent into the sample . the crystal temperature was chosen to be 4.3 k so that also in this case the size of the hole would only be given by the fraction of ions that remained in the excited state . simultaneously to the pump pulse a stimulation pulse with a duration @xmath58 was applied ( see figure [ setup]b ) . the size of the remaining hole as a function of @xmath59 was recorded and the data was fitted with an exponential decay of which the stimulation rate could be extracted . the inset of fig . [ stimulation ] shows this data for three different values of applied stimulation power . each of the lines is a fit to the respective data . note that there is an offset which has its origin in long - lived holes that occur even at this temperature for a small subset of ions @xcite . it was set to be the same for all curves . the stimulation rate as a function of the stimulation power is plotted in fig . [ stimulation ] . as one would expect the stimulation rate increases linearly with power . for this measurement , the maximal power of the stimulation laser on the sample was 20 mw and it was limited by the maximal output power of the edfa . the measurements were taken with a magnetic field of 27,4 mt at an angle of @xmath72 with the @xmath52-axis . the average beam diameter ( @xmath62 ) in the crystal was 83 @xmath73 . z@xmath0 transition vs. applied laser power . the rate at which ions are stimulated down grows linearly with the power of the stimulation laser . it was extracted from the decay curves shown in the inset and as described in the text . curves for three different values of the power of the stimulation laser are shown . each data set is normalized to its maximum value ( @xmath74 ) . the offset of 0.1 is due to persistent holes which have already been observed and discussed in @xcite.,width=340 ]    let us now investigate the effect of stimulated emission on the population transfer by optical pumping . in fig . [ application ] one can see that the application of the stimulation laser simultaneously with the pump laser indeed leads to a significant enhancement of the transfer efficiency . the decay of the spectral hole at a temperature of 2.1 k is shown for the case of standard optical pumping ( open circles ) and optical pumping assisted by stimulated emission ( plain triangles ) . for standard optical pumping , the decay is dominated by the time constant @xmath9=11ms as explained in section [ standard ] . in contrast , the decay for the stimulated optical pumping is dominated by a slower decay time , which corresponds to @xmath75 ms . this indicates that a significant part of the population is now transferred to the other zeeman level by the optical pumping process . ms and the overall decay shows a much stronger contribution of this slow component than it can be observed for standard optical pumping . the enhancement in population transfer is confirmed by the strong anti - holes shown in the inset . the stimulation power the figure shows the absorption at about @xmath76 ms after the burning pulse . for this measurement , a 10 mhz sweep was applied on the pump laser and the stimulation pulse was 1 ms longer than the pump pulse and the stimulation power in front of the cryostat was 50 mw . ]    this hypothesis is confirmed by directly measuring the residual absorption after the optical pumping , as shown in the inset of fig . [ application ] . in order to obtain a reference for the transmission out of resonance , the entire inhomogeneously broadened absorption line was measured ( only a zoom is shown ) . a spectral pit was created using stimulated optical pumping by sweeping the frequency of the pump laser over a range of 10 mhz while burning . for this measurement , the stimulation pulse was 1 ms longer than the pump pulse in order to de - excite population remaining in the excited state to the ground state . therefore the transparency in the central pit is mostly due to ions transferred to the other ground state . the optical depth without optical pumping is @xmath771 , while the residual optical depth after population transfer is @xmath78 0.25 . the enhanced absorption which occurs in form of wide anti - holes on both sides of the pit confirms , as explained in section [ theory ] , that the population was transferred as intended . from this measurement , it is possible to estimate the efficiency of the population transfer . the fraction of ions remaining in the initial zeeman state @xmath79 can be estimated by : @xmath80 0.25 . since initially the two zeeman states are equally populated , this means that 12.5 @xmath2 of the total number of atoms is remaining in the initial state , within the frequency range optically pumped . if one assumes that all atoms that are not in the initial state have been transferred to the other zeeman level , on can compute the ratio @xmath81=7 . this is much lower than what can be expected from the simple model presented in section [ theory ] ( see also appendix ) . this shows that , while the model presented helps to understand the process of optical pumping , it is too simplified to give quantitative estimations . although stimulated optical pumping greatly increases the population transfer efficiency , the fraction of ions remaining in the initial ground state is still high . this is in part due to the high value of the branching factor @xmath11 for this transition . in ref . @xcite , @xmath11 was estimated to be larger than 0.9 for a magnetic field applied at @xmath82 ( see fig . [ setup ] c ) , from comparison between experimental data and numerical simulations . this means that the spin is conserved to a high degree during the decay from the excited state . from the measurement of the last section , this seems to hold even for decay through the the state z@xmath6 , which involves phononic relaxation . in this section , we present a technique to improve the branching ratio for optical pumping applications . an idea to overcome this problem in general is to artificially change the spin by mixing the population of the two zeeman levels of the excited state using rf excitation . for this purpose a pair of helmholtz coils mm , length of each coil @xmath83 3 mm , distance between coils @xmath83 3 mm , 3 turns on each side . the central axis was parallel to the axis of light propagation . ] was placed around the crystal ( see fig . [ setup]a ) . note that a difference of the g - factors for the ground- and the excited state is necessary in order not to mix the spin population of the ground state levels as well . in er@xmath5:y@xmath0sio@xmath1 @xmath84 and @xmath85 ( for @xmath86 at an angle of @xmath56 , [ setup ] c ) @xcite . for electronic spins with such large g - factors , the magnetic dipole moment of the spin transition is large ( @xmath4=112 mhz / mt ) , so that significant mixing can be obtained with moderate rf - power . the rf pulse was applied simultaneously with the pump pulse ( duration 200 ms ) . a 1 @xmath4s long linear frequency sweep was continuously repeated during the burning process . due to the inhomogeneity of the external magnetic field the bandwidth , i.e. the size of the sweep , had to be chosen high ( 10 - 20 mhz ) . the required central frequency corresponds to @xmath87 in figure [ levelscheme ] and could be extracted from a hole - burning spectrum . the effect of the rf mixing was measured by estimating the fraction of atoms remaining in the initial state after optical pumping , similarly to the measurement made in section [ stimulated ] . for this measurement however , both stimulated emission and rf excitation were applied . [ rf - power ] shows the fraction of the total number of atoms remaining in the initial state as a function of the rf voltage . a significant enhancement of the transfer due to the rf - wave can be observed . this enhancement , however , is quickly saturated when increasing the rf - power . this might be explained by the achievement of an equilibrium between the population of the two zeeman levels . the inset of fig.[rf - power ] shows a zoom of the spectral pit created with and without rf mixing . for this measurement , the number of atoms in the initial state was 8 @xmath2 , as compared to 12.5 @xmath2 without rf mixing applied ( sec . [ stimulated ] ) . hence , a spin polarization of 92 @xmath2 within the optically pumped bandwith has been achieved .      : y@xmath0sio@xmath1 ( black curve ) : a narrow absorption line ( fwhm 2 mhz ) could be established inside a spectral pit ( fwhm 50 mhz ) . an interesting feature is that the structure written into the absorption can as well be observed in the corresponding anti - holes , which again confirms the population transfer into the second zeeman level of the ground state . the gray curve corresponds to the inhomogeneous absorption without the state preparation sequence . for further details see text . ]    the ability to tailor the absorption profile is important for quantum memory proposals such as crib or afc , as well as proposals for quantum logic gates in re doped solids @xcite . to illustrate this capacity in er@xmath5:y@xmath0sio@xmath1 , we isolated a narrow absorption line within a large transparency window ( spectral pit ) , with the help of the two methods presented above . for this purpose , we used a simple technique consisting of sweeping the laser frequency during the 200 ms long pump pulse and gating off the pump laser for a short time at the center of the frequency sweep . the total frequency range was swept in 100 @xmath4s , resulting in 2000 frequency sweeps . an example of spectral tailoring is shown in fig . the width of the pit was 50 mhz while the absorption width of the peak at the center of the pit is 2 mhz . this is much broader than the homogeneous linewidth of the transition @xcite . the width of the peak is likely to be limited by the linewidth of our free - running laser , which is larger than 1 mhz for the timescale of the burning pulse . the fact that we sweep the laser frequency by scanning the laser current might also degrade the linewidth . stabilizing the laser frequency will be required in order to obtain narrower absorption peaks . furthermore , the use of more sophisticated hole burning techniques will also be needed @xcite in order to achieve absorption width in the khz range . although the methods developed in this paper allow a significant improvement of population transfer efficiency as compared to standard optical pumping , there is still a residual absorption in the spectral pit . this will act as a passive loss for light storage protocols . further efforts will thus be needed in order to optimize light storage efficiency . note however that the width of the spectral pit ( 50 mhz ) is much larger than what can be achieved in non - kramers ions that have been used for such purposes so far , such as praesodymium @xcite or europium @xcite . this shows the potential of er doped solids for obtaining large frequency bandwidths for quantum storage applications . erbium doped solids are promising candidates for the implementation of quantum memories at telecommunication wavelengths . we have shown and discussed the difficulties for state preparation by optical pumping in er@xmath5:y@xmath0sio@xmath1 , including the ratio between the excited state and the zeeman lifetimes and the branching factor @xmath11 . with stimulated emission assisted optical pumping and spin - mixing using rf excitations , we have investigated two methods to alleviate these problems . we have shown that their application indeed leads to a significant enhancement of the optical pumping efficiency . population transfer between two zeeman levels with less than 10@xmath2 of the total population in the initial level has been demonstrated . this corresponds to a spin polarization of 90@xmath2 . note that the techniques used here can also be applied to other rare earth doped solids . in particular , the might be useful to enhance optical pumping efficiency in other kramers ions , such as neodymium @xcite . further improvements might be obtained by increasing stimulation rates with higher laser powers and using coherent rf population transfer between the two excited states . another possibility to improve the branching ratio could be to apply the magnetic field at particular angles where the spin conservation selection rule is relaxed @xcite . in order to increase the population lifetime of zeeman levels , it might be interesting to work at higher magnetic field ( hundreds of mt ) , in order to reduce spin - spin interactions . other crystals might also be explored , e.g. y@xmath6o@xmath88 , to search for longer zeeman lifetimes . finally , it would also be interesting to investigate hyperfine states , which might have longer spin population relaxation lifetimes @xcite . we also demonstrated spectral tailoring in er@xmath5:y@xmath0sio@xmath1 by isolating a narrow absorption peak within a wide transparency window , as required for the crib quantum memory scheme . although further progress remains to be done to improve the population transfer efficiency with higher optical depth , the achievement of spectral tailoring in erbium doped solids will allow proof of principle experiments of light storage with quantum memory protocols . hence , with this work a further step towards a solid state based quantum memory at telecom wavelength has been accomplished . we would like to thank marko lovric and roman kolesov for their advice concerning the design of the rf - setup . furthermore would we like to thank the group of prof . d. van der marel , mehdi brandt , d. van mechelen , and violeta guritanu for experimental assistance , as well as prof . m. chergui ( epfl ) for loaning us the cryostat . tecnical support by c. barreiro and j.d . gauthier is acknowledged . this work was supported by the swiss nccr quantum photonics and the european commission under the integrated project qubit applications ( qap ) funded by the ist directorate . the low efficiency of the population transfer was ascribed to the the ratio between the excited state lifetime @xmath9 and the ground state zeeman lifetime @xmath10 as well as the branching factor @xmath11 . the corresponding formulas ( [ lifetimeratio ] and [ efflifetimeratio ] , section [ theory ] ) were found using the following simple rate equation model :        let @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 be the population fraction in the two ground and in the excited state , respectively , as shown in figure [ popratio ] . the laser is in resonance with the transition between level 1 and 3 . for the population of the second zeeman ground state level the population dynamics is given by @xmath92 @xmath93 is the einstein - coefficient for spontaneous emission @xmath94 and @xmath95 are the spin - lattice - relaxation rates . in the case considered by gorju et al . @xcite a term which corresponds to @xmath94 does not occur since the target state is a crystal field level and the relevant phonon decay is a one way process . however , the calculations are still quite similar . in the steady state it is @xmath96    where the second equality holds for the case of sufficiently high pump power , i.e. a saturation of the considered transition . if we further assume @xmath97 , which is a good approximation since the thermal energy @xmath98 is much larger than the splitting between the two levels , it follows from equation [ dynamics ] that the ratio between the number of ions in either of the lower states is given by @xmath99 the factor 2 in the numerator of the lifetime ratio occurs since @xmath100 @xcite . so far it is assumed that all ions decay into the second zeeman level . in this case @xmath101 . however , one has to take into account that only a fraction of the ions in the excited state will do so . supposing that the excited state lifetime is given by @xmath102 with @xmath103 and with the definition of the branching factor @xmath104 ( which gives @xmath105 ) we can define the effective lifetime @xmath106 plugging this into equation [ ratio1app ] we get @xmath107      in the case of stimulated emission as presented in section [ stimulated ] the spontaneous emission rate @xmath108 has to be replaced with the stimulation rate @xmath109 . due to its extremely low lifetime , the role of the level z@xmath0 ( figure [ levelscheme ] ) can be neglected . according to equation [ ratio2app ] population ratio is now given by @xmath110 if one considers a branching factor @xmath111 and a stimulation rate of @xmath112khz , with a zeeman lifetime of 100 ms we compute a ratio of 71 , which is significantly higher ( @xmath113 one order of magnitude ) than found in the experiment . this can be explained by the fact that the model is extremely simplified as compared to reality . among others the role of other decay channels and the possibility of a different branching factor for a decay from the z@xmath0 level could not been taken into account . nevertheless , this model can help to understand the processes of optical pumping in the system qualitatively .","The text discusses the preparation and implementation of quantum memories in rare earth (RE) ion doped solids, specifically in the case of erbium doped solids.

"axial killing fields play an important role in classical general relativity when defining the angular momentum of a black hole or a similar compact , gravitating body . the simplest example is the komar angular momentum , which applies to regions of spacetime that admit a global axial killing field @xmath1 . the formula is @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a spacelike 2-sphere , @xmath4 is the area bivector normal to @xmath3 , @xmath5 is the extrinsic curvature of a cauchy surface @xmath6 containing @xmath3 , @xmath7 is the spacelike normal to @xmath3 within @xmath6 , and @xmath8 is the intrinsic area element on @xmath3 . similar integrals  such as the quasi - local formulae due to brown and york @xcite and for dynamical horizons @xcite  apply more generally , when only the _ intrinsic , two - dimensional _ metric on @xmath3 is symmetric . but the definition of each does rely on the existence of such an intrinsic symmetry .    in order to justify an integral like ( [ komar ] ) as a physical angular momentum , @xmath1 should have some standard , global characteristics of an axial killing field . in particular , for a general riemannian geometry @xmath9 , these characteristics include that    1 . @xmath1 vanishes at at least one fixed point @xmath10 , 2 . every orbit of the flow @xmath11 generated by @xmath1 is either a fixed point or a circle , and 3 . all of the circular orbits close only at integer multiples of a common period @xmath12 . one may then scale @xmath1 by a constant as needed so that @xmath13 , the standard period for a group of rigid rotations . the angular momenta mentioned above take unique values only when one restricts to this preferred normalization . if @xmath14 happens to be a ( topological ) 2-sphere , then condition ( a ) is usually strengthened to    1 . @xmath1 vanishes at exactly two fixed points @xmath15 and @xmath16 in @xmath14 . these conditions distill the intuitive , geometric features of axial symmetries in standard geometries ( _ i.e. _ , euclidean , gaussian , or lobachevskian ) . the purpose of this note is to show that the conditions above are redundant . the _ global _ conditions ( b ) and ( c )  as well as condition ( a ) when @xmath14  derive from condition ( a ) and one other _ local _ condition at @xmath15 , which is that @xmath17 that is , any killing field @xmath1 with at least one fixed point @xmath15 , whose derivative satisfies the local condition ( [ fcon ] ) , is necessarily an axial killing field in the global sense described above . furthermore , ( [ fcon ] ) _ always _ holds if @xmath18 is 2- or 3-dimensional , so in those cases any killing field with a fixed point is an axial killing field . finally , every vector field on a 2-sphere must vanish at at least one point , so every killing field on a 2-sphere is axial . condition ( a ) then follows by a topological argument . one can also show that conditions ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) hold whenever @xmath14 is a 2-sphere ( * ? ? ? * see  3 ) using the classical uniformization theorem : every metric @xmath19 on a 2-sphere is conformally related to a round metric @xmath20 . any killing field of @xmath19 must also be a killing field of @xmath20 , and therefore must satisfy conditions ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) . the approach we take here is more direct , and actually lays the foundation @xcite for a proof of the uniformization theorem via ricci flow @xcite . here we extend this direct approach to arbitrary riemannian geometries and highlight its utility in physical applications . the global flow @xmath11 generated by a killing field @xmath1 on a riemannian manifold @xmath9 is closely related to the corresponding inifnitesimal flow @xmath21 induced on the tangent space @xmath22 at any point @xmath15 where @xmath1 vanishes . the key point is that the latter form a subgroup of the symmetry group @xmath23 for the euclidean geometry @xmath24 . the natural flow @xmath21 in the tangent space at @xmath15 consists of the differentials @xmath25 of the diffeomorphisms @xmath11 in the global flow on @xmath18 . the differential of a diffeomorphism @xmath26 is just the natural push - forward map @xmath27 on vectors . if @xmath28 is fixed , then @xmath29 becomes a linear map from the tangent space @xmath30 to itself . furthermore , if @xmath31 is a global isometry of the riemannian geometry @xmath9 that fixes @xmath32 , then @xmath29 is a linear isometry of the euclidean geometry @xmath33 . it follows that @xmath34 is a one - parameter group of linear isometries of a eucliean vector space . they must be rotational isometries , not translational , because they fix the origin of @xmath22 . thus , each orbit of @xmath21 must either be a fixed point or a circle . this is the tangent - space analogue ( b@xmath35 ) of condition ( b ) above . next , recall that the lie derivative along @xmath1 of a vector field @xmath36 is defined in terms of the push - forward under the flow @xmath11 generated by @xmath1 : @xmath37_{t = 0}.\ ] ] when @xmath1 vanishes at @xmath38 , this determines the generator , in the ordinary sense of matrices , of the one - parameter group of linear isometries @xmath21 via @xmath39_{t = 0 }           = - \lie_\varphi\ , v^b \bigr|_{p_0 }          = v^a\ , \grad\!_a\ , \varphi^b \bigr|_{p_0}.\ ] ] thus , the tensor @xmath40 from ( [ fcon ] ) generates the rotations @xmath21 in @xmath22 in the sense that @xmath41 one can always find an orthonormal basis for @xmath24 that puts an anti - symmetric tensor like @xmath40 in canonical , block - diagonal form with one or more @xmath42 anti - symmetric blocks along the diagonal , possibly followed by one or more zeroes . there can be at most one non - zero block if @xmath18 is 2- or 3-dimensional , but in higher dimensions there may be several . in principle , each block could have a different pair of values @xmath43 for its off - diagonal elements . but the period of @xmath44 within the 2-dimensional subspace of @xmath22 corresponding to one of these blocks is @xmath45 . these periods are equal if ( [ fcon ] ) holds because , working in the preferred basis , we have @xmath46 for each @xmath47 . thus , ( [ fcon ] ) yields the tangent - space analogue ( c@xmath35 ) of condition ( c ) . to summarize , the rigid , euclidean geometry of @xmath24 suffices to prove the tangent - space analogues of our claims above . more precisely , we have shown that    1 . the 1-parameter group of linear isometries @xmath21 fixes the origin in @xmath22 , _ whence _ 2 . every other orbit of @xmath21 in @xmath22 is either a fixed point or a circle , and 3 . all of those circular orbits close for a common period @xmath12 as long as ( [ fcon ] ) holds . in addition , ( [ fcon ] ) holds identically if @xmath18 is 2- or 3-dimensional . finally , note that the natural normalization of @xmath40 sets each @xmath48 , which is equivalent to @xmath49 this one normalization condition implies that _ all _ orbits of @xmath21 close at @xmath13 . the results in the tangent space @xmath22 extend back to the whole manifold @xmath18 essentially because the global isometries @xmath11 map geodesics of @xmath9 to other geodesics . recall the exponential map @xmath50 where @xmath51 denotes the unique geodesic of @xmath9 starting from @xmath52 , having initial tangent @xmath53 , and affinely parameterized so that @xmath54 for all @xmath55 . each global isometry @xmath11 maps this geodesic to another one , @xmath56 , which of course has its initial tangent rotated in @xmath22 . in short , @xmath57 for all @xmath58 and all @xmath59 . if @xmath18 is connected , compact , and without boundary , then there exists at least one geodesic between @xmath15 and any of its other points . it therefore follows from ( [ pcomm ] ) that every orbit of @xmath11 in @xmath18 must be the image under the exponential map of at least one orbit of @xmath21 in @xmath22 . the exponential generally is not invertible , of course , so the orbit in @xmath22 generally is not unique . but the orbits of @xmath11 can not intersect one another , or themselves , non - trivially . thus , although the exponential mapping of orbits may be many - to - one , and may map circular orbits of @xmath21 to fixed - point orbits of @xmath11 , it nonetheless preserves orbits . it follows in particular that each orbit of @xmath11 must either be a fixed point or a closed circle . in other words , condition ( b ) for the orbits of @xmath11 follows from condition ( b@xmath35 ) for the orbits of @xmath21 . it is also clear that every circular orbit of @xmath11 must close with the same period as one of the orbits of @xmath21 that is mapped to it by the exponential . but all orbits of @xmath21 have the same period as long as ( [ fcon ] ) holds , and condition ( c ) for the orbits of @xmath11 then follows from condition ( c@xmath35 ) for the orbits of @xmath21 .    let us summarize the chain of arguments here . condition ( a ) on a killing field on a riemannian geometry @xmath9 implies condition ( a@xmath35 ) for the linear isometries @xmath21 of the euclidean geometry @xmath24 . this in turn implies conditions ( b@xmath35 ) and ( c@xmath35 ) , as long as ( [ fcon ] ) holds . finally , these imply conditions ( b ) and ( c ) globally on @xmath18 via the exponential map . note that the _ local _ normalization condition ( [ fnorm ] ) at @xmath15 therefore dictates the _ global _ scaling of the killing field @xmath1 such that all of its orbits have the desired period @xmath13 . every vector field , and thus every killing field , on a 2-sphere @xmath3 vanishes at at least one point , and ( [ fcon ] ) holds identically in 2 dimensions . every killing field on a 2-sphere therefore satisfies conditions ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) . but the intuitive picture of an axial killing field on a 2-sphere is that it should vanish at exactly two poles , as in condition ( a ) , not just at a single point . we now show that this is necessarily the case . suppose that a 2-sphere geometry @xmath60 admits an axial killing field @xmath1 , which we take to be normalized according to ( [ fnorm ] ) . each point @xmath61 in @xmath3 lies on a unique orbit of @xmath1 , which divides the sphere into two regions . let @xmath62 denote the area of the region bounded by that orbit and containing the fixed point @xmath15 . equivalently @xcite , we may set @xmath63 the smooth function @xmath62 takes both maximum and minimum values somewhere on the ( compact ) sphere , and each must occur at a fixed point where @xmath64 vanishes . the minimum value is zero , and occurs only at @xmath38 . the maximum value @xmath65 also occurs at a fixed point @xmath16 , which can not coincide with @xmath15 because any fixed point of @xmath1 must be _ one - sided_. that is , the local topology of @xmath66 is that of the 2-dimensional plane , so the fixed points of @xmath1 must be isolated from one another , and each must be surrounded by a _ single _ family of circular orbits . ( if two distinct families of circular orbits surrounded a given fixed point , then @xmath3 would have the local topology of a two - sided cone there . ) similarly , every circular orbit of @xmath1 must be _ two - sided _ in the sense that there are exactly two distinct families of circular orbits surrounding it . ( there can not be only one such family because @xmath3 has no boundary , and there can not be more than two because this would violate the assumed manifold structure of @xmath3 at each point of such an orbit . ) the manifold of orbits @xmath67 of @xmath1 therefore has the topology of a closed interval @xmath68 $ ] , with exactly two fixed points at the two ends and only circular orbits in the interior . thus , @xmath1 must have exactly two isolated fixed points . finally , we show that the exponential map maps a closed disk with _ finite _ radius @xmath69 in @xmath70 onto _ all _ of @xmath3 , with the entire circular boundary of that disk mapped to the conjugate fixed point @xmath71 . this mapping is invertible in the interior of the disk , but obviously not on the boundary . to see this , observe that @xmath72{\dot\gamma_v(s ) } = 0      \qquad\text{and}\qquad      \grad\!_{\dot\gamma_v(s)}\ , \bigl ( \varphi \cdot \dot\gamma_v(s ) \bigr ) = 0\ ] ] because @xmath51 in ( [ expdef ] ) is an affinely parameterized geodesic and @xmath1 is a killing field . it follows that the tangent to @xmath51 has constant norm equal to @xmath73 for all @xmath55 and , since @xmath1 vanishes at @xmath15 , is everywhere orthogonal to the circular orbits of @xmath1 . the proper distance in @xmath3 along @xmath51 from @xmath15 to @xmath74 is therefore equal to @xmath73 in @xmath75 . ( this holds generally , not just on the 2-sphere . ) it also follows from ( [ gprop ] ) that the proper geodetic distance from @xmath15 to @xmath16 is @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the proper radius of the orbit of @xmath1 through any given point , and primes denote derivatives with respect to @xmath78 . this integral is irregular because @xmath79 vanishes at both endpoints . but the integral converges nonetheless because the conditions to avoid conical singularities in @xmath3 at @xmath15 and @xmath16 are @xmath80 thus , although @xmath81 diverges at both endpoints in ( [ sigint ] ) , the indefinite integral of @xmath82 vanishes like @xmath79 near @xmath83 . the difference @xmath84 likewise vanishes like @xmath79 near @xmath85 . there can be no other irregular points with @xmath86 , so the integral ( [ sigint ] ) is well - defined and @xmath69 is finite . we have seen that any killing field @xmath1 that vanishes at at least one point @xmath15 in a riemannian manifold @xmath9 , and satisfies ( [ fcon ] ) there , necessarily has only fixed - point and closed , circular orbits throughout @xmath18 , the latter all having the same period @xmath87 . this offers a convenient way to characterize axial killing fields in terms of local data at a fixed point . furthermore , scaling @xmath1 globally such that ( [ fnorm ] ) holds locally at @xmath15 guarantees that the period of every circular orbit is @xmath0 . the condition ( [ fcon ] ) is not needed in 2 or 3 dimensions , and in fact one might imagine abandoning it altogether for manifolds of arbitrary dimension . the main disadvantage of this would be that some orbits of @xmath21 may no longer be closed . rather , if some of the @xmath88 from ( [ fivals ] ) were incommensurate , some orbits @xmath21 would densely fill a torus in @xmath22 . the same would then apply to the orbits of @xmath11 by the same methods used above . although this would be rather less convenient , and less physical , such `` quasi - axial '' symmetries could potentially be interesting in certain applications . one additional feature of these results is that they suggest a natural and convenient way to normalize an _ approximate _ killing field on a riemannian geometry @xmath9 that has no actual symmetries @xcite . namely , suppose that a candidate approximate killing field @xmath89 can be found up to constant scaling on @xmath18 and vanishes at at least one point , which again is guaranteed if @xmath14 . then , one may define @xmath90}$ ] , and use ( [ fnorm ] ) to normalize @xmath89 throughout @xmath18 without having to compute the orbits of @xmath89 and ensure that they close , etc . we explore this proposal further in a companion paper @xcite .","Axial Killing fields play a crucial role in classical general relativity, particularly in defining the angular momentum of a compact, gravitating body.

"non - abelian stringlike solutions have a long history which starts already in 1973 with the nielsen - olesen seminal paper @xcite . several general discussions were published @xcite and explicit solutions ( numerical of course ) were obtained @xcite for an @xmath3 gauge theory with higgs fields in the adjoint representation which completely break the symmetry . however , the major part of the activity in the field of cosmic strings @xcite was concentrated on their abelian counterparts . one reason for this is that these non - abelian string solutions have their flux directed in a fixed direction in the corresponding algebra so they are essentially abelian .    in recent years , new kinds of non - abelian strings were discovered during attempts to understand the phenomenon of confinement in qcd @xcite , and their properties were studied extensively @xcite . these new solutions appear in models with a global ( flavor ) @xmath5 symmetry in addition to the @xmath3 local ( color ) symmetry based on scalar fields in the fundamental representation . they allow rotation of the non - abelian flux in the lie algebra , which makes them genuinely non - abelian . when @xmath6 these consist a generalization @xcite of the _ semilocal _ strings introduced originally within the extended abelian higgs model @xcite which is the higgs system with a global @xmath7 symmetry in addition to the local @xmath4 . we therefore term the model discussed here the `` extended non - abelian higgs model '' . most of the studies of these non - abelian string solutions up to now have been limited to the self - dual ( bps ) case . however , it is natural to go further and look for more general solutions as has just been done very recently @xcite . this is the direction which we will take in this work , namely going beyond the bps limit and it will be done together with allowing also for the possibility of rotation ( i.e. spinning solutions ) and of currents along the string axis . spinning and superconducting cosmic strings have been found recently @xcite in the extended abelian higgs model which gives rise also to the ( embedded ) nielsen - olesen solutions . these new semilocal solutions , known as _ twisted _ , occur mainly outside the very peculiar ( self - dual ) limit of the coupling constants where the equations of the theory admit bogomolnyi conditions . another outstanding feature of twisted semilocal strings is that , when they exist , there is a continuous family of them , labelled by the `` twist '' , a parameter entering through a space - time dependent relative phase of the higgs field components . note however the existence of the electro - weak superconducting strings @xcite which exist without a `` twist '' .    in the abelian case , the local string is characterized by a magnetic field concentrated in a tube along the symmetry axis . outside the core the magnetic field strength decays exponentially . the higgs field vanishes on the axis and reaches asymptotically its symmetry - breaking value .    for the twisted semilocal string the geometry is more involved . the magnetic and higgs fields behave roughly as for local string but the configuration supports in addition an azimuthal ( `` tangential '' ) component of the magnetic field . the source of this current is the additional higgs component ; its modulus is non - zero on the axis ( forming a condensate ) and vanishes outside the core and its phase is twisted . the effect of the non trivial phase can be appreciated once computing the gauge invariant noether currents and the magnetic field . figure [ magneticfield ] gives a pictorial representation of the effect of the twist . = 4.0 cm +    in this work we will present the non - abelian analogues of the abelian semilocal twisted strings and study their properties like current and angular momentum . untwisted purely magnetic local non - abelian strings will be discussed briefly as a special case . the field equations corresponding to the models presented here are non linear and coupled and do not admit explicit solutions . we therefore rely on numerical techniques to construct the solutions and calculate the physical quantities . several figures are necessary to illustrate the extreme richness of the solutions . the existence of these new kinds of strings raises the question of the nature of the gravitational fields of these strings and the possibility of new features in this respect . some initial work has been already done in this area @xcite  still for the bps case only and we will turn to that question in a future publication . another issue which is beyond the scope of this work is the effect of spin on the reconnection probability @xcite of non - abelian strings . this paper has the following plan . in section 2 we present the extended non - abelian higgs model and discuss its relation with its abelian counterpart . in section 3 we derive the field equations and obtain the physical quantities which are used to characterize the solutions : energy , angular momentum , currents and charges . in section 4 we present the various string solutions and discuss their properties across their parameter space . section 5 contains our conclusions . our general framework is based on a lagrangian describing a multiplet of @xmath0 scalar fields with local invariance under @xmath1 and a global invariance under @xmath5 . the local symmetry further requires @xmath8 non - abelian gauge fields and one abelian field . the scalar fields can be written in term of a matrix with elements @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 transforming according to @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are matrices in the fundamental representations of @xmath3 and @xmath5 respectively . the lagrangian is : @xmath15 the standard definitions are used for the covariant derivative and gauge field strengths  : @xmath16 @xmath17 where @xmath18 are the structure constants of the gauge group and @xmath19 are the ( hermitian ) generators in the fundamental representation . we use the normalization @xmath20 . the most general renormalizable symmetry breaking potential is @xmath21 where @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are positive constants . it can be written also as : @xmath25 the first term forces the scalar fields to develop a non - trivial minimum , while the second term forces the minimal configurations @xmath26 to be such that @xmath27 . this general system contains some well - known special cases , or seen from the other direction , may be considered as a generalization of several systems . from the point of view of the present discussion our model generalizes the extended abelian higgs model which corresponds to @xmath28 ( and @xmath29 , while @xmath0 is arbitrary ) in our terminology . in the abelian case , the second term of the potential vanishes identically . this model allows for two kinds of stable string solutions as was first discovered @xcite for the case @xmath30 . the first is just the embedded abelian ( nielsen - olesen ) flux tube which in these circumstances is stable @xcite for @xmath31 . the second is sometimes called `` skyrmion '' because of the relation with the @xmath32-model lumps @xcite and exists only in the self - dual limit where the masses of the higgs and the gauge particles are equal ( or @xmath33 ) . its stability is guaranteed by a bogomolnyi - type argument . both solutions are termed semilocal strings and their discovery was a surprise at the time , since the vacuum manifold of the model is a @xmath34- dimensional sphere which does not give rise to non - contractible loops . this discovery gave an explicit example for a system where the non - triviality of the first homotopy group of the vacuum manifold is not a necessary condition for the existence of stable string - like solutions . in this system , the kinetic ( gradient ) term plays a crucial role since it has a lower symmetry than the potential term , and it is this `` mismatch '' between the different symmetries which enables the existence of these solutions @xcite . the two kinds of solutions mentioned above are static , but stationary spinning semilocal strings also exist in this system , as well as solutions which carry a persistent current . these solutions @xcite belong to a new family of solutions named _ twisted _ semilocal strings . the `` twist '' is realized by a relative phase between the two higgs field components , which changes along the string axis and may be also time dependent . these twisted strings exist for @xmath35 and form a continuous family parametrized by this `` twist '' parameter . the main physical property of these twisted strings is the current along the string axis which exists in both the static and stationary cases and gives rise to azimuthal component of the magnetic field . their energy in their rest frame decreases with growing current which implies that they are energetically more favorable to be produced during ( cosmological ) phase transitions than the embedded abelian strings . these new solutions bifurcate with the embedded abelian flux tubes in the limit of vanishing current , thus clarifying the nature of the `` magnetic spreading '' instability @xcite of the embedded abelian flux tubes for @xmath35 . we look for cylindrically symmetric non - abelian stringlike solutions and for definiteness , we limit ourselves to the case @xmath36 . but , the ansatz presented below and the corresponding equations can be generalized easily .    the electromagnetic potential and its non - abelian counterpart will be : @xmath37 where @xmath38 belongs to the cartan subalgebra of the gauge group . for @xmath7 there is only one possibility , i.e. @xmath39 but already for @xmath40 which is a rank 2 group there is more freedom and @xmath38 is a linear combination of the two ( commuting ) diagonal gell - mann matrices . we will denote the diagonal elements of @xmath38 by @xmath41 with @xmath42 . for the scalar field we take : @xmath43 which follows ( and actually generalizes ) the form of @xcite or @xcite . the phases @xmath44 and @xmath45 will have linear dependence on @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 : @xmath49 and @xmath50 .    to write the field equations , it is convenient to use a dimensionless coordinate , to rescale the fields and `` phase parameters '' appropriately and to define a relative gauge coupling constant : @xmath51 with these dimensionless quantities , the field equations of the system are written below . for the scalar fields we obtain ( recall : @xmath41 are the diagonal elements of @xmath38 )  : @xmath52 \varphi_a \;\;\ ; , a < n\end{aligned}\ ] ]    @xmath53 \varphi_n   \label{eqfnsemilocal}\end{aligned}\ ] ]    @xmath54 \rho_n   \label{eqrhosemilocal}\end{aligned}\ ] ]    where there is no summation on repeated indices and all sums are for @xmath55 unless indicated otherwise . for the abelian - gauge fields , we have @xmath56 finally , for the non - abelian fields  : @xmath57    in order to obtain localized solutions , appropriate boundary conditions should be imposed . the boundary conditions will guarantee that the solutions will be regular on the axis @xmath58 and approach a vacuum for @xmath59 . regularity at @xmath58 yields @xmath60 while the requirement for asymptotic approach to the vacuum is somewhat more involved . for the scalar field we simply have @xmath61 which makes a clear distinction between the @xmath62 fields @xmath63 and the @xmath64 field . this last one will either trivially vanish , or have a unique behavior of starting at a non - vanishing central value and decreasing monotonically to zero . therefore , to avoid singularity at @xmath58 all the solutions discussed in the following will have @xmath65 . for the asymptotic behavior of the gauge fields we start by the observation that under a lorentz boost in the @xmath48 direction , the quantities @xmath66 transform as lorentz two - vectors . since we will consider in this paper only the case when these two vectors are spacelike ( corresponding to the magnetic case in the classification of @xcite ) , we can choose _ one _ of these two - vectors to be of the form @xmath67 without loosing generality . independently , one can perform residual gauge transformations of the form @xmath68 and assume in the following @xmath69 as for the azimuthal components of the gauge fields we have to impose @xmath70 these are @xmath62 equations for the two unknowns @xmath71 and @xmath72 , so the three magnetic numbers @xmath73 can not be independent . moreover , since they must be integers , not every @xmath38 in the cartan subalgebra is possible . a closed formula for these relations is rather complicated so we demonstrate this by two examples for the case @xmath74 where we can parametrize @xmath38 by : @xmath75 where @xmath76 are gell - mann matrices . for @xmath77 we have the relation @xmath78 and @xmath79 , while for @xmath80 we have @xmath81 and accordingly @xmath82 . @xmath71 however is given always by @xmath83 . the concrete solutions which we will present will be mainly with @xmath74 ( other values of @xmath62 can be treated similarly ) .      in this section , we express several quantities which characterize the different types of solutions . the quantities are presented for string solutions of the extended non - abelian higgs model . the corresponding formulas for the `` non extended '' model ( i.e. @xmath84 ) are obtained by setting @xmath85 and @xmath86 in eq . ( [ semilocalansatz ] ) and those that follow . the energy and angular momentum ( per unit length ) of the solutions are obtained by computing the integrals @xmath87 the energy densities @xmath88 , correspond respectively to the scalar part , the gauge field part and the potential . they are given by @xmath89 \\ \nonumber + \rho_n'^2 + \left ( \frac{(n - a_\theta - \tilde{a}_\theta g_{n})^2}{x^2}+ ( \varpi - a_0 - \tilde{a}_0 g_{n})^2 + ( q - a_z - \tilde{a}_z g_{n})^2 \right)\rho_n^2 \nonumber \label{energydensity0}\end{aligned}\ ] ] @xmath90 @xmath91\end{aligned}\ ] ] the angular momentum density @xmath92 has the form @xmath93    the solutions are also characterized by the noether charges and currents associated with the global @xmath94 symmetry of the lagrangian . the charges ( per unit length ) are the integrals of the time components of the current densities @xmath95 where @xmath96 denotes any of the generators of the global symmetry and the summation convention is used for both the local and global indices . for the `` diagonal '' ansatz , eq . ( [ semilocalansatz ] ) , we get the following expressions for the global charge densities @xmath97 where we denote by @xmath98 the diagonal elements of the commuting flavor generators as we do for local symmetry . similarly for the current densities : @xmath99 accordingly , the charges and currents will be @xmath100 where the `` single field contributions '' @xmath101 and @xmath102 are defined in an obvious way . in terms of these , the angular momentum @xmath103 of the string can be written as @xmath104 . since the non - abelian charges all vanish due to the boundary conditions , these `` single field contributions '' are not independent but satisfy the following identities among the charges and currents @xmath105 these identities allow one to express two of the currents ( or charges ) in terms of the others . as a consequence , for an @xmath94 global symmetry , the @xmath62 diagonal global currents can be expressed in terms of @xmath106 independent ones . for example , for local @xmath7 and global @xmath40 , these relations lead to @xmath107 ; therefore @xmath108 by the left equation of ( [ sumchargesandcurrents ] ) and the two diagonal global currents are proportional to @xmath109 .    for local @xmath40 and the choice @xmath77 , the global @xmath110 currents depend on two of the `` single field '' currents @xmath102 say , @xmath111 and @xmath112 . actually two of them are just proportional to @xmath111 and @xmath112 and the third is a combination : @xmath113 these identities provide useful crosschecks of the numerical solutions discussed next . we solved the system of non - linear equations ( [ eqscalarsemilocal])-([ymeqssemilocal ] ) by using a numerical routine based on the collocation method @xcite . the solutions were constructed with grids involving typically 1000 points and with accuracy of the order of @xmath114 . the solutions we found are described in the following .      before discussing the semilocal strings , we pause to describe the simplest kind of non - abelian ones , namely the _ local _ non - abelian strings . they are obtained by truncating the general system to the case with @xmath115 so @xmath85 and @xmath86 . this requires the further substitutions @xmath116 in the field equations above . = 10.0 cm +    inspection of the boundary conditions for the gauge fields as @xmath117 , reveals that in the gauge choice ( [ gaugeres ] ) all the parameters @xmath118 should vanish , leading to @xmath119 . so we solve equations ( [ eqscalarsemilocal])-([ymeqssemilocal ] ) with the above substitutions and with the following boundary conditions : @xmath120 the only stringlike solutions in this system are of the magnetic type , labelled by the integers @xmath73 which are consistent with the value we pick for the angle @xmath121 in the 3 - 8 plane of the cartan subalgebra .    in fig . [ fig1 ] we show the field profiles of a typical @xmath40 local string solutions with @xmath77 . the abelian flux is still quantized but is not an integer as can be easily seen from the figure . its value is 3/2 . similarly , the non - abelian flux is @xmath122 . now we return to the general case of the full system with @xmath123 , that is equations ( [ eqscalarsemilocal])-([ymeqssemilocal ] ) with non - vanishing @xmath124 and @xmath125 . the solutions have in general @xmath126 while we can still exploit the remaining symmetry to require again @xmath127 for @xmath128 . in contrast with the local case , the equations for the fields @xmath129 , @xmath130 , @xmath131 and @xmath132 are not trivially satisfied if @xmath133 and we have now non - trivial boundary conditions for these gauge components . the boundary conditions are contained in equations ( [ bczero ] ) , ( [ bcscalarinf ] ) , ( [ gaugeres ] ) and ( [ bcthetainf ] ) and we will not repeat them here . we just point out that the scalar and gauge fields reach their asymptotic values with exponential corrections . in particular , the field @xmath64 decays according to @xmath134}$ ] , which explains why this field can decay slower than the others for @xmath135 . we have therefore to solve for @xmath136 , @xmath137 , @xmath138 , @xmath139 and @xmath140 in addition to the @xmath62 scalar components and the two gauge components @xmath141 and @xmath142 .    along with @xcite , we call solutions of this type `` twisted '' solutions . the parameter @xmath143 will be referred to as the `` twist '' parameter . the solutions will be generally `` twisted '' , but special `` untwisted '' solutions ( with @xmath144 ) also occur . we also distinguish between static solutions with @xmath145 and stationary for @xmath146 . their properties will be studied below . the simplest kind of semilocal solutions is the _ embedded _ ( non - abelian ) local flux tubes . these are purely magnetic solutions of the full system with @xmath85 . it is therefore evident that @xmath147 and the non - vanishing fields , the @xmath62 scalars @xmath63 , and the two gauge components @xmath141 and @xmath142 , are the same as for the local strings of sec . [ seclocalstrings ] . another kind of purely magnetic strings is the _ untwisted _ semilocal strings which generalize the `` skyrmion '' solutions of the abelian model mentioned in sec . [ secextnah ] . these solutions are only self - dual as in the abelian case , and are contained already among the results of earlier studies @xcite . in our parametrization they exist for @xmath148 . the more general kinds of solutions which contain `` twists '' @xcite will be discussed in the next sections . the space of twisted semilocal strings decomposes into three regions which are labelled according to the sign of the norm of the two - vector @xmath149 , that is according to the sign of @xmath150 . in the `` timelike '' region ( @xmath151 ) we were unable to find localized solutions as happens also in the abelian case @xcite ( recall also the asymptotic behavior mentioned above ) , so we do not discuss them further . solutions with @xmath152 are known as `` chiral '' and will be discussed below among the stationary solutions . if we assume the two - vector @xmath149 to be spacelike , we can set @xmath153 by an appropriate lorentz boost . the field equations for @xmath129 and @xmath131 are satisfied trivially by @xmath154 and all the charges @xmath155 vanish with this choice . the components @xmath130 and @xmath132 as well as the currents @xmath156 do not vanish .    [ ! b ]   , title=""fig : "" ]   , title=""fig : "" ] +    = 10.0 cm +    in the abelian case ( @xmath28 and @xmath157 with irrelevant @xmath23 ) @xcite twisted semilocal strings appear for large enough values of the potential coupling constant @xmath22 ( precisely for @xmath35 in our notations ) . they form continuous family of static solutions and are labelled by the `` twist parameter '' @xmath143 appearing in the phase of the scalar function @xmath158 ; this parameter takes values in a finite interval , that is @xmath159 $ ] where @xmath160 is the maximal twist where bifurcation with the embedded flux tube occurs . this value of @xmath160 depends on the coupling constant @xmath22 . in the limit @xmath161 the function @xmath158 converges uniformly to the null function and the branch of twisted solutions bifurcates into the local string solutions .    here , we consider the extended non - abelian higgs model with our potential ( [ pot1 ] ) and find that analogous string solutions exists when the potential parameters , @xmath162 , are chosen large enough . a similar critical phenomenon occurs , and in addition to the critical twist there exists now a critical @xmath163 . first , we study the case of an @xmath7 gauge group and a global @xmath40 . we find twisted semilocal strings corresponding to different choices of the magnetic parameters @xmath164 . [ figsstatictwsu2 ] shows the field profiles of two typical static twisted semilocal strings with different windings and therefore different fluxes . note the additional scalar field @xmath158 which decreases slowly , yet still exponentially . the relations among the currents , eq . ( [ sumchargesandcurrents ] ) yield in this case @xmath107 ( see explanation below ( [ sumchargesandcurrents ] ) ) and we observe that it is consistent with the numerical results giving @xmath165 for this case as is indeed seen in fig .

[ fig6 ] depicts a typical solution corresponding to the specific cartan generator fixed by @xmath77 . the magnetic fields along the string axis ( abelian and non abelian ) and the energy density of a twisted solution ( with @xmath168 or @xmath169 ) are compared in fig . [ fig12 ] with those of an embedded local string . note that the twisted strings have a non - vanishing tangential magnetic field ( @xmath170see figure [ magneticfield ] ) whose contribution to the flux vanishes . t ] = 10.0 cm   , title=""fig : "" ]   , title=""fig : "" ] +    the solutions constructed above are static but they can be made stationary by applying a boost along the string axis ( @xmath48 ) . alternatively , stationary solutions can be obtained directly by setting the parameter @xmath171 non zero in the field equations . interestingly , allowing the parameter @xmath172 confers the strings with angular momentum as was first demonstrated in the abelian case @xcite . the resulting angular momentum is therefore more like the `` orbital '' kind rather than an intrinsic spin - like . the profiles of twisted solutions corresponding to @xmath173 and @xmath174 are presented in fig . [ fig7 ] for @xmath153 and @xmath175 ( i.e. very close to the chiral limit @xmath176 ) . we note that the chiral limit @xmath177 leads to a different kind of solutions with @xmath178 decaying as a power instead of exponentially . this tendency is apparent in fig . [ fig7 ] namely , through the decay of the function @xmath178 . = 10.0 cm +      since we know from the abelian case ( @xmath28 ) that twisted semilocal strings exist only is a restricted domain of the parameter space , it is natural to try to figure out this domain in the present non - abelian model . the lagrangian ( [ lag ] ) is characterized by four parameters : @xmath22 , @xmath23 of the scalar potential and two gauge coupling constants @xmath179 and @xmath180 . however , only the relative strength @xmath181 appears in the field equations so the parameter space of the model is three - dimensional . = 10.0 cm +    = 10.0 cm +    the parameter space of the _ solutions _ is far more complicated since it contains also the twist @xmath143 , the other phase parameter @xmath171 and the flux numbers . we investigated this problem in the case of an @xmath40 gauge group and we present here the main results in various planes in this higher dimensional parameter space . we took representative values of @xmath182 for which it turns out that twisted semilocal strings exist . the effect of changing the parameter @xmath163 on the twisted solutions is illustrated in fig . [ fig9 ] where the critical @xmath160-value is plotted as a function of @xmath183 for two different choices of @xmath184 . the choice @xmath185 corresponds to @xmath77 and the choice @xmath186 to @xmath80 as explained at the end of sec . [ secfeqs ] . the twisted semilocal strings exist only for @xmath187 and for values of @xmath183 below a maximal value of @xmath188 . this value depends on @xmath189 and determines a domain of existence of twisted solutions in the @xmath190 plane .    in fig . [ fig10 ] , a few physical quantities characterizing the solutions corresponding to @xmath191 are presented . we find @xmath192 which is consistent with the value that is obtained from fig . we further studied the critical phenomenon appearing when the maximal value of @xmath163 ( with @xmath143 fixed ) is reached as seen in fig . [ fig10 ] . our numerical results suggest in particular that the twisted solution bifurcates into the embedded local string at @xmath193 . note especially the vanishing of @xmath194 , @xmath195 and @xmath196 as @xmath197 . the evolution of the physical parameters characterizing the twisted solutions for @xmath198 is further presented in fig . [ fig11 ] as a function of the twist parameter @xmath143 . we see from the plot that the solution bifurcates into the embedded local string for @xmath199 which is of course consistent with @xmath200 of fig . we notice that the central value of the non abelian magnetic field , @xmath201 changes sign between the bifurcation point and the low twist region ( i.e. @xmath202 ) . = 10.0 cm +    the effect of a boost along the string axis , which is reflected by a non - vanishing @xmath171 , on some physical quantities is presented in fig . [ fig8 ] . in this figure @xmath203 and @xmath201 are plotted versus @xmath171 for a fixed value of @xmath143 ( for instance @xmath174 ) and for the two values @xmath204 which require different sets of @xmath73 as explained above . we stress that the plots are made for fixed @xmath143 , so the solutions involved are not related to each other by boosts along the @xmath48 direction . in particular , the magnetic fields on the @xmath48-axis vary with @xmath171 . note also that the chiral limit has nontrivial consequences on the mass and spin of the solutions ( per unit length ) which diverge in this limit as indicated in fig . this work presents string solutions in the extended non - abelian higgs model which may be seen as an expansion of recent discussions of abelian twisted semilocal strings @xcite and of non - abelian untwisted ones @xcite . the solutions are classified according to the twist parameter @xmath143 as twisted or untwisted ( for @xmath144 ) . the twisted solutions are characterized by a persistent current along the string axis . the twisted solutions are further classified as static ( @xmath153 ) or stationary , where the latter are also characterized by a non - zero angular momentum . the extended non - abelian higgs model allows also two kinds of special solutions  both untwisted and both purely magnetic : the embedded local non - abelian flux tubes and the self - dual `` skyrmions '' . the occurence of twisted semilocal string and their corresponding conserved currents is closely connected to the existence of a scalar field which condensates on the axis and vanishes asymptotically . for @xmath205 all scalars are higgs - like fields which acquire asymptotically a non vanishing expectation value due to the potential . as a consequence , there is no place for a condensate and no twisted semilocal string are possible in this case . all those solutions were constructed by numerically solving the field equations with the appropriate boundary conditions . the solutions exist only on a non trivial domain of the parameter space of the possible solutions . we have tried to determine this domain qualitatively and obtained a lot of information about the pattern of the solutions . we demonstrated the bifurcation phenomenon which occurs in this case at a critical value of the twist @xmath143 which now depends on the various fluxes and on @xmath206 in addition to the parameters in the potential .    a crucial step for deciding the physical relevance of non - abelian twisted semilocal strings would be to study their stability by performing a systematic normal mode analysis , as was done recently @xcite for the extended abelian higgs model . another important issue is the understanding of the low - energy dynamics of the non - abelian twisted semilocal strings . this can be done e.g. by using the geodesic approximation of @xcite which is based on a parametrization of the zero modes in terms of collective coordinates . for untwisted local and semilocal strings , this analysis is reported in details by aldrovandi ( see sec . vi of @xcite ) . since the phases of twisted semilocal strings depend on @xmath46 and @xmath48 , the parametrization of the orientational moduli in terms of slowly varying functions of these coordinates does not seem to be straightforward . the parametrization of the fluctuations used in @xcite might turn out to be very useful . we plan to address these questions in a further publication , as well as the gravitating counterparts of twisted strings . another direction is motivated by the non -

"modes of fundamental significance to nonlinear optics  @xcite and plasmonics  plas1,plas3,plas4,plas5,plas6,plas7,plas8,plas9,marini , korea are dissipative spatial solitons that result from the simultaneous balance among diffraction , self - focusing nonlinearity , loss , and compensating gain . stability is a crucially important issue in the theoretical analysis of dissipative solitons . an obvious necessary condition for the stability of localized modes is the stability of the zero background around them . the basic complex ginzburg - landau ( cgl ) equation , which includes the bandwidth - limited linear gain and nonlinear loss acting on a single field , is unable to produce stable dissipative solitons , since the action of the linear gain on the zero background makes it unstable . on the other hand , dissipative solitons can be fully stabilized in systems of linearly coupled cgl equations  @xcite modeling dual - core waveguides , with the linear gain and loss acting in different cores  marini , dual1,dual2,dual3,dual4,dual5 , including the @xmath0-symmetric version of the system that features the balance between the gain and loss  @xcite . stable solitons can also be generated by a single cgl equation with cubic gain sandwiched "" between linear and quintic losses , which may be realized in optics as a combination of linear amplification and power - dependent absorption  cq1,cq2,cq3,cq4,cq5,cq6,cqgle1,cqgle2,cqgle3,cqgle4,cqgle5 . another method for creating stable localized modes makes use of linear gain applied at a hot spot "" ( hs , i.e. a localized amplifying region embedded into an ordinary lossy waveguide  @xcite or a bragg grating  @xcite ) . models with multiple hss  spotsexact1,spots1,spots2,spots3,spotsexact2 , and similar extended amplifying structures  @xcite , have been studied as well . hss can be built by implanting gain - producing dopants into a narrow segment of the waveguide  @xcite , or , alternatively , by focusing an external pump beam at the designated position of the hs in a uniformly - doped waveguide . in addition to models with the localized direct ( phase - insensitive ) gain , systems including the localization of parametric gain was developed as well  @xcite . dissipative solitons can be stably pinned to the hs due to the balance between the local gain and uniform loss in the bulk waveguide . for narrow hss modeled by the delta - functional distribution of the gain , solutions for the pinned dissipative solitons are available in analytical form  hsexact , spotsexact1,spotsexact2 . furthermore , models with mutually balanced gain and loss applied in the form of @xmath1-functions at separated points @xcite , or at a single location , in the form of a gain - loss dipole described by the derivative of the @xmath1-function thawatchai , make it possible to find solution for @xmath0-symmetric solitons pinned to these points . other one- and two - dimensional ( 1d and 2d ) hs - pinned modes , including stable vortices fed by the gain confined to an annular - shaped area  @xcite , can be found numerically  @xcite .    while dissipative solitons in uniform media are always unstable against the blowup in the absence of the higher - order ( quintic ) nonlinear losses  kramer , ml , it is worthy to note a counter - intuitive result @xcite demonstrating that _ stable _ dissipative localized modes in uniform linearly - lossy media may be supported by _ unsaturated _ localized cubic gain alone . stable dissipative solitons were also predicted in a setting that combines the uniformly - distributed linear gain in the @xmath2-dimensional space and nonlinear loss growing from the center to periphery faster than @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the radial coordinate  @xcite . the class of models with the localized gain includes lattice systems . in ref . @xcite , the 1d model was introduced for a linear lossy lattice with a single or two amplified ( active ) sites embedded into it , which represent the hss in the discrete setting . it was assumed that the nonlinearity was carried solely by the same active sites . this system , which may be considered as a variety of discrete cgl equations discrcgl1,discrcgl2,discrcgl3,discrcgl4,discrcgl5,discrcgl6,discrcgl7,discrcgl8,discrcgl9,discrcgl10,discrcgl11 , can be implemented in the experiment using arrays of optical waveguides @xcite or arrayed plasmonic waveguides  plasmon - array1,plasmon - array2,plasmon - array3 . in particular , it suggests possibilities for selective excitation of particular core(s ) in the arrayed waveguides , if the system is uniformly doped , but only the selected cores are pumped by an external laser beam . in ref . @xcite , discrete solitons pinned to the hs in the lattice system were found in an analytical form , similar to the soliton solutions available in the discrete linear schrdinger equation with embedded nonlinear elements  @xcite , and the stability of the localized models was investigated by means of numerical methods . the present work aims to extend the analysis for the 2d lattice system , with one or two active nonlinear sites  embedded into the linear lossy bulk lattice . the experimental realization of such a 2d medium is also possible in nonlinear optics , using waveguiding arrays permanently written in bulk silica  @xcite . an essential distinction from the 1d counterpart  @xcite mentioned above is that 2d localized lattice modes can not be found analytically , even if only a single nonlinear site is embedded into the linear matrix . nevertheless , we demonstrate that semi - analytical solutions can be obtained for truncated ( finite - size ) lattices . the paper is organized as follows . the discrete 2d cgl equation is introduced in sec .  [ sec : gov ] . section  [ sec : trun ] presents semi - analytical results for the truncated lattices . results of the linear - stability analysis for the hs - pinned lattice solitons against small perturbations are reported in sec . [ sec : stab ] . in sec . [ sec : onset ] we extend the stability analysis , considering the crucially important issue of the onset of the zero - solution instability . a brief consideration of the double - hs system is presented in sec . [ sec : dual ] . the paper is concluded by sec . [ sec : con ] . as said above , we consider the 2d generalization of the 1d  lattice model introduced in ref . @xcite : @xmath5 \delta _ { m,0}\delta _ { n,0}u_{m , n}\ ; , \label{eq : gl}\end{gathered}\]]where @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , ... are discrete coordinates on the lattice , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the kronecker s symbols , and the coefficient of the linear coupling between adjacent cores is scaled to unity . further , @xmath11 is the linear loss in the bulk lattice , @xmath12 and @xmath13 account for the linear gain and linear potential applied at the hs site ( @xmath14 ) , while @xmath15 and @xmath16 account for the kerr nonlinearity and nonlinear loss / gain ( for @xmath17 ) acting at the hs .    in optics , the 2d discrete equation , as well as its 1d counterpart , can be derived by means of well - known methods chr , discrcgl1,discrcgl2,discrcgl3,discrcgl4,discrcgl5,discrcgl6,discrcgl7,discrcgl8,discrcgl9,discrcgl10,discrcgl11,review . in the application to 2d arrays of plasmonic waveguides , which can be built as a set of metallic nanowires embedded into a bulk dielectric plasmon - array1,plasmon - array2,plasmon - array3 , eq . ( [ eq : gl ] ) can be derived in the adiabatic approximation , with the exciton field eliminated in favor of the photonic one . it is relevant to mention that the well - known _ staggering transformation _ @xcite , @xmath18 , where the asterisk stands for the complex conjugate , simultaneously reverses the signs of @xmath13 and @xmath15 , thus rendering the self - focusing and defocusing signs of the nonlinearity , which correspond to @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively , mutually convertible . this circumstance is essential , in particular , for modeling arrays of plasmonic waveguides , where the intrinsic excitonic nonlinearity is always self - repulsive . below , we fix the signs of @xmath13 and @xmath15 by setting @xmath21 , i.e. the corresponding linear potential at the hs is _ attractive _ , while @xmath15 may be positive ( self - focusing ) , negative ( self - defocusing ) , or zero . unless @xmath22 , this coefficient is normalized to be @xmath23 . these two cases are considered separately below , along with the case of @xmath22 , when the nonlinearity is represented solely by the cubic dissipation localized at the hs . we seek solutions to eq . ( [ eq : gl ] ) for stationary localized modes with real propagation constant @xmath24 as @xmath25outside of the hs site , @xmath14 , eq . ( [ eq : gl ] ) gives rise to the linear stationary equation,@xmath26which , unlike its 1d counterpart ( cf . @xcite ) , does not admit exact analytical solutions . an approximate solution can be constructed on a truncated lattice . the simplest version of the truncation is shown in fig . [ sketch ] , where four independent amplitudes obeying eq . ( [ u ] ) are defined : @xmath27 ( at the center ) , @xmath28 ( in the first rhombic layer surrounding the center ) , and @xmath29 ( two independent amplitudes in the second rhombic layer ) . the amplitudes in all other layers are neglected : @xmath30 . at @xmath31 , the so truncated eq . ( [ u ] ) yields : @xmath32where central amplitude @xmath27 is defined to be real , and the complex coefficient is @xmath33    the remaining nonlinear equation ( [ eq : gl ] ) at the hs site , @xmath14 , reduces to a complex equation relating real peak intensity @xmath34 and propagation constant @xmath24:@xmath35which can be solved numerically . subsequently , the amplitudes in the surrounding layers are obtained from eq . ( [ 3210 ] ) . the accuracy of the truncated - lattice analysis can be improved by including more rhombic layers in the calculation . although the respective version of eqs . ( [ 3210 ] ) and  ( [ 0 ] ) become more complicated , they are still easy to solve numerically . table  [ tab1 ] shows numerically found @xmath27 and @xmath36 for the different truncation settings at two different sets of parameters . naturally , convergence of the solutions for the localized modes is observed with the increase of the number of the rhombic layers . .numerical solutions for different versions of the truncated lattice at @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 . [ cols=""^,^,^,^,^ "" , ] we have introduced the 2d discrete dynamical system based on the bulk linear lossy lattice , into which one or two nonlinear sites with the linear gain ( hss , hot spots "" ) are embedded . the system can be implemented in the form of an array of optical or plasmonic waveguides , admitting , in particular , selective excitation of individual cores , by the local application of the external pump to the uniformly doped array . the analysis of localized modes pinned to the hss was developed both semi - analytically ( using truncated lattices ) and numerically . it has been found that , in the case of the self - focusing nonlinearity at the single hs , the pinned modes are stable ( unstable ) when the nonlinearity acting at the hs contains the cubic loss ( gain ) . on the other hand , it is worthwhile to note that , in the case of the self - defocusing nonlinearity , the hs with an unsaturated cubic gain supports stable modes , in a rather small parameter region , and bistability occurs in the case of weak cubic loss . symmetric and antisymmetric modes pinned to dual hss were also discussed briefly .    a challenging issue for the subsequent analysis is the possibility of the existence of asymmetric modes supported by the symmetric dual hss . on the other hand , a natural extension maybe to embed one or two hss into a nonlinear lossy lattice . partial financial supported has been provided by the hong kong research grants council through general research fund contract hku 711713e . abdullaev , f. k. , konotop , v. v. , salerno , m. , & yulin , a. v. 2010 dissipative periodic waves , solitons , and breathers of the nonlinear schrdinger equation with complex potentials . e _ 82 , 056606 . skarka , v. , aleksi , n. b. , leblond , h. , malomed , b. a. , & mihalache , d. 2010 varieties of stable vortical solitons in ginzburg - landau media with radially inhomogeneous losses . _ 105 , 213901 . mohamadou , a. , jiotsa , a. k. , & kofane , t. c. 2005 modulational instability and unstable patterns in the discrete complex cubic ginzburg - landau equation with first and second neighbor couplings . e _ 72 , 036220 . karachalios , n. i. , nistazakis , h. e. , and yannacopoulos , a. n. 2007 asymptotic behavior of solutions of complex discrete evolution equations : the discrete ginzburg - landau equation . _ discrete . _ 19 , 711 - 736 . christ , a. , tikhodeev , s. g. , gippius , n. a. , kuhl , j. , & giessen , h. 2003 waveguide - plasmon polaritons : strong coupling of photonic and electronic resonances in a metallic photonic crystal slab . _ 91 , 183901 . christ , a. , zentgraf , t. , kuhl , j. , tikhodeev , s. g. , gippius , n. a. , & giessen , h. 2004 optical properties of planar metallic photonic crystal structures : experiment and theory . _ phys . b _ 70 , 125113 . bian , y. s. , zheng , z. , zhao , x. , su , y. l. , liu , l. , liu , j. s. , zhu , j. s. , & zhou , t. 2012 guiding of long - range hybrid plasmon polariton in a coupled nanowire array at deep - subwavelength scale . _ ieee phot . _ 24 , 1279 - 1281 . szameit , a. , burghoff , j. , pertsch , t. , nolte , s. , tnnermann , a. , & lederer , f. 2006 two - dimensional soliton in cubic fs laser written waveguide arrays in fused silica . _ optics express _ 14 , 6055 - 6062 . minardi , s. , eilenberger , f. , kartashov , y. v. , szameit , a. , rpke , u. , kobelke , j. , schuster , k. , bartelt , h. , nolte , s. , torner , l. , lederer , f. , tnnermann , a. , & pertsch , t. 2010 three - dimensional light bullets in arrays of waveguides . _ 105 , 263901 .","The text discusses the concept of dissipative solitons, which are stable, localized modes of light that can be found in various types of optical systems, including waveguides and plasmonic waveguides.

"two - dimensional ( 2d ) systems play a central role in contemporary condensed matter physics . novel phenomena such as the quantum hall effect @xcite observed when a 2d electron gas at low temperature is subjected to a strong magnetic field , as well as practical developments based on quasi-2d systems , e.g. , high - mobility field - effect transistors @xcite or semiconductor quantum - well lasers @xcite have brought significant technological advances . such devices are based on the quasiequilibrium response of the internal electron or electron - hole plasmas to an external stimulation . hence it is essential to understand the fundamental quantum - statistical properties of such two - dimensional interacting plasmas at finite temperatures . one of the well - known differences between 2d and 3d nonrelativistic quantum mechanics is the presence of at least one bound state for any symmetric attractive potential in two dimensions . this bound state , with binding energy @xmath0 , brings a non - vanishing contribution of @xmath1 to the two - body part of the partition function even if the interaction is weak and the state is very shallow . for a dilute gas this contribution introduces a deviation from the ideal gas law that is larger than the correction due to the fermi or bose statistics of the particles . however , it is clear that 2d gases with a vanishing inter - particle interaction strength should be well described by free fermi or bose gas models . this contradiction will be resolved in the present paper . a related question is what happens to the partition function when additional bound states appear with increasing strength of interaction between the particles . in the 3d case the answer to this question is based on a careful consideration of states in the continuum , which are modified by the interaction , i.e. , taking scattering into account in the partition function calculation @xcite . the same approach should be applied in two dimensions , however , scattering theory in two dimensions is relatively undeveloped compared to the 3d case . for example , the relation between low - energy scattering and bound states , which has important consequences in the statistical mechanics , has been considered only very recently @xcite in two dimensions . in the present paper the connection between scattering and the statistical mechanics of a 2d plasma is studied .    in the next section we introduce the relation of the two - dimensional scattering phase shift to the partition function and show that a proper consideration of the scattering states removes discontinuities in the partition function in an analogous fashion to the 3d case . in sects . [ short - range ] and [ ehplasma ] we explore this in more detail using an analytical model with an attractive square well potential before turning to a more realistic model of the statically screened electron - hole plasma , which is the main focus of this paper . we also compare in both cases the influence on the second virial coefficient of the exchange interaction and the screened direct interaction . such considerations are crucial in understanding the nature of the strongly correlated electron - hole plasma in semiconductor quantum wells . the two - body interaction part of the partition function of 2d interacting boltzmann particles is given by @xmath2 where @xmath3,@xmath4 is the reduced mass , @xmath5 is the projection of the angular momentum onto the axis normal to the plane of 2d motion ( @xmath6 ) , @xmath7 is the 2d scattering phase shift @xcite dependent on the relative - motion momentum @xmath8 , @xmath9 are the bound - state energies ( index @xmath10 enumerates bound states with given @xmath11 ) , and the double sum in the first term ranges only over bound states . ( [ eq1 ] ) is the 2d analogue of the beth - uhlenbeck formula and can be derived in the same fashion as in the 3d case @xcite . often only the first term in eq . ( [ eq1 ] ) is considered when calculating an internal partition function , neglecting the phase shift term . for an attractive potential @xmath12 , as @xmath13 decreases bound state energies increase towards the continuum . as such a state reaches zero energy , a partition function that contains only the bound state sum will be discontinuous . these unphysical singularities would extend to all the thermal properties , such as pressure and specific heat . integrating by parts we can rewrite eq . ( [ eq1 ] ) as @xmath14 for nonzero temperature the integral term in the right - hand side of eq . ( [ eq2 ] ) is a smooth function of the interaction strength @xmath15 . if the phase shifts satisfy the condition : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the number of bound states with given @xmath5 , the zero - energy part of the phase shift integral in eq . ( [ eq1 ] ) exactly cancels the zero - energy part of the bound state sum , removing the discontinuity in @xmath18 as a function of the interaction strength . this cancellation is similar to the well known behaviour in 3d where the partition function discontinuities are removed @xcite with the help of levinson s theorem @xcite . equation ( [ eq3 ] ) constitutes the 2d statement of levinson s theorem .    as a central theorem of scattering theory @xcite , levinson s theorem has been discussed for dirac particles , multichannel scattering , multi - particle single - channel scattering , one - dimensional scattering systems , impurities in aharonov - bohm rings , systems with non - uniform effective mass , and even for time - periodic potentials @xcite . however , its applicability to the 2d scattering problem has been considered only recently . in ref . @xcite the 2d statement of levinson s theorem , eq . ( [ eq3 ] ) , was proposed and verified empirically , while in ref . @xcite this theorem was more rigorously established for cutoff potentials using the green - function method . the above arguments , based on the partition function continuity requirement , provide an additional statistical mechanical justification of levinson s theorem in 2d . the two - body interaction part of the partition function can be used to calculate the second virial coefficient , @xmath19 , which characterizes the first correction to the ideal gas law in the low - density expansion of pressure @xmath20 @xmath21 is positive for repulsive potentials , causing an increase in the pressure over its ideal - gas value , and negative for attractive potentials , causing a decrease in the pressure . a calculation of the second virial coefficient is meaningful in the dilute gas regime , where the mean inter - particle spacing @xmath22 is larger than the thermal wavelength @xmath23 and the higher order terms in eq . ( [ eq4 ] ) are negligible . for a free , bose or fermi gas in two dimensions , @xmath24 @xcite , the plus sign applying to the fermi case , as the pauli principle introduces an effective repulsion between fermions , thereby increasing the pressure . there is extensive ongoing research in the statistical mechanics of anyons , 2d particles obeying fractional statistics @xcite , and the second virial coefficient of a free anyon gas lies in between the bosonic and fermionic value @xcite . in this paper we focus on the relative importance of interaction - induced bound and scattering states on the second virial coefficient . the 3d analysis of the second virial coefficient @xcite is easily reformulated for a 2d interacting gas @xcite . for a system of identical particles with spin @xmath25 the second virial coefficient is @xmath26 where the upper sign is for bosons and the lower sign for fermions . the exclusion principle modifies the sum over @xmath5 in eq . ( [ eq2 ] ) depending on the angular momentum parity , and the partition function ( using eq .

( [ eq7 ] ) @xmath35 and @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath18 is given by eq . ( [ eq1 ] ) or eqs . ( [ eq2 ] ) and ( [ eq3 ] ) with the properly chosen reduced mass @xmath38 . our first example , the boltzmann gas with weak short - range attraction , is chosen to elucidate how the second virial coefficient at given temperature vanishes when the binding energy @xmath39 decreases , even though the bound - state part of the internal partition function @xmath40 approaches unity rather than vanishes . to trace the precise nature of the cancellation of @xmath41 it is convenient to use eq . ( [ eq1 ] ) for @xmath18 without the application of levinson s theorem . let us assume that the 2d particles interact via an attractive square - well potential of radius @xmath42 and depth @xmath43 . this simple model allows analytical treatment which provides insight into the generic behaviour of a gas of attracting particles . to evaluate the partition function we need to analyse both the bound and scattering states in this potential . the binding energies for any value of angular momentum @xmath5 can be easily found by matching the logarithmic derivative of the radial wave function at @xmath44 : @xmath45 where @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 is the bessel function of the first kind and @xmath49 is the modified bessel function of the second kind . note that for @xmath50(i.e . smaller than the first root of @xmath51 ) there is only one bound state ( having @xmath52 ) and for @xmath53 this state is very shallow , e.g. for @xmath54 , @xmath55 , for @xmath56 , @xmath57 . for a shallow @xmath58 state the transcendental equation for binding energies eq . ( [ eq10 ] ) reduces to @xmath59 where @xmath60 ( @xmath61 is euler s constant ) .    for the unbound states with positive energy of the relative motion , @xmath62 , scattering phase shifts can be found in a similar fashion . for small values of the momentum , @xmath63 , all phase shifts for @xmath64 are small compared to @xmath65 ( @xmath25-wave scattering ) @xcite . the tangent of the @xmath25-wave scattering phase shift for @xmath66 ( i.e. @xmath67 ) is given by @xcite : @xmath68 substituting @xmath69 from eq . ( [ eq11 ] ) into eq . ( [ eq12 ] ) we get @xmath70 note that this expression does not contain parameters of the potential @xmath71 and @xmath72 explicitly , and it is valid for an arbitrary potential well with a shallow @xmath73 level @xcite .    since the integrand in the partition function , eq . ( [ eq1 ] ) , contains an exponential factor @xmath74 , the wavevectors @xmath75 which are larger than the thermal wave vector @xmath76 give negligible contribution to the value of the integral . therefore for the short - range interaction or for low temperature , satisfying condition @xmath77 , the scattering phase shifts need only be considered for @xmath78 . then all the terms in the phase shift sum in eq . ( [ eq1 ] ) can be neglected except for the term with @xmath52 . finding the derivative of @xmath65 from eq . ( [ eq13 ] ) we obtain for the two - body interaction part of the partition function @xmath79 the integral in eq . ( [ eq15 ] ) is the ramanujan integral @xcite which can be rewritten as @xcite @xmath80 where @xmath81 with @xmath82 . thus , the partition function acquires a very simple form @xmath83 a similar result has been obtained recently for contact - interacting particles @xcite .    to consider the small @xmath84 asymptotic of the function @xmath85 it is convenient to expand the integral eq . ( [ eq17 ] ) in descending powers of @xmath86 : @xmath87^{-3}\right)~. \label{eq19}\ ] ] from eq . ( [ eq19 ] ) one can see that @xmath18 and hence the second virial coefficient @xmath88 both vanish when @xmath89 , although one bound state always exists . so the lowest - order density correction to the 2d ideal gas law vanishes only slowly as @xmath90 as the binding energy is reduced . note that , when the potential supports several bound states , the contribution of any shallow bound state with @xmath58 is cancelled by the scattering phase shift integral in the `` logarithmic '' manner described above . for @xmath64 the cancellation has a power - law dependence in @xmath91 @xcite . this implies that higher - order levinson s theorems responsible for continuity of the partition function derivatives @xcite are different for @xmath58 and @xmath92 , whereas the zeroth - order levinson s theorem in two dimensions has the same form , eq . ( [ eq3 ] ) , for all @xmath11 .    for extremely weak interaction potential , such that @xmath93 , from eqs . ( [ eq11 ] ) and ( [ eq19 ] ) it follows that @xmath94 , which coincides with the perturbation theory result . in the other limit for large @xmath84 values ( @xmath95 ) , @xmath96 @xcite , therefore the exponential dependence of the partition function on the binding energy is recovered .    in fig . [ fig1 ] we plot the ratio of the total partition function @xmath97 to its bound - state part @xmath98 as a function of @xmath99 . we do this for both the full expression , eq . ( [ eq17 ] ) , and the first two terms in the asymptotic expansion , eq . ( [ eq19 ] ) . one can see that the asymptotic expression ( dashed line in fig . [ fig1 ] ) is accurate only for very small values of @xmath99 . over a wide range of @xmath91 both scattering and bound - state terms are important , e.g. when @xmath100 the scattering term produces a 20% correction to @xmath97 . when @xmath101 the bound - state contribution dominates completely . 16truecm    it is instructive to compare the contributions to the second virial coefficient of the direct and the exchange interactions . for example for a gas of spinless bosons the second virial coefficient is @xmath102 . for @xmath18 given by eq . ( [ eq18 ] ) , the direct interaction term ( @xmath103 ) is smaller than the exchange term ( @xmath104 ) for small binding energies . thus , as required for vanishing binding energy , the second virial coefficient is governed by the statistics of particles , despite the existence of a single bound state . in this section we study a more realistic model of an interacting gas than the one considered in sect . [ short - range ] . we consider a mixture of the two types of fermi particles , positively charged holes ( h ) and negatively charged electrons ( e ) . this model is important for understanding the thermodynamic and optical properties of the electron - hole plasma in semiconductor quantum wells . in the low - temperature , low - density limit most electron - hole pairs are bound into excitons . this limit has been studied extensively because of the recent proposals of exciton condensates in this system @xcite . the properties of the degenerate 2d electron - hole plasma are also well known @xcite . we consider the case when the temperature is comparable to the exciton binding energy so the occupation of continuum states ( and therefore screening ) is significant , although the carrier density is low enough to neglect the terms higher than @xmath105 in the virial expansion . the temperature and density conditions under investigation are close to those in the regime where excitonic gain in wide - gap semiconductors is anticipated @xcite . we assume for simplicity equal masses @xmath106 and spins @xmath107 for both species . then @xmath108 and the second virial coefficient for the mixture eq .  ( [ eq7 ] ) acquires the form : @xmath109 here @xmath110 and the charge neutrality condition @xmath111 is taken into account . the screened coulomb attraction between electrons and holes is modeled using the fourier representation of the interaction potential : @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the screening wave vector . hereafter we employ 3d excitonic rydberg units where length and energy are scaled , respectively , by the effective bohr radius @xmath114 and rydberg ry@xmath115 . for electron - electron and hole - hole repulsion the same potential with the opposite sign equation ( [ eq21 ] ) is the well - known thomas - fermi expression for the coulomb potential statically screened by a 2d electron gas . being the long - wavelength static limit of the random phase approximation , eq . ( [ eq21 ] ) is a simple model for the screened coulomb potential in two dimensions . nevertheless , this expression reflects the fact that the statically screened potential in two dimensions decreases at large distances slower than in the 3d case ( as a power law rather than exponentially ) . despite numerous more realistic corrections @xcite eq .  ( [ eq21 ] ) remains the most widely used approximation for the 2d screening @xcite . this potential has been known for more than three decades @xcite but some of its unusual properties were only discovered recently , e.g. the existence of a remarkably simple relation between @xmath113 and the number of bound states . namely , with decreasing screening , new bound states appear at the critical integer values of the screening length given by the simple formula@xcite @xmath116 where @xmath5 is the angular momentum and @xmath117 indicates the number of nonzero nodes of the radial wave function . equation ( [ eq22 ] ) shows that several bound states corresponding to the given value of @xmath118 appear simultaneously . this degeneracy is different from the degeneracy for the bound states of the unscreened 2d exciton ( or hydrogen atom ) , for which the states with the same value of @xmath119 are degenerate @xcite . the hidden symmetry that underlines this new degeneracy has not been fully understood yet , and eq . ( [ eq22 ] ) still lacks a rigorous analytical derivation . we also consider the low - density ( nondegenerate ) limit , when there is no pauli blocking and the self - energy correction @xcite to the beth - uhlenbeck formula can be neglected and eqs . ( [ eq2],[eq3 ] ) and eq . ( [ eq6 ] ) can be used for @xmath120 and @xmath121 respectively . the shortcomings of this model for the quantitative description of a real system of photoexcited electrons and holes in semiconductor quantum wells are self - evident ; however , it does provide a tractable model containing all the salient features of the system .    to find the second virial coefficient given by eq . ( [ eq20 ] ) one must calculate the binding energies and scattering phase shifts entering the partition functions @xmath120 and @xmath121 . we use for this purpose the 2d modification of the variable - phase method @xcite known from scattering theory . in this method the scattering phase shift and the function defining bound - state energies can be obtained as a large distance limit of the phase function , which satisfies the first - order , nonlinear riccati equation originating from the radial schrdinger equation . the variable - phase method application to scattering and bound states in the screened coulomb potential ( [ eq21 ] ) is described in detail in ref . the method is especially effective for calculation of shallow - state binding energies and low - energy scattering phase shifts . figure [ fig2 ] shows the results from the calculation of the electron - hole part of the partition function , @xmath122 , which contains both the bound state sum and the scattering phase shift integral . in this figure @xmath120 is plotted as a function of the inverse screening wave number @xmath123 . 16truecm    for the electron - hole plasma @xmath113 is a function of carrier density @xcite , and in the purely 2d case @xmath124 for low densities and is independent of density , @xmath125 for @xmath126 , in the degenerate limit . here we treat @xmath113 as a parameter characterizing the strength of the screened interaction potential eq . ( [ eq22 ] ) . to emphasize the role of scattering we show on the same plot the bound - state sum , @xmath127 , which exhibits jumps whenever new bound states appear [ i.e. when @xmath113 satisfies eq . ( [ eq22 ] ) ] . these jumps become higher with increasing screening length @xmath128 since several bound states appear simultaneously . as can be seen the additional scattering phase shift contributions completely remove these jumps . the partition function is plotted for two values of the ratio of @xmath129 to the excitonic rydberg , @xmath130 and @xmath131 , which roughly correspond to znse ( or gan ) and gaas at room temperature . one can see that for high temperature ( or low binding energy ) the bound - state contributions to @xmath120 are suppressed by the scattering phase shift integral more strongly than in the @xmath132 case .    in fig . [ fig3 ] the second virial coefficient @xmath133 ( scaled by @xmath134 ) is plotted versus the screening wave number @xmath113 for two different values of @xmath135 . 16truecm    equation ( [ eq20 ] ) is used for the calculation of @xmath136 , and the repulsion ( @xmath137 ) term partially compensates the @xmath120 term . this compensation is especially significant in the high - temperature case @xmath138 , in which the 2d electron - hole plasma behaves much like an ideal gas over a wide range of screening wave vectors . for @xmath132 the electron - hole attraction term dominates and the plasma is strongly correlated for all values of @xmath139 . in this case a small statistical repulsion ( @xmath140 , horizontal line in fig .  [ fig3 ] ) , which is due to the fermionic nature of electrons and holes , can be completely neglected . thus , at room temperature the electron - hole plasma in gaas - based quantum wells can be treated as an ideal gas , whereas in wide - gap semiconductors ( e.g. , znse or gan ) due to the high value of ry@xmath115 the 2d electron - hole plasma is strongly correlated and excitonic effects are important for its thermodynamic properties . in this paper we show that a proper account of scattering eliminates discontinuities in thermodynamic properties of the nonideal 2d gas whenever extra bound states appear with small increase of the strength of an attractive potential . this treatment provides a heuristic proof of levinson s theorem in two dimensions . we trace the way in which the bound - state contribution to the partition function of the 2d gas , with a weak short - range attraction between its particles , vanishes when the binding energy decreases . a weak @xmath90 binding energy dependence of the second virial coefficient of such a gas is found for @xmath141 . a consistent treatment of bound and scattering states in a screened coulomb potential allows us to calculate the quantum - mechanical second virial coefficient of the dilute 2d electron - hole plasma and to establish the difference between the nearly ideal electron - hole gas in gaas and the strongly correlated exciton / free - carrier plasma in wide - gap semiconductors . the 2d electron - hole plasma was considered in the low - density nondegenerate limit only . transition to the strongly degenerate fermi limit and related questions of pauli blocking and self - energy corrections to the beth - uhlenbeck formula in 2d remain the subject of further research .      also at a. f. ioffe physico - technical institute , st.petersburg , russia . , edited by r. e. prange and s. m. girvin ( springer , new york , 1990 ) . t. ando , a. b. fowler , and f. stern , rev . mod . phys . * 54 * , 437 ( 1982 ) . w. w. chow , s. w. koch , and m. sargent iii , _ semiconductor - laser physics _ ( springer , berlin , 1994 ) . a. i. larkin , zh . 38 , 1896 ( 1960 ) [ sov . jetp * 11 * , 1363 ( 1960 ) ] . f. j. rogers , h. c. graboske jr , and h. e. dewitt , phys . 34a * , 127 ( 1971 ) ; f. j. rogers , phys . rev . a * 4 * , 1145 ( 1971 ) . m. e. portnoi and i. galbraith , solid state commun . , * 103 * , 325 ( 1997 ) ; cond - mat/9705136 . lin , phys . rev . a * 56 * , 1938 ( 1997 ) . f. stern and w. e. howard , phys . rev . * 163 * , 816 ( 1967 ) . e. beth and g. e. uhlenbeck , physica ( amsterdam ) * 4 * , 915 ( 1937 ) ; see also , e.g. , l. d. landau and e. m. lifshitz , _ statistical physics _ ( pergamon , new york , 1980 ) , pt . n. levinson , k. dan . selsk . mat . . medd . * 25 * , 3 ( 1949 ) . r. g. newton , _ scattering theory of waves and particles _ ( mcgraw - hill , new york , 1966 ) . ma , phys . 76 * , 3654 ( 1996 ) ; n. poliatzky , _ ibid . _ * 76 * , 3655 ( 1996 ) ; f. vidal and j. letourneaux , phys . c * 45 * , 418 ( 1992 ) ; l. rosenberg and l. spruch , phys . a * 54 * , 4978 ( 1996 ) ; * 54 * , 4985 ( 1996 ) ; k. a. kiers and w. van dijk , j. math . phys . * 37 * , 6033 ( 1996 ) ; m. s. debianchi , _ ibid . _ * 35 * , 2719 ( 1994 ) ; v. milanovi _ et al . a * 170 * , 127 ( 1992 ) ; v. milanovi _ et al . _ , a * 25 * , l1305 ( 1992 ) ; m. diventra _ et al . _ , b * 55 * , 1353 ( 1997 ) ; p. a. martin and m. s. debianchi , europhys . lett . * 34 * , 639 ( 1996 ) , and references therein . r. l. siddon and m. schick , phys . rev . a * 9 * , 907 ( 1973 ) ; j. g. dash , _ films on solid surfaces _ ( academic , new york , 1975 ) . p. giacconi , f. matoni , and r. soldati , phys . b * 53 * , 10065 ( 1996 ) , and references therein . p. arovas , r. schrieffer , f. wilczek , and a. zee , nucl . b * 251 * , 117 ( 1985 ) . for a review on anyons see , e.g. , _ fractional statistics and anyon superconductivity _ , ed . by f. wilczek ( world scientific , singapore , 1990 ) . j. e. kilpatrick , j. chem . * 21 * , 274 ( 1953 ) ; j. e. kilpatrick , w. e. keller , e. f. hammel , and n. metropolis , phys . 94 * , 1103 ( 1954 ) . l. d. landau and e. m. lifshitz , _ quantum mechanics ( non - relativistic theory ) _ ( butterworth - heinemann , oxford , 1997 ) . m. e. portnoi , pisma zh . 14 , 1252 ( 1988 ) [ sov * 14 * , 547 ( 1988 ) ] . it is interesting to note that the expression for the scattering cross - section for resonant @xmath25-wave scattering in two dimensions , @xmath142 $ ] , despite being quite different from its 3d equivalent @xcite , nevertheless also has a pole at @xmath143 . g. h. hardy , _ ramanujan _ ( cambridge university press , cambridge , 1940 ) , p. 196 . i. s. gradshtein and i. m. ryzhik , _ tables of integrals , series , and products _ ( academic press , new york , 1994 ) . m. e. portnoi and i. galbraith , unpublished . d. boll , ann .

"pairing of electrons by exchange of spin fluctuations is a popular paradigm proposed for unconventional superconductivity including fe - based superconductors , cuprates , and heavy fermion systems . since many of these systems exhibit an ordered magnetic phase coexisting with , or in close proximity to , the superconducting phase , a small number of studies have addressed the subsidiary problem of pairing of quasi - particles in the symmetry broken spin - density - wave ( sdw ) phase . while this problem has a long history , recent experimental and theoretical developments have led a number of authors to revisit it.@xcite    for the simplest case of a doped one - band hubbard model with standard commensurate @xmath4 ordering , the existence of pairing and its consequences for the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter was initially investigated in a seminal paper by schrieffer _ et al . _ ,  @xcite where the effective pairing interaction was obtained within the random phase approximation ( rpa ) arising from longitudinal spin fluctuations in the magnetically ordered phase . these authors neglected the contribution to pairing from the transverse spin fluctuations corresponding to the goldstone mode of the spin symmetry broken state , arguing that while such modes lead to a divergent contribution to the spin susceptibility at the ordering vector @xmath5 , the coherence factors of the sdw phase screen the bare electron - electron interaction vertex , which therefore vanishes at @xmath5 . soon after , frenkel and hanke  @xcite showed that the transverse fluctuations do contribute to the pairing interaction in the same order as the longitudinal fluctuations ; the divergence of the transverse spin susceptibility is eliminated by the coherence factors , but a residual constant interaction remains .    for electron - doped cuprates , the one - band hubbard model seems to provide a reasonable minimal model since the doped electrons reside primarily on the copper sites . furthermore , calculations of band parameters for the electron - doped cuprates point to the fact that the coulomb interaction is smaller than the bandwidth ,  @xcite in contrast to their hole - doped counterparts . in consequence , the mean field treatment of the sdw order works quite well for the normal state properties of the electron - doped systems . in particular , arpes reports show a fermi surface evolution upon increased electron doping which agrees well with the band reconstruction of the one - band hubbard model due to commensurate @xmath4 order . upon electron doping , the fermi surface consists of electron pockets around @xmath6 , @xmath7 . close to critical electron doping , the emergence of hole pockets at ( or close to ) the fermi level around @xmath8 , @xmath9 may occur . @xcite    theoretically , the study of spin - fluctuation pairing for the electron - doped cuprates has been addressed mostly in the paramagnetic phase ,  @xcite where the mechanism was found to give rise to a gap with @xmath0 symmetry with strong non - monotonic features as a function of momentum as a result of fermi surface intersections with the magnetic zone boundary , the so - called hot spots . at these positions the pairing becomes particularly pronounced . this behavior was found to agree qualitatively with arpes  @xcite and raman  @xcite observations . in ref .   the possibility for a cross - over to @xmath10 symmetry was found at large dopings . in a later work , krotkov and chubukov @xcite studied the spin - mediated pairing gap close to the quantum critical point of antiferromagnetic ( af ) order and found an anisotropic @xmath0 gap symmetry , but the anisotropic behavior was not related to the hot spots , as opposed to previous work . a few studies also addressed the coexistence of superconductivity and long - range af order but treated the pairing phenomenologically , and also found a @xmath0-wave solution . @xcite    for hole - doped cuprates , stronger interactions imply that application of a weak - coupling approach to pairing is somewhat less justified . in addition , calculations of the spin wave spectrum suggest that the commensurate @xmath4 order in this case is not the ground state solution ,  @xcite complicating the theoretical modelling . spin - fluctuation - mediated pairing has , however , been extensively applied to study also hole - doped cuprates within the one - band hubbard model . first , for the paramagnetic phase scalapino _ et al . _ @xcite generalised the approach of berk and schrieffer  @xcite and found a dominant @xmath0-wave pairing instability . later , the study was extended by various methods and numerical approaches  @xcite including discussions of the possibility of other superconducting pairing symmetries arising from spin fluctuations . from a strong coupling approach , as derived from the @xmath11 model , analysis of the effective pairing at low hole doping  @xcite suggests a @xmath3-wave superconducting ground state in any coexistence phase . this is consistent with rigorous perturbative weak - coupling calculations in the presence of weak density - wave order  @xcite as well as a study of hole - doped cuprates in the coexistence phase . @xcite in addition , a recent study of spin - fluctuation mediated superconductivity in the sdw ordered metal attacked the problem by analytical rpa calculations in the large magnetization ( small pocket ) limit  @xcite and found that interactions were dominated by longitudinal fluctuations on the electron - doped side , supporting a nodeless @xmath0 gap , whereas on the hole - doped side both longitudinal and transverse fluctuations support a nodal @xmath0 gap . recently , lu _ et al . _  @xcite studied the case of underdoped cuprates in a @xmath11 like model and came to a rather different conclusion . in this paper , the coexistence of commensurate af and superconductivity was investigated in a phenomenological model where the pairing interaction arises based on nearest - neighbor magnetic exchange neglecting the double occupancy constraint . in the coexistence phase , this study found the leading superconducting instability to be triplet @xmath1-wave in the case of hole doping , providing a potential explanation for recent photoemission measurements indicating a  nodal gap "" , a state with a full gap near the usual positions of the @xmath0 gap nodes whose existence is well - established at higher dopings.@xcite it is worth noting , however , that in the original strong - coupling study of unconventional superconductivity driven by the spin waves , studied within the @xmath11 model , the @xmath0-wave symmetry of the superconducting gap was found to be the only stable solution . @xcite we also note that there exist other potential explanations of the existence of the nodeless gap in the literature . @xcite    this controversy suggests the need for a better understanding of the phase diagram of the single - band hubbard model within a single , reliable approximation scheme which can encompass paramagnetic , superconducting and coexistence phases , and which is capable of identifying the strength of pairing by both longitudinal and transverse spin fluctuations and charge fluctuations , and their relative importance for pairing across a large doping range , for different electronic structures , and for both weak and strong magnetism . therefore , we extend the work of ref .   by a more complete , fully numerical solution of the problem to both confirm the analytical calculations and extend them to the larger phase diagram . we address the question of how the pairing interactions and resulting gap symmetry in the one - band hubbard model , treated within the full spin - fluctuation approach with self - consistently determined sdw order , evolve as a function of doping throughout the phase diagram , including the coexistence dome of sdw order and superconductivity . we show that the @xmath0 solution is in fact the leading superconducting instability for all electron doping levels . in the hole - doped case , we limit ourselves to small hole doping only and force the @xmath4 order to be stable by a suppression of additional intrapocket nesting contributions to the transverse spin susceptibility . this approach also yields a coexistence phase with @xmath0 order . thus , the weak - coupling approach where pairing is mediated by spin fluctuations gives qualitatively different results than the `` strong - coupling '' approach of ref .   in the case of hole doping . we find that the sub - leading instability is a singlet @xmath2-wave solution , which shares common nodes with the @xmath0 solution along the zone diagonals , and has additional nodes along the momentum axes . in the hole - doped case where the fermi pockets are located far away from the zone axis , @xmath2 and @xmath0 become nearly degenerate . however , since the two solutions share common nodes , there is no gain in condensation energy by e.g. a time - reversal - symmetry broken solution of the form @xmath12 , and the solution of the full gap equation in fact favors @xmath0 over @xmath2 . we find further that extended @xmath13-wave is always suppressed in the coexistence phase , in agreement with the findings in ref .   for small doping levels , and on the electron - doped side we do not encounter a leading triplet gap at any moderate doping away from half - filling . the spin - fluctuation - pairing mechanism becomes strongly suppressed above the critical doping for which long - range magnetic order vanishes , since the nesting conditions are rapidly weakening as the fermi surface segments of the paramagnetic phase move apart . in a recent study of the iron - based superconductors by hinojosa _ et al . _ @xcite it was pointed out that additional interband gaps may develop in the coexistence phase due to pairing of two fermions residing on different bands . such pairs are naively expected to be negligible because they involve fermionic states far from the fermi energy and do not alone manifest a cooper instability . in this regard , these interband pairs can be considered as `` anomalous '' . however , they are non - zero in the sdw state due to a combined effect of the sdw gap and coupling to the intraband gaps ( dubbed in the following as normal gaps ) . in the iron - based system , this effect is predicted to create a different superconducting phase which explicitly breaks time - reversal symmetry by development of chiral gaps . we find from a self - consistent treatment of the coupled gap equations that the one - band hubbard model also supports substantial anomalous interband pairings . the structural factor of the anomalous gaps is @xmath0 as for the intraband gaps , but the phase structure of the intraband and interband gaps can be different . however , unlike the case of iron - based system ,  @xcite the chiral solution @xmath14 does not appear to be favored in our numerical calculations . the model is the one - band hubbard hamiltonian @xmath15 where @xmath16 creates an electron on site @xmath17 with spin @xmath18 . the interaction term @xmath19 denotes the energy cost associated with having two electrons on the same site . in reciprocal space the hamiltonian reads @xmath20 with @xmath21 - 4t'\cos(k_x)\cos(k_y)-\mu.\ ] ] the parameter @xmath22 is the energy gain corresponding to hopping between neighboring sites , and @xmath23 denotes the energy gain by hopping to next - nearest neighbor sites . the doping level of the system is controlled by changing the chemical potential @xmath24 . the interaction between two electrons is first treated in the hartree - fock approximation giving rise to af ordering of the spins . we therefore consider the mean field hamiltonian @xmath25 where @xmath26 $ ] is the af order parameter , and @xmath27 refers to summation over the reduced brillouin zone only . diagonalization of the mean field hamiltonian leads to the energy spectrum @xmath28 the magnetic gap equation is solved self - consistently given the hopping integrals @xmath29 , @xmath30 , the coulomb repulsion @xmath19 and the doping . a gapless goldstone mode at @xmath31 in the transverse spin channel is obtained automatically , since the magnetic gap equation is equivalent to the condition @xmath32 . @xcite      higher order interactions in @xmath19 generate superconductivity on top of the af order through longitudinal and transverse spin fluctuations , following the original proposals of refs .  . since @xmath19 scatters the bare electrons , the diagrammatics are performed in terms of the bare electron green s functions , but the cooper pairing takes place between the quasi - particles of the af state . the quasi - particle operators are related to the bare electron operators by the transformation : @xmath33.\end{aligned}\ ] ] transverse and longitudinal spin fluctuations give rise to fundamentally different interactions . inspection of the interaction vertex formulated in real space  @xcite shows that the charge and longitudinal interaction vertices give rise to no spin flips , whereas the transverse interaction does . in the latter channel , we have the gapless goldstone mode of the af phase which gives rise to a divergent interaction potential between the bare electrons . however , when we consider pairing between the quasi - particles of the af state , this divergence is removed by the coherence factors as noted in earlier works . @xcite in the case of pairing between opposite spin electrons , spin flip processes are possible and the effective interaction is mediated both by longitudinal and transverse spin fluctuations . if pairing occurs between same spin electrons , only longitudinal spin fluctuations contribute and the pairing potential does not include the bare coulomb repulsion @xmath19 since this acts only between opposite spin electrons . the interaction hamiltonian is formulated in terms of the sdw quasi - particles , and in line with earlier work  @xcite we show the interactions in the longitudinal and transverse channel individually , with the transverse part of the interaction stated as a spin flip vertex explicitly ,    @xmath34    with    @xmath35l^2({{\bf k}},{{\bf k}}')-[2u -

( [ eq : gammaz])-([eq : gammass ] ) the bare interaction vertices are modified by coherence factors of the sdw phase given by @xmath41 with @xmath42 and @xmath43 . the interaction hamiltonians stated in eqs . ( [ eq : hc])-([eq : hss ] ) are restricted to cooper pairing between quasi - particles residing in the same band , i.e. @xmath44 and @xmath45 . in section  [ sec : anomalouspairing ] we introduce an extended model which includes cooper pairing between fermions residing on different pockets , i.e. mean fields of the form @xmath46 . for now we restrict ourselves to normal intraband cooper pairs and include pair scattering interactions within each band as well as between the bands . the expression for the interband couplings between pairs of @xmath47 with @xmath48 residing on the @xmath49 band and @xmath50 on the @xmath51 band , which are dubbed @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 are obtained by interchanging the coherence factors @xmath55 and @xmath56 in the eqs . ( [ eq : gammaz])-([eq : gammass ] ) in agreement with refs .  . the presence of magnetic order breaks spin - rotational symmetry , but inversion symmetry is preserved . this allows us to express the superconducting gap in an even and odd parity form which corresponds to a quasi - spin singlet and a quasi - spin triplet gap , respectively . we label the gaps by the superscript `` s '' for even parity ( singlet ) and superscript `` t '' for the odd parity ( triplet ) gap , i.e. @xmath57 . as we show later when discussing the interband ( anomalous ) pairing terms , it is more useful to classify the superconducting gaps in the sdw background by parity rather than by spin quantum numbers . in this regard calling cooper pairing spin singlet or spin triplet in the sdw background actually refers to the even or odd parity of the wave function , respectively .    in the derivation of the superconducting gap equations the splitting of these two channels leads to the symmetrization / antisymmetrization of the pairing potential in the quasi - spin singlet / triplet gap equation @xmath58\nonumber,\\ \label{eq : scgapequation}\end{aligned}\ ] ] and similarly for @xmath59 by interchanging @xmath60 . in the case of opposite spin interaction the effective pairing interactions for the singlet and triplet channel are given by @xmath61 for the intraband contributions and equivalent expressions for the interband , @xmath62 , contributions . similarly , for same spin electron interactions , the singlet and triplet potential is obtained directly by a symmetrization / antisymmetrization of the potential stated in eq . ( [ eq : gammass ] ) . the strength of the pairings is calculated by evaluating the real part of the rpa susceptibilities at zero energy . note that due to broken spin rotation symmetry there is a difference between @xmath63 and @xmath64 . the pairing vertex @xmath65 diverges at @xmath66 due to the goldstone mode in the transverse channel . this divergence is removed , however , by the coherence factor @xmath67 of the sdw phase , as discussed above .    in the paramagnetic phase where @xmath68 , pairing takes place between the bare electrons and the gap equation then reduces to @xmath69\frac{\delta^{\rm ( s / t)}_{{{\bf k}}'}}{e^{\rm ( s / t)}_{{{\bf k}}'}}\tanh\big(\frac{e^{\rm ( s / t)}_{{{\bf k}}'}}{2k_bt}\big),\nonumber\\ \label{eq : scgapequationns}\end{aligned}\ ] ] with @xmath70 . the effective pairings are given by @xmath71\pm v_{+-}({{\bf k}}-{{\bf k}}').\nonumber\\   \label{eq : pmpot}\end{aligned}\ ] ]      in the sdw phase , the effective pairings contain umklapp terms , which are the terms in eqs . ( [ eq : gammaz])-([eq : gammass ] ) containing the argument @xmath72 . due to these terms , there are attractive pair scatterings @xmath47 on the reconstructed fermi surface . this contrasts with the situation in the paramagnetic phase , where the spin - fluctuation part of singlet potential is always purely repulsive for all pairs of @xmath47 , as seen from eq . ( [ eq : pmpot ] ) . however , despite the presence of a partially attractive potential , a conventional @xmath13-wave superconducting gap is not possible . this is due to a symmetry constraint on the pairing potentials , which must obey @xmath73 , a property that is fulfilled for both the longitudinal and transverse pairing interactions . this symmetry also carries over to the superconducting gap , which must satisfy @xmath74 for the two dimensional square lattice , the gap solutions can be classified according to the five irreducible representations of the @xmath75 group that are even under reflection through the horizontal plane , i.e. extended @xmath13-wave ( @xmath76 ) , @xmath0 , @xmath10 , @xmath2 and the triplet solution , @xmath77 , which is doubly degenerate . first we consider whether these solutions all comply with the additional symmetry constraint , eq . ( [ eq : dsym ] ) present in the sdw phase . this disqualifies the @xmath10 solution and as a result we consider the leading gap symmetries from among the set @xmath78\sin(k_x)\sin(k_y ) , \label{eq : gxy}\\ e_{u } : & ~ &     p_{x}=\sin(k_x ) , \quad   p_{y}=\sin(k_y ) \label{eq : p}.\end{aligned}\ ] ] we emphasize that these basis functions are only the lowest order functions corresponding to the given irreducible representations . in the construction of higher order solutions in the sdw phase , it is important to note that an odd number of the above basis functions must be multiplied in order for the resulting higher order gap function to comply with eq . ( [ eq : dsym ] ) . further allowed higher order solutions can also be achieved by a multiplication of the @xmath10 basis function [ @xmath79 with any @xmath80 , @xmath81 or @xmath82 basis functions . a relevant triplet solution is constructed by a multiplication of the triplet @xmath1-wave with the lowest order a@xmath83 and b@xmath83 basis functions , @xmath84[\cos(k_x)+\cos(k_y)]\sin(k_x ) , \label{eq : extf } \nonumber \\\end{aligned}\ ] ] which for tetragonal symmetry belongs to the same @xmath85 symmetry representation as the original @xmath1-wave solution . therefore , we dub this state @xmath86-wave . note that in the literature on sr@xmath87ruo@xmath88 this function is sometimes called @xmath89-wave . @xcite we find that this is the leading solution among the triplet solutions for any doping . however , as we shall see below , it does not dominate over the singlet solutions .     and ( b ) small electron doping @xmath90 for @xmath91 and @xmath92 . ]    the consequences of a @xmath0 solution are manifested very differently depending on the fermi surface geometry . in the presence of only electron pockets , as in fig . [ fig : fermisurf](b ) , it is nodeless at the fermi surface , as opposed to the other solutions , which all display nodes . if both electron and hole pockets are present at the fermi surface as in fig . [ fig : solutionslge](e ) , the @xmath0 solution has nodes only at the hole pockets , whereas the extended @xmath13-wave as well as the @xmath2-wave solutions exhibit nodes at both types of pockets . navely , we might expect the preferred solution to have the minimum number of nodes at the fermi surface . in this respect , the @xmath0 solution clearly wins , but ultimately the leading solution relies on a detailed investigation of the structure of the pairing interaction in the sdw phase and the solution to the full gap equation . finally , when only hole pockets are present at the fermi surface as shown in fig . [ fig : fermisurf](a ) , the @xmath93 solution becomes nodeless , whereas none of the singlet gap symmetries will provide nodeless superconductivity . as we show below , the @xmath93 solution is supported from the structure of the longitudinal fluctuations , but becomes overall less favorable compared to @xmath0 due to an effective repulsion arising from the transverse spin fluctuations .      in order to determine the leading and sub - leading instabilities , we linearize the full gap equation stated in eq . ( [ eq : scgapequation ] ) to obtain the eigenvalue problem @xmath94 the eigenvector of this equation @xmath95.\end{aligned}\ ] ] is a function of momentum @xmath48 . the momentum is located either on the electron pocket around @xmath6 , which we denote by @xmath49 , or on the two hole pockets , denoted by  @xmath96 , around @xmath8/@xmath9 , respectively , see fig .  [ fig : fermisurf ] . we solve the eigenvalue problem eq . ( [ eq : lge ] ) for @xmath48 and @xmath50 on these three closed pockets , which is equivalent to solving it in the whole magnetic brillouin zone . all intraband and interband interactions are included in @xmath97 : @xmath98 . \nonumber\ ] ] here , @xmath99 denotes the length of the fermi surface line segment represented by the point @xmath50 and @xmath100 is the fermi velocity at @xmath50 . the intraband ( @xmath101 ) and interband ( @xmath102 ) pairings must be expressed in the singlet and triplet symmetrized versions in accordance with eqs . ( [ eq : sympots])-([eq : sympott ] ) . the largest eigenvalue , @xmath103 , gives the leading instability since it corresponds to the largest superconducting critical temperature and the symmetry of the gap is given by the corresponding eigenvector . the linearized gap equation does not allow for a determination of complex gap solutions , which are time - reversal - symmetry - broken ( trsb ) solutions , since higher order interactions in @xmath104 are removed in the linearization process . therefore , we have additionally solved the full nonlinear gap equation as given in eq . ( [ eq : scgapequation ] ) . this allows us to compare the real solutions and trsb solutions energetically . the latter type of solutions arise naturally in situations where the pairing potential allows for two degenerate eigenfunctions of @xmath97 . therefore , they are likely to appear in the triplet channel , where all solutions to the linearized gap equation are two - fold degenerate . since the linearized equation in fact also exhibits accidentally degenerate solutions in the singlet channel upon hole doping , this opens the possibility of trsb states in this case . the prospect of observation of transitions to trsb states as a function of doping or other control parameters , potentially the first observation of this kind , has recently been the subject of considerable attention in fe - based superconductors . @xcite      so far , we have restricted the discussion to cooper pairing between quasi - particles residing on the same band , which are cooper pairs of the form @xmath44 and @xmath45 . now we introduce an extension of the model to also include anomalous pairings between fermions belonging to different pockets , i.e. @xmath46 . the complete interaction hamiltonian includes pair scattering processes between normal and anomalous gaps , as well as scatterings between anomalous gaps . anomalous pairs of the form @xmath46 involve fermions far from the fermi level , since the two bands are gapped by @xmath105 . nevertheless , the anomalous gaps become sizeable due to the coupling to the normal intraband pairs and exist only in the sdw phase since the coupling between normal and anomalous gaps are proportional to @xmath106 . a detailed analysis of the interaction hamiltonian reveals that _ even _ parity intraband gaps , i.e. @xmath107 couple to _ even _ parity anomalous interband gaps . in the iron - pnictide study of ref . the reported anomalous gap was dubbed quasi - spin triplet and coupled to an even parity singlet intraband gap . however , in that case the triplet gap is actually of even parity , which is allowed due to the band index . as a matter of fact , in the sdw background it is more useful to classify the superconducting gaps by parity rather than by spin quantum numbers , as spin - rotational symmetry is explicitly broken . thus , in our case as well as in ref . one has an even - parity normal intraband gap coupling to even - parity anomalous pairing contributions . as we shall see below , calculations of the normal intraband gaps reveal an even - parity @xmath0-wave solution . because of this , and also as a result of the structure of the interaction hamiltonian , we restrict ourselves to the even - parity channel which we label by a quasi - spin singlet index , @xmath13 . in the even - parity channel , the mean - field interaction hamiltonian takes the form    @xmath108 \nonumber\\   & & \nonumber \\   & & \hspace{.8cm}+\delta_{\alpha\beta{\uparrow}{\downarrow}}^s({{\bf k}})\alpha_{-{{\bf k}}{\downarrow}}\beta_{{{\bf k}}{\uparrow } } -\delta_{\alpha\beta{\downarrow}{\uparrow}}^s({{\bf k}})\beta_{-{{\bf k}}{\downarrow}}\alpha_{{{\bf k}}{\uparrow } } + h.c . \big],\nonumber\\ \label{eq : hmffull}\end{aligned}\ ] ]    with the mean fields @xmath109   + i\sigma_{\gamma\delta}^y\gamma^{\alpha\beta , s}_{{{\bf k}},{{\bf k } } ' } \langle \alpha_{{{\bf k } } ' \delta } ^\dagger \beta_{-{{\bf k } } ' \gamma}^\dagger +   \beta_{{{\bf k } } ' \delta } ^\dagger \alpha_{-{{\bf k } } ' \gamma}^\dagger \rangle ,   \label{eq : daa}\\   & & \nonumber\\   \delta_{\beta\beta}^s({{\bf k}})&=&-\frac{1}{8n}\sideset{}{'}\sum_{{{\bf k } } ' }    i\sigma_{\gamma\delta}^y[\gamma^{\rm s}_{{{\bf k}},{{\bf k}}'}\langle \beta_{{{\bf k } } ' \gamma}^\dagger \beta_{-{{\bf k } } ' \delta}^\dagger \rangle + \tilde\gamma^{\rm s}_{{{\bf k}},{{\bf k}}'}\langle \alpha_{{{\bf k } } ' \gamma } ^\dagger \alpha_{-{{\bf k } } ' \delta } ^\dagger   \rangle ] -

[ fig : potphasediagram ] we plot the value of the pair scattering @xmath115 for which the pairing strength is maximal for any pair of momenta @xmath47 on the fermi surface . in the low doping limit , we observe that the interaction through transverse fluctuations is much stronger for hole doping than for electron doping . for interactions in the longitudinal channel , the situation is opposite , since in this case the pairings are strongest for small electron doping compared to small hole doping .    generally , for the hole - doped system , transverse fluctuations are quantitatively stronger than the longitudinal fluctuations . for electron dopings , the longitudinal fluctuations dominate close to half filling , whereas both types of pairings contribute more equally at larger doping levels . in fact , the strength of the pairing interactions in both channels builds up towards the critical electron doping where the af order disappears . this navely suggests an increase in superconductivity close to critical electron doping . however , a closer inspection of the @xmath47 dependence of the pairing reveals that it develops a sign change for a part of the intrapocket potential and becomes strongly repulsive for nearby points at the fermi surface . this leads to an overall gap suppression despite the increased interaction strength .    . the black cross denotes the position of @xmath50 and the value of @xmath115 is shown as a function of @xmath48 around the hole pocket . negative potential contributions correspond to effective attraction . the zone diagonal is indicated by a dashed line . the filling is @xmath116 and @xmath117 , @xmath92 . note the different color scale for pairing potentials in the longitudinal and transverse channels . ]    . the black cross denotes the position of @xmath50 and the value of @xmath115 is shown as a function of @xmath48 around the electron pocket . the filling is @xmath90 and @xmath117 , @xmath92 . note the different color scale for singlet and triplet pairing potentials . ]    in general , knowledge of the @xmath47 structure of the pairing potential is crucial in order to decide what kind of superconducting instabilities are favored in the af phase . to address this question , in figs . [ fig : potbeta ] and [ fig : potalpha ] we map out both the singlet and triplet pair scattering potentials due to longitudinal and transverse spin fluctuations for hole- and electron doping , respectively . in the case of small hole doping ( fig . [ fig : potbeta ] ) , the singlet pairing interactions from longitudinal and transverse spin fluctuations are similar in structure ; there is an effective attractive ( negative ) interaction for @xmath48 and @xmath50 on the same side of the zone diagonal , whereas the interaction becomes repulsive ( positive ) when @xmath48 and @xmath50 are on opposite sides of the zone diagonal , as deduced from fig . [ fig : potbeta](a - b ) . this structure supports @xmath3-wave as well as @xmath2-wave states . in this case , the pairing interaction due to transverse spin fluctuations is much stronger than the pairing arising from longitudinal spin fluctuations , as was also deduced from fig . [ fig : potphasediagram ] , and expected from refs .  ,   and  . in the triplet channel , the effective interaction arising from the two different types of spin fluctuations has very different character . the longitudinal fluctuations in fact give rise to a locally attractive pairing on the entire pocket , as shown in fig . [ fig : potbeta](c ) . this type of pairing supports a nodeless gap of @xmath1-wave character , i.e. @xmath118 . however , due to the strong intrapocket repulsive interaction mediated by transverse spin fluctuations shown in fig . [ fig : potbeta](d ) , the total pairing interaction does not allow for a @xmath1-wave solution . @xcite therefore the triplet solution becomes higher order and will display nodes at the fermi level .    ) , ( c , d ) only electron pockets ( 5 % electron doping and @xmath91 ) or ( e , f ) both types of pockets ( 5% electron doping and @xmath119 ) . the last situation is obtained very close to the af quantum critical point , i.e. for @xmath120 . the leading solutions are shown in the first column and the sub - leading solutions are shown in the second column . in all three cases the leading solution is @xmath0 , and the sub - leading solution is @xmath2-wave . the latter differs from @xmath13-wave by being odd under @xmath121 and @xmath122 . note that in the case of hole doping the two solutions @xmath0 and @xmath2 are nearly degenerate with @xmath123 and @xmath124 . in the case of small and intermediate electron doping , the @xmath0 solution becomes strongly dominant . upon increased electron doping approaching the quantum critical point , the @xmath2-wave solution becomes increasingly important , although always subdominant . ]    for electron doping , the pairing interaction in the singlet channel is locally attractive for @xmath48 and @xmath50 residing on the same electron pocket , as shown in fig . [ fig : potalpha](a - b ) . attractive pairing occurs due to both longitudinal and transverse spin fluctuations . as opposed to the hole - doped case , it is the longitudinal fluctuations that mediate the strongest effective pairing . in this regime , it is clearly the @xmath0 solution which will be favored due to the symmetry @xmath125 . upon increasing the electron doping the purely attractive intrapocket interaction is replaced by partly repulsive regions and this will diminish the resulting superconducting gap value . in the triplet channel the pairings from both types of fluctuations will be quite weak , see fig . [ fig : potalpha](c - d ) . as in the case of hole doping , the longitudinal fluctuations support a @xmath1-wave gap since it is attractive for @xmath48 and @xmath50 located at the same side of the fermi pocket and repulsive for @xmath48 and @xmath50 on opposite sides , as shown in fig . [ fig : potalpha](c ) . the transverse fluctuations display the reverse structure as evident from in fig . [ fig : potalpha](d ) , which is the reason why the @xmath1-wave solution becomes suppressed also on the electron - doped side .      keeping in mind the structure of the pairing interactions described above , we now turn to the solutions to the linearized gap equation eq . ( [ eq : lge ] ) in order to determine the subleading solutions and the doping evolution of the three leading solutions . we consider three qualitatively different types of fermi surfaces . first , we study a fermi surface consisting of hole pockets at @xmath126 which occurs on the hole - doped side , see fig . [ fig : solutionslge](a ) . second , we turn to electron pockets at @xmath127 and @xmath128 which occur for small and intermediate electron doping levels , see fig .  [ fig : solutionslge](c ) , and third , we study the occurrence of both electron and hole pockets very close to critical doping as in fig . [ fig : solutionslge](e ) , i.e. the doping level for which af order disappears . as discussed above , the presence of hole pockets destabilizes the commensurate af by additional intrapocket contributions to the bare spin susceptibilities . in this case , we force stability of the commensurate af order by turning off the intrapocket contributions by hand , which is justified from the work by chubukov and frenkel@xcite showing that vacuum renormalization leads to a stability of the commensurate af order at small hole dopings .    by inspection of the intrapocket potential structure on the hole pocket shown in fig . [ fig : potbeta](a , b ) , we expect either of the two solutions @xmath0 or @xmath2 for the weakly hole - doped system . from the intrapocket potential structure it is not possible to qualitatively distinguish between these two solutions . the only other way that the system might choose one solution over the other would be from the structure of the pairing potential for @xmath48 on one hole pocket and @xmath50 on the neighboring pocket . however , from the numerical potential evaluation it turns out that the interpocket pairing contribution is an order of magnitude smaller than the intrapocket pairing and its symmetry does not favor one of the solutions over the other . this is the reason we obtain two nearly degenerate singlet solutions , namely @xmath0 and the @xmath2 solutions , in fig . [ fig : solutionslge](a , b ) . turning to the case of 5 % electron doping shown in fig . [ fig : solutionslge](c , d ) , we see that the @xmath0 solution is clearly favored over the sub - leading solution @xmath2 , which becomes strongly suppressed . this is a direct consequence of the intrapocket attraction between @xmath48 and @xmath50 residing on the same electron pocket . upon increasing doping , the electron pockets grow in size , but throughout the sdw region , the @xmath0 solution continues to be the leading solution although the sub - leading @xmath2-wave gets closer . also close to the crossover to the paramagnetic phase , where both electron and hole pockets are present at the fermi surface , the leading solution remains @xmath0 as shown in fig .  [ fig : solutionslge](e , f ) .    ) , are shown . the @xmath0 solution ( red line ) dominates at all fillings . the next - nearest neighbor hopping is @xmath92 and the bare coulomb interaction is @xmath91 . ] the complete doping evolution of the three leading superconducting order parameters , @xmath0 , @xmath2 , and @xmath129-wave , is shown in the phase diagram in fig . [ fig : phasediagramu3nt0p35 ] . on the hole - doped side , we limit the study to the underdoped region . very close to half filling we observe a near - degeneracy of the @xmath0 and @xmath2-wave solutions . the existence of two degenerate solutions in principle allows for their mixture as a trsb solution , or for orthorhombic distortions as a direct mixture . at the mean field level , the preference of a low temperature trsb solution might be expected when it is possible to remove gap nodes at the fermi surface , since removal of gaps from @xmath130 leads to a gain in the condensation energy . in the present case of the degenerate solutions @xmath0 and @xmath2 , however , we note that these share the same nodes along the zone diagonal . thus , there will be no apparent gain of energy by constructing a trsb solution of the form @xmath131 . in fact , solving the full gap equation as stated in eq . ( [ eq : scgapequation ] ) reveals that the @xmath0 solution is energetically favored . upon larger hole doping , the near - degeneracy of the @xmath0 and @xmath2-wave solutions is split and the @xmath0 solution becomes clearly dominant in this regime . in the case of electron doping , the @xmath3-wave solution is strongest very close to half filling even though this is not where the longitudinal and transverse pairing potentials achieve their maximum strengths , see fig . [ fig : potphasediagram ] . the reason is that in the limit where electron pockets are small , the structure of the intrapocket pairing potentials is purely attractive , as shown in fig .  [ fig : potalpha](a , b ) , and this strongly supports a @xmath3-wave solution . we note that this feature of a well - developed gap in the limit of small electron dopings is an inherent result of the weak - coupling approach to the coexistence phase . at critical electron doping for which @xmath132 , the fermi arcs just touch the magnetic zone boundary and as a consequence , nesting by @xmath133 on the paramagnetic side is rapidly weakened upon increased electron doping . the ordering of the leading solutions remains the same as in the sdw phase , with the @xmath129 solution , which in the paramagnetic phase takes the simpler form @xmath134\sin(k_x)$ ] , the least favorable . the paramagnetic fermi surface , which is a hole pocket centered at @xmath4 is roughly circular thereby preventing nesting not only at @xmath133 , but at any @xmath135-vector . as a result spin - fluctuation - mediated superconductivity rapidly dies off . the evolution of the @xmath0 solution was previously discussed in ref .  , where the possibility of a different pairing mechanism close to the crossover between sdw and paramagnetism was speculated . in ref . the pairing was treated at a phenomenological level and here we note that also the full treatment of the spin - mediated pairing gives rise to a rapid decrease in the superconductivity upon entering the paramagnetic region .    finally , we show estimations for the critical temperatures of the commensurate af order , @xmath136 , as well as the superconducting ordering temperature , @xmath137 in fig . [ fig : tempphasediagramu3nt0p35 ] . the @xmath137 is estimated from the eigenvalue @xmath103 obtained for the leading @xmath3-wave solution as a function of doping . whereas @xmath137 drops off upon increasing electron doping it shows the opposite evolution as a function of hole doping . at @xmath138 the superconducting instability is absent due to a full gapping of the fermi surface by the magnetic order . similar behavior was found by variational cluster perturbation theory in the work by snchal and coworkers . @xcite    , with the energy cut off set to @xmath139 and @xmath140 mev . the superconducting instability is @xmath0 at all fillings . the sdw region which is determined from the mean field gap equation is shown by the green area . the next - nearest neighbor hopping is @xmath92 and the bare coulomb interaction is @xmath91 . note that within the weak - coupling approach the sdw ground state is always metallic away from @xmath138 and therefore , does not cover the mott insulating behavior of in the underdoped region of hole - doped cuprates . ]    as discussed in the introduction , the results on the hole - doped side contradicts the recent findings of ref .  , where a @xmath1-wave solution appears as the leading instability . in fact , the cooper - pairing in ref . is mediated by an exchange interaction which involves only nearest neighbor sites , while in our approach the interaction potential in the cooper channel invokes effectively also sites which are farther apart . the similarity of the treatment of the coexistence phase in ref . and our approach allows for a direct comparison of the interaction hamiltonians . in the simplified case of only hole pockets at the fermi surface , the interaction hamiltonian reads generally @xmath141 in the _ t - j_-like model without double occupancy constraint employed in ref .  , the effective interaction entering eq . takes the form @xmath142 \nonumber \\ & & -j({{\bf k}}+{{\bf k}}')[n^2({{\bf k}},{{\bf k}}')+p^2({{\bf k}},{{\bf k } } ' ) ] , \nonumber \\ \label{eq : lugamma}\end{aligned}\ ] ] with @xmath143 $ ] and @xmath144 . by contrast , in the hubbard model the effective interaction entering eq . is given by @xmath145 with the longitudinal and transverse effective interactions stated in eqs . ( [ eq : gammaz ] ) and ( [ eq : gammapm ] ) . the lower sign of eq . ( [ eq : betahub ] ) belongs to the triplet channel and this is the source of an effective intrapocket repulsion on the hole - doped side as shown in fig . [ fig : potbeta](d ) . on the contrary , the effective interaction as stated in eq . ( [ eq : lugamma ] ) gives rise to a purely attractive triplet potential for @xmath48 and @xmath50 residing on the same hole pocket , and therefore the @xmath1-wave solution would indeed appear to be the dominating instability . note , however , that the model of ref .   can not be considered strictly as a strong - coupling limit of the single band hubbard model as it does not include a constraint for no double occupancies of the fermions explicitly . this could play an important role . for example , as mentioned in the introduction , the original strong - coupling study of unconventional superconductivity driven by the spin waves , studied within the _ t - j _ model with the constraint of no double occupancies , does find the d@xmath146-wave symmetry of the superconducting gap to be the only stable solution . @xcite      we introduced the possibility of additional pairing gaps in the coexistence phase in sec . [ sec : anomalouspairing ] . such anomalous pairings were neglected in the previous discussion , see figs . [ fig : potphasediagram]-[fig : tempphasediagramu3nt0p35 ] , where we demonstrated that the dominating symmetry of the normal intraband pairing gaps is @xmath0 at all doping values . now we address the question of whether the inclusion of anomalous interband gaps introduces essential modifications to this result . the anomalous gaps develop under the constraint that they must have the same parity as the normal intraband gaps . in the current case , this means that anomalous pairing gaps must necessarily be of even parity .    ) -([eq : gapanodownup ] ) for the electron - doped system with @xmath51-bands outside the energy cut off . the superconducting gap symmetry is @xmath0 for both normal and anomalous gaps . the next - nearest neighbor hopping is @xmath92 and the bare coulomb interaction is @xmath91 . the energy cut off set to @xmath147 . we show the absolute value of the gap averaged over @xmath48-states within the energy range @xmath148 , e.g. @xmath149 . within this energy range no normal superconducting gap develops on the @xmath51-band , i.e. @xmath150 . the dashed blue line shows @xmath151 in the case where all anomalous gaps are excluded . ] we solve the system of five coupled gap equations as stated in eqs . ( [ eq : daa])-([eq : gapanodownup ] ) numerically to obtain the fully self - consistent solutions in the coexistence phase . since we have not included any energy dependence of the effective pairing vertices , we restrict the momentum sums of eqs . ( [ eq : daa])-([eq : gapanodownup ] ) to states in the vicinity of the fermi surface . the effective potential for pair scattering between anomalous gaps , @xmath152 stated in eq . ( [ eq : gammaabab2 ] ) , formally includes a divergent contribution for @xmath153 . to avoid such contributions we cut off all pairings @xmath152 to a maximum value of @xmath154 . by this procedure , we find that also the anomalous gaps acquire a @xmath0 structure . in fig . [ fig : electronselfconsistent ] we present the normal and anomalous mean field gaps given in eqs . ( [ eq : daa])-([eq : gapanodownup ] ) in the case of an electron - doped system in the regime of well - developed sdw order . we show the gap value averaged over @xmath48-states close to the fermi surface , e.g. @xmath149 , where @xmath155 is the number of @xmath48-states with @xmath156 and @xmath157 is the cut off energy . upon approaching half filling where @xmath158 for this band , the self - consistent solutions gradually decrease . this differs from the results obtained for the linearized gap equation in fig . [ fig : phasediagramu3nt0p35 ] where the decrease is very abrupt . the gradual decrease in fig . [ fig : electronselfconsistent ] follows the decrease in the number of states within the energy range around the fermi surface towards half filling .     and @xmath159 and ( b ) the anomalous gap , @xmath160 . all gaps have @xmath0 structure . whereas the normal gaps show the same overall phase on electron and hole pockets , the anomalous gaps display an internal @xmath161-shift between the electron and hole pockets . ]    from the results presented in fig . [ fig : electronselfconsistent ] , it is evident that the mean field @xmath162 is the most important contributor to anomalous pairing whereas @xmath163 and @xmath164 are negligible . this illustrates the point that it is the linear coupling to the normal gaps via the pairing interaction @xmath165 of eq . ( [ eq : pairingaaab ] ) which generates the anomalous pairings . without this coupling term also the subdominant mean fields @xmath163 and @xmath164 would vanish . furthermore , the inclusion of anomalous pairings slightly enhances the size of the intraband gap . this is seen from fig . [ fig : electronselfconsistent ] by compairing @xmath151 as deduced from the self - consistent determination of all five gaps shown by blue circles with a full line with the self - consistent calculation of the normal intraband gaps alone , which is shown by the blue dashed line . in the latter case the gap magnitudes are slightly smaller . if hole pockets are included within the energy cut off , i.e. @xmath166 , the self - consistent calculation finds a @xmath161-shift of the anomalous superconducting phase at the hole pockets compared to the electron pockets , see fig . [ fig : phase ] ( b ) . this is a robust feature arising from the momentum structure of the normal - anomalous pair scattering potential and as a result of the internal sign between @xmath49- and @xmath51-operators in eq . ( [ eq : gapano ] ) . we have tested numerically that this result is insensitive to the relative ratio of normal and anomalous pairing potentials . lastly , we mention that the self - consistent gap solutions are all real - valued . therefore unlike the iron - based case studied in ref .  , we do not find a trsb superconductor in the coexistence phase . in conclusion , the incorporation of anomalous pairings in the effective interaction hamiltonian gives only small quantitative changes to the intraband gap results presented in the previous sections . this study represents a very detailed investigation of spin - fluctuation - mediated superconductivity in a system with well - developed itinerant antiferromagnetic order and includes a calculation of the complete coexistence phase diagram of the hubbard model . the spin fluctuations bear important fingerprints of the spin order with the transverse spin fluctuations corresponding to the goldstone mode of the spin - symmetry - broken state . we find that longitudinal and transverse spin fluctuations are equally important for the development of an effective pairing glue between the fermionic quasi - particles of the spin - density - ordered metal . both types of spin fluctuations act in concert in the even parity quasi - spin singlet channel and this gives rise to a robust gap solution of @xmath0 structure at all doping levels within the coexistence doping region . the situation is quite different in the case of odd parity quasi - spin triplet superconductivity . here longitudinal spin fluctuations promote a nodeless @xmath1-wave solution in the hole - doped system due to an effective intrapocket attraction . however , a strong intrapocket repulsive contribution from transverse fluctuations destroys this effective attraction and destabilizes the @xmath1-wave solution . thus , the coexistence phase treated within the hubbard model does not support a nodeless gap on the hole doped side , in contrast to a recent study of the coexistence phase within the @xmath11 model without double occupancy constraint . @xcite a modified version of the hubbard model in which the relative contribution from the transverse fluctuations is suppressed , could also stabilize a nodeless @xmath1-wave state . finally , we have investigated the additional interband pairing amplitudes that appear in the sdw phase as a consequence of the linear coupling to the normal intraband gaps . such anomalous pairing gaps are required to have the same parity under inversion as the normal intraband gaps . specifically , the anomalous pairing amplitudes also manifest a @xmath0 structure and the gap magnitude is similar to the normal pairing gaps . we thank a.v . chubukov , a. kreisel , and s. mukherjee for useful discussions , and w. rowe for her contributions to the early stages of this project . a. t. r. and b. m. a acknowledge support from a lundbeckfond fellowship ( grant a9318 ) . j. h. acknowledges support from nsf - dmr-1005625 . the work of i. e. was supported by the focus program 1458 eisen - pniktide of the dfg , and by the german academic exchange service ( ppp usa no . 57051534 ) . i. e. acknowledges the financial support of the ministry of education and science of the russian federation in the framework of increase competitiveness program of nust misis ( no . 2 - 2014 - 015 )                                                                      y. peng , j. meng , d. mou , j. he , l. zhao , y. wu , g. liu , x. dong , s. he , j. zhang , x. wang , q. peng , z. wang , s. zhang , f. yang , c. chen , z. xu , t. k. lee , and x. j. zhou , nat . comms . * 4 * , 2459 ( 2013 ) . m. yu . kuchiev and o.p . sushkov , physica c * 218 * , 197 ( 1993 ) ; v.v . flambaum , m.yu . kuchiev , and o.p . sushkov , physica c * 227 * , 267 ( 1994 ) ; v. i. belinicher , a. l. chernyshev , a. v. dotsenko , and o. p. sushkov , phys . b * 51 * , 6076 ( 1995 ) .","The text discusses the pairing of electrons in unconventional superconductors, specifically in the context of the one-band Hubbard model.

"a foundation for the understanding of critical phenomena was provided by wilson s renormalization group ( rg ) approach  @xcite which maps the critical point onto a fixed point of a certain transformation of the system s hamiltonian , langevin equation , etc . the rg theory presents a powerful tool to estimate the values of the critical exponents , it allows to predict which parameters determine the universality class and it explains the existence of an upper critical dimension  @xmath0 above which the mean - field theory applies . furthermore , crossover phenomena between two different universality classes are well understood in terms of competing fixpoints  ( see for instance  @xcite ) . nevertheless there are still some open aspects of crossover phenomena which are discussed in the literature . the question whether the crossover scaling functions are universal was revisited several times  @xcite . for instance it was shown recentlty that two different models , belonging to the same universality class , are characterized by the same ( universal ) crossover scaling functions  @xcite . this is remarkable , since the universal scaling behavior is usually restricted to a small vicinity around the critical point . in the case of a crossover the universal scaling functions span several decades in temperature or conjugated field . another question of interest concerns the so - called effective exponents  @xcite which can be defined as logarithmic derivatives of the corresponding scaling functions . it is still open whether these effective exponents fulfill over the full crossover the well - known scaling laws which connect critical exponents . this question is closely related to the more general and very important question whether effective exponents obey the scaling laws at all . for instance it is known experimentally  @xcite as well as theoretically  @xcite that the asymptotic scaling behavior is often masked by corrections to scaling , so - called confluent singularities . in this case it is useful to analyze the data in terms of effective exponents and the above question naturally arises  @xcite . thus the validity of the scaling laws for effective exponents was addressed in experimental works , rg approaches as well as numerical simulations . in particular the violation of the scaling laws for effective exponents was conjectured from a rg approximation  @xcite . but neither experimental nor numerical work could clearly confirm this conjecture so far . for instance binder and luijten considered numerically a crossover in the ising model and discussed the validity of the rushbrook scaling law  @xcite . the observed nonmonotonic crossover behavior suggests again a violation of the rushbrook scaling law . however it can not be considered as a rigorous proof .    in this work we consider a field driven crossover ( in the so - called critical crossover limit  @xcite ) in two different models exhibiting a non - equilibrium second order phase transition . varying the range of interactions we investigate the crossover from mean - field to non - mean - field scaling behavior . the order parameter and the order parameter susceptibility is measured as a function of the conjugated field and we are able to determine the corresponding effective exponents over the full crossover regime . our results show that the well - known widom scaling law is clearly violated for the effective crossover exponents . furthermore we present a simple analytical argument , suggesting that the scaling laws are valid for the asymptotic scaling regimes ( where the systems are characterized by a pure algebraic behavior ) , whereas the scaling laws do not hold for the crossover regime ( characterized by a non algebraic behavior ) . in the following we consider two different cellular automata exhibiting a so - called absorbing phase transition . the first model is the conserved transfer threshold process ( cttp )  @xcite . in this model lattice sites may be empty , occupied by one particle , or occupied by two particles . empty and single occupied sites are considered as inactive whereas double occupied lattice sites are considered as active . in the latter case one tries to transfer both particles of a given active site to randomly chosen empty or single occupied nearest neighbor sites . the second model is a modified version of the manna sandpile model  @xcite , the fixed - energy manna model  @xcite . in contrast to the cttp the manna model allows unlimited particle occupation of lattice sites . lattice sites which are occupied by at least two particles are considered as active and all particles are moved to the neighboring sites selected at random .    in our simulations ( see  @xcite for details ) we have used square lattices ( with periodic boundaries ) of linear size @xmath1 . all simulations start from a random distribution of particles . after a transient regime both models reach a steady state characterized by the density of active sites  @xmath2 . the density  @xmath2 is the order parameter and the particle density  @xmath3 is the control parameter of the absorbing phase transition , i.e. , the order parameter vanishes at the critical density  @xmath4 according to , @xmath5 , with the reduced control parameter @xmath6 . below the critical density ( in the absorbing phase ) the order parameter is zero in the steady state . similar to equilibrium phase transitions it is possible in the case of absorbing phase transitions to apply an external field  @xmath7 which is conjugated to the order parameter . the conjugated field has to act as a spontaneous creation of active particles , destroying the absorbing state and therefore the phase transition itself . furthermore , the associated linear response function @xmath8 has to diverge at the critical point ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) . a realization of the external field for absorbing phase transitions with a conserved field was recently developed in  @xcite where the external field triggers movements of inactive particles which may be activated in this way . at the critical density @xmath11 the order parameter scales as @xmath12 . using the conjugated field it is possible to investigate the equation of state  @xmath13 , i.e. , the order parameter as a function of both the control parameter and the external field . a recently performed scaling analysis reveals that the cttp and the manna model are characterized by the same critical exponents as well as by the same universal scaling form of the equation of state , i.e. , both models belong to the same universality class  @xcite .    according to the above definition particles of active sites are moved to nearest neighbors only , i.e. , the range of interactions is @xmath14 . it is straightforward to implement various ranges of interactions into these models  @xcite . in this modified models particles of active sites are moved ( according to the rules of each model ) to randomly selected sites within a radius  @xmath15 . since the dynamics of both considered models is characterized by simple particle hopping processes , various interaction ranges can be easily implemented and high accurate data are available . this is a significant advantage compared to e.g.  equilibrium system like the ising model where the increasing interaction range causes a slowing down of the dynamics .    for any finite interaction range the phase transition is characterized by non - mean - field scaling behavior which now takes place at the critical density  @xmath16 . a mean - field phase transition occur for infinite interactions ( @xmath17 ) only . but mean - field behavior could occur away from the critical point if the long range interactions reduce the critical fluctuations sufficiently . the crossover between the mean - field and non - mean - field scaling regimes is described by the famous ginzburg criterion  @xcite which states that the mean - field picture is self - consistent in the active phase as long as the fluctuations within a correlation volume are small compared to the order parameter itself . this leads for zero field to the crossover condition @xmath18 = 1 $ ] , with the crossover exponent @xmath19  @xcite . in order to avoid lattice effects we use the effective range of interactions  @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes the number of lattice sites within a radius  @xmath15 the crossover scaling function has to incorporate three scaling fields ( the control parameter , the external field , and the range of interactions ) , i.e. , we make the phenomenological ansatz @xmath22 where the universal scaling function @xmath23 is the same for all models belonging to a given universality class whereas all non - universal system - dependent features ( e.g.  the lattice structure , the update scheme , etc . ) are contained in the so - called non - universal metric factors @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26  @xcite . these factors are determined by three conditions which normalize the scaling function @xmath23 . first , the analytically known mean - field scaling function  @xcite @xmath27 should be recovered for @xmath28 , i.e. , @xmath29 . therefore , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , implying @xmath32 and @xmath33 . finally , the non - universal metric factor  @xmath26 can be determined by the condition @xmath34 for @xmath35 yielding  @xcite @xmath36 the metric factors were already determined in previous works  @xcite , thus no parameter fitting is needed in order to perform the following scaling analysis . of the order parameter of the cttp and manna model at the critical density for @xmath37 . the metric factors are given by @xmath38 and @xmath39 . the dashed lines correspond to the asymptotic behavior of the two -

called effective exponent  @xcite @xmath56 the perfect collapse of the corresponding data is shown in fig.[fig : uni_co_beta_eff ] and confirms again the universality of the crossover scaling function  @xmath23 .    . , width=302 ]    next we consider the order parameter susceptibility . the scaling form of the susceptibility is given by @xmath57 on the other hand the susceptibility is defined as the derivative of the order parameter with respect to the conjugated field @xmath58 with @xmath59 . by comparing this expression with eq.([eq : scal_ansatz_sucp_co ] ) we find @xmath60 , @xmath61 , as well as the widom scaling law @xmath62 which is well known from equilibrium phase transitions . again , the mean - field behavior is recovered for @xmath28 , i.e. , @xmath63 , implying @xmath64 , @xmath65 , as well as @xmath66 .     of the susceptibility of the cttp and the manna model at the critical density for @xmath37 . the metric factors are given by @xmath38 and @xmath67 . the dashed lines correspond to the asymptotic behavior of the two -

law amplitude is given by @xmath75    the rescaled susceptibility is shown in fig.[fig : uni_co_sucp_02 ] . over the entire crossover region we got an excellent data collapse including both asymptotic scaling regimes . the inset displays the effective exponent @xmath76 which exhibits again a monotonic crossover from the two - dimensional scaling regime to the mean - field scaling behavior . in this way we have obtained the effective exponents @xmath77 and @xmath78 for the field driven crossover from mean - field to non - mean - field behavior . thus we are able to check the corresponding widom scaling law @xmath79 for the whole crossover region . the corresponding data are shown in fig.[fig : widom_01 ] . as can be seen the widom scaling law is fulfilled for the asymptotic regimes ( @xmath37 scaling behavior and mean - field scaling ) but it is clearly violated for the intermediate crossover region . this result is not surprising if one notices that the above widom law [ eq.([eq : widom_eff ] ) ] corresponds to the differential equation [ see eqs.([eq : def_eff_exp_beta_sigma ] , [ eq : def_eff_exp_gamma_sigma ] ) ] @xmath80 using @xmath81 we get @xmath82 where @xmath83 is some constant . it is straightforward to show that this differential equation is solved by simple power - laws [ @xmath84 with @xmath85 . thus the widom scaling law is fulfilled in the asymptotic regimes only . in the case that the scaling behavior is affected by crossovers , confluent singularities , etc . no pure power - laws occur and the scaling laws do not hold for the corresponding effective exponents .    ) ] in the crossover regime . , width=302 ] in conclusion , the crossover from mean - field to non - mean - field scaling behavior is numerically investigated for two different models exhibiting a second order phase transition . increasing the range of interactions we are able to cover the full crossover region which spans several decades of the conjugated field . the corresponding data show that the widom scaling law is violated in the crossover regime . notice that we focus in our investigations on the particular universality class of absorbing phase transitions only for technical reasons . the demonstrated violation of the widom scaling can be applied to continuous phase transitions in general .","**Critical Phenomena in Field-Driven Crossover**

"in many crystal - growing procedures of interest , a nano - scale faceted surface appears and proceeds to evolve , often exhibiting coarsening and even dynamic scaling , whereby characteristic statistics describing the surface remain constant even as the characteristic lengthscale increases through the vanishing of small facets . for many evolving faceted surfaces , a _ facet velocity law _ can be observed @xcite , assumed @xcite , or derived @xcite which specifies the normal velocity of each facet , often in configurational form which depends on the geometry of the facet . in this way , the dynamics of a continuous , two - dimensional surface can be concisely represented by a discrete collection of such velocities , and overall computational complexity reduced to that of a system of ode s ; the resulting system is known as a _ piecewise - affine dynamic surface _ , or pads . such theoretical simplification , in turn , enables the large - scale numerical simulations necessary for the statistical investigation of coarsening and dynamic scaling . the numerics involved in the direct geometric simulation of an arbitrary pads is straightforward for one - dimensional surfaces , requiring nothing beyond traditional ode techniques except simple geometric translation between facet displacement and edge displacement , and a small surface correction associated with each coarsening event . consequently , such simulations accompany many of the above facet treatments of facet dynamics , and have also been independently repeated elsewhere @xcite . however , in two dimensions , the corrections due to coarsening events are much more involved , and any code must be able to deal with a family of non - coarsening _ topological events _ that alter the neighbor relations between nearby facets . consequently , the fewer simulation attempts use either fast but poentially imprecise envelope methods @xcite , or more robust but slower phase - field @xcite or level - set @xcite methods to avoid explicitly performing topological changes . besides the speed / accuracy trade - off exhibited by these approaches , both methods obscure the natural geometric simplicity of the native surface , complicating the extraction of detailed surface statistics which , after all , motivates large simulations in the first place . additionally , as will be seen , the presence of non - unique topological events requires explicit intervention regardless of topological scheme , which negates much of the advantage of a `` hands - free '' treatment .    in the previous chapter , we introduced a direct - simulation method which explicitly performs topological events along the way , thus preserving both simulation speed and topological accuracy . in addition , by representing the surface as a collection of facets , edges , and junctions , plus the neighbor relations between them , the method mirrors the natural geometry of the surface being modeled , which allows easy extraction of geometric statistics . there , however , the restricted case of threefold symmetry was chosen for ease of topological implementation ; under this symmetry , a limited number of topological events were observed , and both vanishing facets and non - vanishing surface rearrangements could be handled explicitly using a priori knowledge of the before and after surface states . while many surfaces exhibit threefold symmetry , making the method useful even in this special case , it could not handle other common crystal symmetries , notably fourfold and sixfold .    in this chapter , then , we generalize the previous model to allow the simulation of surfaces with arbitrary symmetry groups . we begin in section  [ sec : cellular - structure ] with a brief summary of the basic method , including surface representation , facet kinematics , and the application of a dynamics . next , in section  [ sec : topological events ] , we provide a careful enumeration of topological events which may occur on surfaces of arbitrary symmetry ; this includes discussion of the far - field reconnection algorithm , by which network holes left by vanishing facets may be consistently repaired without knowledge of the post - event state . then , we provide in section  [ sec : discretization and topology ] a careful consideration of the consequences of using ( necessarily discrete ) timesteps during the simulation of a surface whose evolution equations change qualitatively between steps ( at topological events ) ; the issues that arise are discussed in the context of three sample strategies . the completed method is illustrated from three- , four- , and six - fold symmetric surfaces in section  [ sec : demonstration ] ; these exhibit all of the topological events likely to be encountered on a real surface , and demonstrate that the method is robust enough to generically simulate faceted surfaces of any symmetry class for which a facet - velocity law is uniquely specified . finally , in addition to detailing the ffr algorithm , the appendix includes a discussion of kinematically non - unique topological events , where two resolutions are possible , and highlights the need to refer to the dynamics or even first principles to decide how the surface should evolve in those cases . we consider the evolution of a single - valued , fully - faceted surface @xmath1 ; this definition explicitly forbids overhangs and inclusions . we assume that the surface bounds a single crystal which exists on exactly one lattice ; thus , we are not treating surfaces with multiple grains . the surface is piecewise - affine , consisting of facets @xmath2 with fixed normals @xmath3 . these are bounded by and meet at edges @xmath4 which are necessarily straight line segments ; edges in turn meet at triple - junctions @xmath5 . this three - component structure is reminiscent of two - dimensional _ cellular networks _ @xcite and indeed , while we consider three dimensional surfaces , the projection of the edge set onto the plane @xmath6 is a 2d cellular network . this structure and the neighbor relations inherent within it suggest a doubly - linked object - oriented data structure , consisting of : ( 1 ) a set of junctions , each having a location , pointing to three edges and three facets ; ( 2 ) a set of edges , each having a tangent , pointing to two junctions and two facets ; and ( 3 ) a set of facets , each having a normal , pointing to @xmath7 edges and @xmath7 junctions . these objects and the associated neighbor relations are illustrated in figure  [ fig : neighbor - relations ] ; this structure is the natural structure of the surface , and uniquely and exactly describes it . we now consider each element in more detail . [ fig : neighbor - relations ]      a _ junction _ is a point in space formed where edges ( and hence , facets ) intersect . the * order * @xmath8 of a junction is simply the number of edges which meet there . while junctions of any order @xmath9 are possible , we restrict ourselves here to the case of order @xmath10 junctions or `` triple junctions . '' this greatly simplifies analysis and code , as triple junctions are uniquely positioned by the three facets meeting there . the intrinsic geometric information carried by a junction is its location . junctions are stored in a ` junction ` class , which contains this location , as well as pointers to the three edges and three facets which meet there . an _ edge _ is a line segment formed by the intersection of exactly two facets , and bounded by exactly two junctions . the intrinsic geometrical quantity of an edge is its orientation , which is fixed since facets have fixed normals . edges are stored in the ` edge ` class , which records the tangent , as well as pointers to the two neighboring facets and two bounding junctions . at creation , edges are `` directed '' : one junction is arbitrarily deemed the origin , and the other the terminus , establishing a _ tangent_. this has two important consequences . first , if we imagine walking along the edge in the tangent direction , then one neighboring facet may be labeled `` left '' , and the other `` right . '' this information allows us to distinguish between convex and concave edges , and also to determine the clockwise direction around a given facet , which is necessary for effective navigation of the network , as well as the proper calculation of boundary integrals on facets . second , the tangent allows us to detect when an edge `` flips '' ( see @xcite ) ; this will be discussed in more detail in section  [ sec : topology - class-1 ] .      a facet is a simply - connected planar polygonal region in space , which is bounded by an equal number of edges and junctions . the intrinsic geometric information carried by a facet is its normal , which is fixed . our surface definition @xmath11 requires that the normal of each facet is constrained to be on the hemispherical shell of unit - length vectors with positive @xmath12 component . the imposition of a particular symmetry on the crystal may further restrict available normals , but no such restriction is here assumed . facets are stored in a ` facet ` class , which contains the normal , as well as a list of bounding edges and junctions , sorted in counter - clockwise order . the intrinsic geometric means of characterizing surface evolution is by specifying the normal velocity of each point on the surface . a piecewise - affine surface is composed of a collection of planar , fixed - normal facets , whose motion is limited to displacement along the normal . therefore , the kinematics @xmath13 of the entire surface may be expressed by a discrete set of individual facet velocities @xmath14 . as edges and junctions are merely intersections between two and three facets , respectively , their motion is uniquely specified by the motion of the facets that neighbor them . in particular , if @xmath15 is the location in space of a triple junction , then the velocity of that a triple junction may be calculated through the expression @xmath16 where the rows of @xmath17 and entries of @xmath18 are the unit normals and normal velocity , respectively , of the three facets intersecting to form @xmath15 . in practice , facet velocities are only used indirectly to calculate junction velocities  if junctions are moved correctly , edges ( connections between two junctions ) and thus faces ( collections of edges ) are necessarily moved correctly as well . all that remains now is to select a particular dynamics ; that is , to specify an expression for the normal velocity @xmath14 of each facet . having chosen one , we follow @xcite and refer to the resulting evolving structure as a piecewise - affine dynamic surface ( @xmath19 ) . example dynamics describing many different physical situations were listed in the introduction , and the exact dynamics is not of special concern here ( although we will select one for demonstration later ) . it is worth noting here , however , that most of the dynamics proposed to date are _ configurational _ , depending on properties of the facet such as area , perimeter , number of junctions , or mean height . thus , sudden changes in the geometric properties of a facet can lead to sudden changes in its velocity , an issue which will be explored in more detail in section  [ sec : discretization and topology ] . we have just discussed how elements of each class ( facet , edge , vertex ) neighbor members from each of the other classes . taken together , the set of all of these neighbor relations comprises the * topological state * of the surface . it is a complete record of every neighbor relationship on the surface , and is unique for a given surface . as the system evolves , these neighbor - relations may change as facets exchange neighbors , join together , split apart , or vanish . each of these cases is an example of a * topological event * , and represents a change to the topological state of the surface ( topological events are a defining feature of evolving cellular networks  again see @xcite ) . to maintain an accurate representation of the surface , a direct geometric method like that described here must manually perform topological events as necessary . because actual surface evolution is fairly trivial , this is the main difficulty of our method . a natural first question to ask at this point is `` how many topological events are possible ? '' to begin answering this question , we point out that on a physical surface , topological events occur automatically , and by geometric necessity . if a detected event signals the need to change neighbor relationships at some location on the surface , we may therefore infer that failing to change them would produce a cellular network with `` wrong '' relationships , that do not correspond to a physical surface . we call such erroneous configurations * geometrically inconsistent * ; examples include primarily edge networks that intersect when viewed from above , since these correspond to overhangs and inclusions , which are prohibited . since topological events serve to avoid possible geometric inconsistencies , we may discover what events are possible by considering how inconsistencies may occur . this is most easily accomplished by considering each surface element in turn . we first consider junctions , which are simply a location in space . a junction can , in the course of surface evolution , leave the periodic domain , in which case it is wrapped to the other side . however , this is only a bookkeeping operation , and does not represent a real topological event . turning to edges , we note that edges possess a directed length . as already hinted in section  [ sec : edges ] , this length could become negative if the edge were to `` flip '' @xcite a flipped edge has no geometrical meaning on a single - valued surface , and so we introduce a class of * vanishing edge * events which occur when edges reach zero length . finally , we consider facets . since a facet has fixed orientation , its changing properties are loosely its shape and size . specifically , a facet is a _ simply connected _ planar region with _ positive area_. these two defining properties of facets lead , through consideration of their potential violation , to two additional classes of topological event : * facet constriction * events which prevent the formation of self - intersecting facets , and * vanishing facet * events which remove facets from the network when they reach zero area .      an adjacent point - point event occurs when an edge shrinks to zero length , and its junctions meet . to consider what might happen to the faceted surface when this occurs , we first label the immediate surroundings of an edge . each edge is composed of two faces of which it is the intersection , its * composite faces * , and stretches between two faces at which it terminates , its * terminal faces*. in addition , we will also use the term * emanating edges * to refer to those edges immediately neighboring the shrinking edge . now , consider the hemispherical shell of available facet normals ( section  [ sec : faces ] ) . the ( necessarily distinct ) normals of the composite faces specify a great circle about this hemisphere , which divides it into two parts . the normals of the terminal faces can not lie on this boundary , and unless they are identical ( a special case ) , they form a second great circle around the hemisphere . while terminal normals may not lie on the composite great circle , the reverse is not true , and this fact effectively divides vanishing edge events into three sub - classes .    [ fig : shrinking edge classes ]    figure  [ fig : shrinking edge classes ] illustrates this idea , and gives an example of each of the three possible cases . if the terminal great circle touches neither composite point , then the well - studied * neighbor switch * occurs . if the terminal great circle touches one composite point , then an * irregular neighbor switch * results . finally , if the terminal normals occupy the same point , then no great circle is defined  the terminal facets have he same normal , and when the edge between them shrinks to zero , they join into a single facet : a * facet join*.      on a general surface , the most common vanishing edge event is the neighbor switch , which is frequently encountered in other evolving cellular networks . in this event , neither composite normal touches the terminal great circle , so any three of the normals involved form a linearly independent set  this property is the defining feature of the neighbor switch . when an edge with this configuration shrinks to zero length , the surrounding facets simply exchange neighbors . figure [ fig : t1-illustration ] gives an example of this event . +    [ fig : t1-illustration ]    _ resolution . _ the neighbor switch is performed by the ` ns_repairman ` class . to resolve this event , it simply deletes the old edge , and creates a new edge . the composite faces which formed the old edge become terminal faces of the new edge , and cease to neighbor each other . conversely , the terminal faces of the old edge become the composite faces of the new edge , and thus become neighbors . this symmetric exchange in neighbor relations is the cause of the name neighbor switch , which comes from the grain - growth literature  the less - descriptive name `` t1 process '' in often used in the soap froth literature . in addition to replacing the vanishing edge , the junctions on either side of this edge are replaced . each new junction is formed by the intersection of the deleted edge s ( formerly non - adjacent ) terminal faces with one of its composite faces . _ comments . _ readers familiar with other cellular - network literature will note that the example neighbor switch in figure  [ fig : t1-illustration ] lacks the typical `` x '' shape . this is due to the constrained nature of facet normals , and hence , edge orientations . additionally , we note that the neighbor switch is a reversible event ; in fact it is its own reversal . finally , a certain sub - class of neighbor switches posessing `` saddle '' structure are non - unique , as was observed by thijssen @xcite . for a discussion of this non - uniqueness and its consequences , see appendix  [ sec : non - uniqueness ] . when the normal of one of the composite faces lies on the great circle formed by the terminal normals , the neighbor switch can not occur . here , the terminal faces can not form a new junction with the offending composite face because the three normals involved are not independent . instead , when an edge with this configuration shrinks to zero , two closely related events are possible , depending on the configuration of the nearby edges . these events are collectively called irregular neighbor switches , with two varieties called a `` gap opener '' and `` gap closer '' that are exact opposites . these are illustrated in figure  [ fig : gap opener ] . [ fig : gap opener ]    _ resolution . _ the irregular neighbor switch is performed by the ` ins_repairman ` class . because one composite normal lies on the terminal great circle , exactly two of the emanating edges are parallel in @xmath20 . the gap opener occurs when these edges emanate from the shrinking edge in _ opposite _ directions , while the gap closer occurs when the edges emanate in the _ same _ direction . to resolve the gap opener , we select one of the parallel emanating edges to be split apart ( see below ) . the gap will go here , filled by the terminal face that touches the other parallel edge , and will extend all the way to the far end of the split edge , where a new edge is introduced to link the two edges resulting from the split edge . this is all illustrated in figure  [ fig : gap opener ] . to resolve the gap closer , simply reverse the steps . _ comments . _ several comments on this pair of events are in order . first , while the gap closer is uniquely resolved , the gap - opener is an inherently non - unique event , as either of the parallel edges could be the one split ( we will discuss this further in section  [ sec : non - uniqueness ] ) . second , both resolution options have the potentially dissatisfying property of being non - local in effect , because the collision of two junctions causes an entire edge to split apart . what is perhaps more likely is the nucleation of a new , tiny facet at the moment the junctions collide ; however , we have excluded that possibility from consideration here . finally , while common experimentally - encountered surfaces usually have either high symmetry ( only a few facet orientations ) or no symmetry ( as many orientations as facets ) , the irregular neighbor switch with its three coplanar orientations requires what may be called `` intermediate symmetry , '' where orientations are limited , but many are available . because it poses resolution difficulties , and because it is not encountered in any surfaces we wish to study , we have not yet actually implemented this event . finally , we consider the special case where the terminal normals are identical . when such an edge shrinks to zero length , the terminal faces meet exactly . having the same orientation , they then join to form a larger face . figure  [ fig : face - join - illustration ] depicts a representative facet join event . [ fig : face - join - illustration ]    _ resolution . _ facet joins are performed by the ` fjoin_repairman ` class . to perform a facet join , a new face is created to replace the joining faces , and all edges and junctions that neighbored the old faces are re - assigned to this new face . next , the vanishing edge and its two junctions are deleted , leaving the four emanating edges to be considered . these are most logically grouped into the ( necessarily parallel ) pairs of edges bordering , respectively , the left and right composite faces of the vanished edge . in the example event shown in figure [ fig : face - join - illustration ] , these two pairs look different : one pair meets side - to - side , while the other pair meets end - to - end . computationally , however , this makes no difference ; each pair is replaced by a single edge connecting their remaining non - deleted junctions . this behavior is generic for all face joins . _ comments . _ we note that the face join is , strictly speaking , non - reversible ( though see section  [ sec : face - split ] ) . the exact opposite of the face join would be a facet which spontaneously `` shatters , '' as described in @xcite ; this behavior is certainly worth studying , but is not currently implemented . second , although this is a `` special case '' in general , for high - symmetry crystal surfaces it may be very common  indeed , for the case of a cubic crystal with only three available facet orientations considered in chapter 2 , facet joins are the only vanishing edge event exhibited . finally , we note that this event is the only vanishing edge event which does not conserve the number of facets . it is , in fact , one mechanism by which coarsening may occur , and may be the dominant mechanism for high - symmetry surfaces . the second class of topological event occurs whenever a facet ceases to be simply - connected , and results in that facet being split into two new facets . remembering that the edges of a facet trace out a polygon in the plane , we observe that the non - simply connected polygon , if allowed to continue evolving , would become self - intersecting , which clearly has no geometrical interpretation . so , how may an evolving polygon become self - intersecting ? since the boundary consists of edges and junctions , there are three possible modes : ( a ) two non - adjacent junctions meet , ( b ) a junction meets an edge , or ( c ) two edges meet . each case has a distinct `` signature , '' illustrated in figure  [ fig : self - intersection - signatures ] , which can be used to tell them apart . [ fig : self - intersection - signatures ]    the junction - junction collision shown in figure  [ fig : self - intersection - signatures]a represents the formation of a perfect @xmath21 junction . while theoretically interesting , such events are not considered here ; we hypothesize that , given random initial data , two junctions not connected by an edge will never exactly meet . furthermore , by considering figure  [ fig : self - intersection - signatures ] , it can be seen that all junction - junction collisions , if perturbed as we hypothesize , result in either junction - edge or edge - edge collisions , and can therefore be resolved accordingly . junction - edge collisions occur when a facet is pinched into two pieces by three of its neighbors , depicted in figure  [ fig : self - intersection - signatures]b . there , two adjacent neighbors of the facet , forming a wedge , meet a third neighbor and pierce it . two separate events are possible in this class . in most cases , the wedge simply splits the central facet into two parts , in an event called a * facet pierce*. however , if the normals of the wedge facets and the normal of the central facet lie on the same great circle , then , as the central facet is split , the opposing facet opens up a gap in the wedge : an * irregular facet pierce*.    edge - edge collisions occur when a facet is pinched by four neighbors , shown in figure  [ fig : self - intersection - signatures]c . in these events , two non - adjacent , exactly parallel edges meet , which requires that the normals of the impinging facets be coplanar with the normal of the pinched facet . again , two variations are possible . if the impinging faces have different normals , the event is called a * facet pinch*. however , if they have the same normal , they join even as they pinch the facet in question , in a process called a * joining facet pinch*. in addition , each event may occur in either symmetrical or asymmetrical flavors , which are shown in figure  [ fig : self - intersection - signatures]c1,c2 respectively . the meeting of two edges requires the involvement of two junctions ; these lie on the same edge for the symmetrical case , and on different edges for the asymmetrical case , as seen in the figure . the first self - intersection we will study is the simplest ; the facet pierce . it is a point - line event as described above ; that is , a facet is split when a triangular wedge formed by two adjacent neighboring facets intersects the edge formed with a third , opposing neighbor . the facet pierce is functionally the opposite of a facet join , and is illustrated in figure  [ fig : face - split - illustration ] . [ fig : face - split - illustration ]    _ resolution . _ each facet pierce is performed by the ` fjoin_repairman ` class . given the constricted facet , as well as the junction and edge which meet , it can label all of the surrounding facet elements and deterministically reconnect them correctly . first , two new facets are created to replace the constricted facet . the junctions and edges that bordered the old facet can be reassigned to these based on the labels created initially . the colliding junction and edge are deleted , to be replaced by three new junctions and two new edges . the locations of the former and neighbor relationships of each can be determined by considering figure  [ fig : face - split - illustration ] and using the labels . _ comments . _ first , technically , at the moment of the event , an @xmath22 junction forms , which as shown in figure  [ fig : face - split - illustration ] may proceed to break in one of three ways . this does not , however , constitute a non - uniqueness ; rather , the dynamics governing the surface evolution at the moment of topological change specify which exit pathway is chosen . second , while thijssen @xcite rightly objected to this resolution for the case of separate grains , we find it satisfactory for the case of a single crystal considered here . a special modification of the facet pierce just described occurs when the normal of the opposing facet shares a great circle with the normals of the facets forming the wedge . this event is called an irregular facet pierce . recall that three new junctions were created during the facet pierce . however here , since the two newly created facets have identical normals , and the remaining three have normals which are not independent , those junctions can not be created . instead , as the wedge facets meet the opposing facet , one of two things happen  either the center edge of the wedge is split apart by the opposing facet ( a `` wedge split '' ) , or the opposing facet is split apart by the wedge ( a `` wedge extension '' ) . we see an illustration of each possibility in figure  [ fig : table - split - illustration ] . [ fig : table - split - illustration ]    _ resolution . _ the irregular facet pierce is performed by the ` ifp_repairman ` class , which at instantiation is given the constricted facet , as well as the junction and edge which meet . this event is repaired quite similarly to the regular facet pierce , with modifications . as is done there , two new facets are created to replace the constricted facet , and junctions and edges bordering the old facet are reassigned to the new ones . the resolution differs in how to replace the colliding junction and edge . if the `` wedge split''resolution is chosen , then the middle edge of the wedge and its far junction are also deleted these are replaced by two parallel edges and junctions . finally , an edge is formed which links them and borders the facet on the far side of the deleted edge . if the `` wedge extension '' resolution is chosen , not only is the constricted facet split apart , but so is the one opposite the edge split by the wedge . one must first determine which edge of this second split facet the extended wedge will intersect . having done so , that facet is deleted , to be replaced by two new facets . the extension is formed by adding two edges parallel to the middle edge of the wedge , and the edge it intersects is split in two . two new edges and three junctions must be created to link the extension with the edge it intersects . finally , all edges and junctions bordering the deleted facet , plus those created to form the extension , are re - assigned appropriately to the new facets . figure  [ fig : table - split - illustration ] is especially helpful here . _ comments . _ the event clearly recalls the `` gap opener '' described above . it shares with that event three coplanar surface normals , and as a result , two possible resolutions . additionally , while the two options here are qualitatively different compared to the symmetric options of the gap opener , they are additionally both non - local effects due to a local cause . again , perhaps the best resolution is to nucleate a new facet , which we do not yet consider . finally , both events require `` intermediate symmetry , '' and for the same reasons discussed above , we have not implemented this event . we now turn to consider the case of edge - edge events , the first of which is called a face pinch . here the normals of the pinching facets are not identical , and so junctions can be created as needed  an illustration of this event is shown in figure  [ fig : face - pinch - illustration ] . this event is philosophically similar to the face split described above . in each case , a facet is split into two by non - joining neighbors ; the difference is just whether the procedure is `` sharp '' or `` blunt '' ; i.e. , caused by parallel edges or a junction and an edge . [ fig : face - pinch - illustration ]    _ resolution . _ each facet pinch is performed by the ` fpinch_repairman ` class . because of the similarities between the facet pierce and facet pinch , the associated ` repairman ` classes behave similarly as well . here , the ` repairman ` class constructor takes the constricted facet and the two colliding edges . with this information , it can label all of the surrounding facet elements and deterministically achieve the change shown in figure  [ fig : face - pinch - illustration ] . as with the facet pierce , two new facets are created to replace the constricted facet , and the junctions and edges that bordered the old facet are reassigned as required . the colliding edges are deleted , as are the associated junctions discussed above . five edges and four junctions are created to complete the reconnection , as shown in figure  [ fig : face - pinch - illustration ] . _ comments . _ this event , like the irregular neighbor switch and irregular facet pierce , requires a surface with `` intermediate symmetry . '' while it is uniquely resolved and poses no great difficulty of implementation , we have not yet implemented it for this reason . finally , a special modification of the face - pinch occurs when the impinging facets have identical normals . the constricted is split in exactly the same way as in a face pinch ; however , since the two facets doing the `` pinching '' are identically oriented , they join together to form a larger facet . we see an illustration of this situation in figure  [ fig : face - swap - illustration ] . [ fig : face - swap - illustration ]    _ resolution . _ each joining facet pinch is performed by the ` jfpinch_repairman ` class , which operates similarly to the ` repairman ` classes associated with the facet pierce and facet pinch . this class is again instantiated with the constricted facet and the two meeting edges , which allows the necessary labeling . again , two new facets are created to replace the constricted facet , but in this case the two facets which meet must join , and so another new facet must be created to replace them necessary junction and edge reassignments are again easily carried out . finally , rather than deleting the edges which meet and the associated junctions involved , the meeting edges are simply re - connected as shown in figure  [ fig : face - swap - illustration ] . _ comments . _ note that the final configuration is similar to the original configuration ; in fact , with suitable facet motion , the surface could return to its original configuration via another face swap ; the event is thus self - reversible in a sense . also , since both a facet pinch and a facet join occur simultaneously , the total numbers of each surface element remain unchanged during this event . the final class of topological event occurs when a facet shrinks to zero area and is removed . however , as has been noted numerous times previously in the context of cellular networks , very small facets can result in stiff dynamics that are difficult to numerically simulate accurately . for this reason , we follow previous authors by pre - emptively removing facets with areas below some small threshold ( but see section  [ sec : pure - predictive - method ] ) . this process is summarized in figure  [ fig : facet - removal - illustration ] . there , we see a single small flat facet vanishing into a pentagonal well ( [ fig : facet - removal - illustration]a ) . being smaller than the allowed threshold , it is removed , leaving a `` hole '' in the network ( [ fig : facet - removal - illustration]b ) . the facets and edges bordering this hole we call the * far field * , and they need to be reconnected correctly to patch the hole . the correct reconnection for this particular well is shown in figure  [ fig : facet - removal - illustration]c . [ fig : facet - removal - illustration ]    the principal difficulty in this process occurs during the reconnection step ( figure  [ fig : facet - removal - illustration]c ) . here , we are assigning new neighbor relationships to the far - field facets , which also involves the creation of new edges and junctions to form boundaries between them . in other cellular - network problems , these neighbor relationships ( and hence the reconnection ) is usually chosen randomly , under the reasoning that any error introduced is small enough to neglect and quickly corrected . however , because the faceted - surface network represents a piecewise - planar geometrical surface , we are not free to choose randomly . since each facet in the far field has a normal and a local height , neighbor relationships determine junction locations and thus edge placement . however , the final reconnection must be geometrically consistent  all facets must be simply connected , and thus no edges may intersect . if we were to randomly choose our neighbor relationships , the resulting reconnection would likely fail this test , and would thus represent a non - physical `` surface . '' to guarantee a geometrically consistent reconnection , we must search through all _ virtual _ reconnections until we find one that does not result in any self - intersecting facets .    several questions immediately arise :    1 : :    how can we effectively characterize a `` reconnection '' ? 2 : :    how many virtual reconnections are there to search ? 3 : :    how can we efficiently list all these choices ? 4 : :    can we be sure a good reconnection exists ? 5 : :    is this reconnection unique ?    for our method to be effective , all but the last of these questions must be answered satisfactorily . the detailed answers to ( 1 - 3 ) are found in the appendix , but we will summarize them here . the edges and junctions created during an @xmath23 reconnection may be effectively characterized as a binary tree with @xmath24 nodes . the number of @xmath25noded binary trees is given by the _ catalan number _ @xmath26 . finally , these trees may be efficiently listed using a greedy recursive algorithm in @xmath27 time . for the fourth question regarding existence , we argue heuristically that a facet reaching zero area proves the existence of its own reconnection , since a surface with a zero - area facet is functionally the same as the surface with that facet removed . we then assume the existence of that same reconnection for some window of time before the facet reaches zero . a fuller proof would appeal to manifold theory . finally , the fifth question regarding uniqueness is addressed in section  [ sec : non - uniqueness ] . having established these facts , we have a robust method for reconnecting an arbitrary far field of facets . before considering some special cases of this method , let us summarize the general process so far : whenever facets smaller than a threshold area are detected , we :    a : :    remove them , leaving a hole in the mesh . b : :    list all virtual reconnections ( vr s ) as n - node binary trees . c : :    use associated neighbor relationships to find edge locations . d : :    test each vr until one with no intersecting edges is found . we note that this approach represents a comprehensive reconnection method for _ any _ cellular network problem . though it is necessary for the faceted surface problem , it may be useful in any situation where a verifiably optimal reconnection is sought . it is possible for _ groups _ of facets to shrink together , in such a way that they can not be removed sequentially . for an example , consider the configurations in figure  [ fig : volume - removal ] . in such a case , it is necessary to identify and collect a contiguous group of small facets for simultaneous deletion  we call this a * near field*. any facet neighboring the near field is assigned to the far field , which may be reconnected as described previously after the near field is deleted . [ fig : volume - removal ]    to gather the near - field facets , we maintain a second , more liberal threshold . whenever a face shrinks below the first threshold , as described above , its neighbors are recursively examined to collect those smaller than the second threshold . this method is rather simplistic , and , in cases of oddly - shaped pyramids , may not return the entire near field . this , in turn , will result in an incorrect far field , which will most likely be non - reconnectable . however , a group of facets vanishing together eventually all head to zero area , and for some window of time before they would physically vanish , all are small enough to be detected in this way . thus , we allow the code to `` skip over '' small facet combinations that it can not remove successfully , and try again during a future timestep . it is also possible , on high - symmetry crystal surfaces , that the small facet or group of facets forms a `` step '' between two much larger facets of identical orientation , but different height . figure  [ fig : step - removal ] illustrates this situation , in which the near field is bounded by exactly four facets , two of which have identical orientations . in such a case , the final fate of the surface is that the small facets vanish _ as the large facets join together_. the method described above contains no provision for joining far - field facets during reconnection , and so there is no way to reconnect the far field produced in this case . [ fig : step - removal ]    having identified a near field as forming a step , one solution is to delete the small facets , then move the two large faces to the same height and join them . this results in two pairs of unconnected edges , which are each deleted and replaced with an appropriate single edge . since facet groups forming steps are , in fact , bordered by four facets generically , a separate ` repairman ` class could be written to handle this case . however , the small adjustment to the positions of the large facets can lead to subtle problems , as will be seen in section  [ sec : discretization and topology ] . therefore , a more robust if less elegant approach is to simply add one of the large parallel facets to the ( step - forming ) near field ; a good choice is the one with fewer edges . since the far field surrounding this modified near field requires no joins , it can be repaired using the ffr method . again , failures are possible as described in the above section , but resolution is always possible near enough to the time the event would physically occur . we have now discussed the general kinematics of a @xmath19 , and surveyed all topological events which may occur as the surface evolves . before our treatment is complete , however , we must consider with care the application of a time - stepping scheme . the accurate performance of topological events under such a scheme is problematic because , while events on a continuously evolving surface happen at precise times ( @xmath28 at @xmath29 ) , any time - stepping method invariably skips over these times . this has three consequences , concerning detection , consistency , and accuracy . after discussing them briefly , we will present three possible timestepping methods which illustrate them in more detail . * detection . * because timestepping will always skip over moments of topological change , we must abandon hope of simply finding topological events ready to perform . instead , we must either look ahead before each timestep and anticipate when events will occur ( a _ predictive _ method ) ; or step before looking , and then by examining the network infer where events should have occurred ( a _ corrective _ method ) . class a events can be easily be detected either way , while class b events are easier to correct , and class c are easier to predict . * consistency . * once the occurrence of an event has been detected by either means , it must be performed in a way that preserves geometric consistency i.e. , the network always corresponds to a physical surface @xmath30 . for example , two joining facets can only be mechanically fused if they exhibit the same local height . if , in addition to the occurrence of an event , a detection scheme can determine the exact time at which it occurred , then one strategy is to move the network to the precise event time , at which resolution is trivial . however , one may wish to attempt resolutions at other times , and the geometric consequences of doing so must be weighed . * accuracy * finally , we must consider the possibility of error that is produced during topological change . this error is most easily understood if we view the evolving surface in its abstract form as a highly nonlinear system of ode s . the ( usually configurational ) evolution function is moderated by the topological state ; thus , topological events can represent sudden , qualitative changes in the evolution function . a naive time - stepping scheme which steps over these without appropriate measures will produce large localized errors at moments of topological change . assume that , at all times , we accurately predict the time and location of the next topological event . then , a straightforward timestepping strategy which avoids consistency and accuracy concerns is to continually calculate the time of the next topological event ( accurate to the the order of the time - stepping method ) , and then step from event to event . under this approach , time is divided into slices with constant equations of motion , guaranteeing that that the system always evolves under the correct equations , and accurately representing the continuously evolving surface . in addition , high - order single - step methods such as runga - kutta methods may be used to obtain high accuracy .    though neatly eliminating consistency and accuracy concerns , this method has a serious disadvantage . the frequency of topological events scales with the system size , and since we can never step farther than the next event , we effectively make the timestep dependent on system size  @xmath31 . since moving the system through a single timestep is itself an @xmath32 operation , then advancing the system through any @xmath33 period of time takes @xmath34 time . while acceptable for the detailed study of a small surface , it is obviously undesirable for the statistical study of large surfaces this is chiefly because , consistency concerns aside , it makes little sense to halt the entire surface at every single topological event , when each of these involves only a few facets . thus , our next method has as its chief objective the use of timesteps which are independent of system size . a second strategy is to take fixed timesteps , use a corrective method of topological detection , and attempt to perform topological corrections late . since timestep is independent of system size , many events will now occur per timestep , the size of which is chosen to produce a fixed small _ percentage _ of facets undergoing topological change each step . while this approach theoretically eliminates the @xmath34 contribution to running time , it introduces hurdles to event detection , as well as geometrically consistent and accurate resolution .    * detection . * we just stated that , in this corrective detection scheme , more than one event occurs per timestep . whether or not this is a problem depends on the * domain of influence * of each event , defined to be the set of network elements that event affects . if these sets contain no common elements , then the associated events occur too far apart in space to affect each other  they are independent . consequently , a detection routine can hand them in arbitrary order to the repair routines , there to be confidently performed in isolation . however , occasionally two or more domains of influence overlap . in this situation , called a * discrete compound event * , the associated topological events are no longer independent , and a detection routine can no longer ensure _ a priori _ their correct , consistent resolution when handed off . even worse , the very signatures used to identify separate events may be obscured in the resulting `` tangle , '' such that the routine does not even recognize what has happened . given the variety of event signatures described in section  [ sec : topological events ] , and the many combinations in which they might occur , creating a complete list of all dce s would be prohibitive if not impossible . instead , we reason that , on a random surface , no two events will ever occur at exactly the same moment ( it is possible to artificially construct faceted surfaces such two or more events must occur simultaneously we do not consider this case ) . thus , if we simply refine our timestep when necessary , formerly overlapping events can be sorted out , and detected in sequence . a robust strategy for handling compound events is thus to ( a ) _ retrace _ the problematic timestep , ( b ) _ refine _ it into smaller slices , and ( c ) _ repeat _ steps ( a ) and ( b ) recursively , until only single events are detected .    * consistency . * since the surface is allowed to evolve unrepaired past numerous topological events per timestep , surface regions near these events will be geometrically inconsistent after the step . to say the same thing , facets involved in the bypassed events will have incorrect neighbor relationships . however , we have already classified all possible events , so having identified which event occurred , and which facets were involved , we know _ a priori _ what the correct neighbor relationships should be after the event . this knowledge , along with knowledge of the position of each facet involved , allows us to reconstruct the consistent surface that should have emerged during the event . unfortunately , not all events can be consistently corrected at a late time in this way . in particular , facet joins and joining facet pinches involve the joining of two facets that meet each other at a single local height . since this condition exists for only a single instant , such events can not be performed in a geometrically consistent way at any time other than the `` correct '' one . to accommodate this requirement while preserving a topology - independent timestep , we are forced to manually adjust the height of the joining facets before the event is performed . besides the error induced by this strategy ( discussed next ) , this need illustrates a second problem that can arise . in a * repair - induced inconsistency * , the very act of performing one event , because it is done late , triggers a second event that was not detected originally . an example is when the just - described height adjustment required for the delayed repair of a facet join triggers , say , a neighbor - switching event . since this newly - triggered event was not originally detected , the system is left in an inconsistent state after all repairs are made . an ad - hoc strategy to find such rii s is infeasible for the same reason as is a complete listing of all possible discrete compound events ( indeed , an rii may produce a dce , which rules out a simple multiple - rechecking strategy ) . thus , a similar retrace / refine / repeat strategy is required , with the added requirement that all events performed prior to detecting the rii must first be undone .    * accuracy . * finally , as alluded above , repairing topological events _ after _ they occur can introduce large isolated errors . this can be due to the `` fudging '' required for the delayed repair of facet joins and swaps , but more generally is caused by facets involved in ( uncorrected ) topological events having been evolved under the wrong equations of motion for part of the relevant timestep . consider an event @xmath35 , with domain of influence @xmath36 . since topological events likely correspond to a change in the surface s evolution equation , the facets in @xmath36 are moved using the wrong equations for the time interval @xmath37 $ ] . since the equations guiding @xmath36 are wrong by as much as @xmath33 for a time of order @xmath38 , facets in @xmath36 may accumulate @xmath39 location errors during the timestep in which the event occurs . since the quantity of topological events does not depend on @xmath40 , the method retains first order accuracy globally . however , this error introduces a barrier to achieving higher - order accuracy later on .      the previous method , alas , contains one subtle problem that keeps it from being a true @xmath32 method . this problem is that the frequency of dces and riis , though small , still scales with the system size , and these necessitate timestep refinement . so although the late method does not have to explicitly step according to the @xmath41 time between topological events , yet to accurately detect and resolve those events it is still implicitly driven by the refinement strategy to step along a time associated with dces and riis . while this characteristic time is longer than that between individual topological events , and does not greatly slow the simulation of tens of thousands of facets , it still results in a method that is formally @xmath34 , which becomes prohibitive when considering systems of millions of facets . thus , we now sketch a third method , not yet implemented , which eliminates this effect all together . in addition , the method allows us to perform topological events in a way which confers all the accuracy benefits of the first , predictive method . we first re - state that , on any given timestep , _ most _ facets are not involved in any topological changes . while it was therefore obviously wasteful to move the entire surface from event to event in the first method , it is also conceptually wasteful to perform a global retrace / refine / repeat step to dces and riis in the second method . instead , after every timestep , we should identify for each dce / rii the * topological subdomain * containing all facets involved in the event . the few facets within these subdomains would be retraced / refined / repeated as required , while the rest of the ( unaffected ) facets would be left undisturbed in their post - timestep state . since operating on a given , constant number of facets takes @xmath33 time , and since the number of events per timestep scales only like @xmath32 , we see that a single timestep and all associated corrections  including dces and riis  can now be performed in @xmath32 time , with a final state that is guaranteed to be consistent . this produces a true @xmath32 method . in addition , this `` localized replay '' strategy has an accuracy benefit . regular , recognized topological events also have easily identifiable topological subdomains . if the facets within these domains are retraced , then the predictive detection mechanism of the first method can be applied within the domain to eliminate consistency and accuracy problems associated with late removal . one difficulty remains , however . facets involved in topological events may , under configurational facet - velocity laws , exhibit abrupt changes in velocity a result of the event . during the remaining segment of timestep , these facets may `` break out '' of the subdomain initially created to contain them , and begin interacting with facets outside of it . thus , we would need a mechanism to detect this , and start over with a larger subdomain if it occurs . finally , if subdomains can change size , then there is the possibility that two nearby subdomains will come to overlap as the algorithm progresses . therefore , we must include the ability to merge them if necessary , start over with the new , larger sub - domain , and repeat adaptively until everything can be sorted . this adaptivity ensures the robustness of the method , as highlighted by the method s formal name of * adaptive localized replay*. the reader may note that the pattern of adaptive repetition is similar to that used to resolve dces and riis above , and worry that another , even smaller @xmath34 effect lurks in the shadows . however , in both of the previous methods , such effects were due to the _ global _ response to a _ local _ problem . since this latter method is designed to be localized , there is no longer any mechanism to generate such effects . we demonstrate our method using the sample dynamics derived in chapter 1 , associated with the directional solidification of a strongly anisotropic dilute binary alloy . when a sample is solidified at a pulling velocity which is greater than some critical value , solute gradients caused by solute rejection at the interface create a solute gradient which opposes and overcomes the thermal gradient , resulting in a negative effective thermal gradient . in this environment , facets move away from the freezing isotherm at a rate proportional to their mean distance from the isotherm , as given by the dynamics @xmath42    in figures  [ fig : threefold ] , [ fig : fourfold ] , and [ fig : sixfold ] , this dynamics is applied to surfaces with common three- , four- , and six - fold symmetries to illustrate the flexibility of our topology - handling approach . a series of snapshots from the coarsening surface are presented , in which surface configurations near to many of the topological events described above may be observed . ( however , neither the irregular neighbor switch , irregular facet pierce , nor facet pinch occur because no three facet normals are coplanar in these symmetries ; indeed , these events are not expected to occur on most physical surfaces , and were included for theoretical completeness . ) [ fig : threefold ]    about half of computational time is spent looking for topological changes , which is significant but not prohibitive . with appropriate timestep choice , using even the still - inefficient timestepping method 2 above , a surface of @xmath43 facets may be simulated to a @xmath44 percent coarsened state in about an hour on currently available workstations . with the implementation of method 3 above , this time should be cut in half , and since method 3 is truly @xmath32 , a single million - facet simulation should take about a day . looking further ahead , since facet velocity calculations and topology checks require only local information , the method should be easily parallelizable , making possible even larger speed gains . we have presented a complete method for the simulation of fully - faceted interfaces of a single bulk crystal , with arbitary symmetry , where an effective facet velocity law is known . the surface , which is reminiscent of two - dimensional cellular networks , is encoded numerically in a geometric three - component structure consisting of facets , edges , and junctions , and the neighbor relationships between them . consistent surface evolution specified by the facet velocity law is accomplished via a simple relationship between facet motion and junction motion . although requiring the explicit handling of topological events , the method is efficient , using the natural structure of the surface , and accessible , allowing easy extraction of geometrical data . this combination makes it ideal for the statistical study of extremely large surfaces necessary for the investigation of dynamic scaling phenomena . a comprehensive listing of all topological events has been presented . these allow single - crystal surface with arbitrary symmetry ( or no symmetry at all ) to be simulated . events are classified into three categories , representing three ways that surface elements can become geometrically inconsistent . these are : edges which approach zero length , facets which become constricted , and facets which approach zero area . resolution strategies for the former two classes can be determined a priori , while repairing surface `` holes '' left by vanishing facets requires a novel far - field reconnection algorithm , which iteratively searches through all virtual reconnections to find one which produces a consistent surface . finally , intrinsic non - uniqueness of several events is discussed ; since ours is a purely kinematic method , decisions regarding resolution of these events must be made ahead of time through consideration of the dynamics or other physics . in addition , a detailed discussion of the issues associated with a discrete time - stepping scheme has been presented . the core issue is that topological events , which occur at discrete times throughout surface evolution , invariably fall between timesteps , with consequences for the detection of events , as well as their geometrically consistent and numerically accurate resolution . since topological change corresponds ( under configurational facet velocity laws at least ) to qualitative changes in the local evolution function , some way to reach these in - between times must be introduced , while recognizing that only a few facets are involved in topological change during each timestep . a comparison of three approaches showed that the optimal solution is one of localized adaptive replay , where large timesteps are taken to improve speed , but local surface subdomains associated with topological change are reverted , and then replayed in a way that re - visits events with the necessary precision as necessary . while further work remains to implement this approach , the method as presented is capable of comparing million - facet datasets via averaged runs . our method of removing facets and facet groups requires patching a `` hole '' in the network left by the deleted facets . this requires selecting a geometrically consistent reconnection from a list of potential , or virtual reconnections . as outlined in the text , this involves searching through a complete list of virtual reconnections and testing each for geometric consistency . in this appendix , we address in more detail questions ( 1 - 3 ) posed in section  [ sec : vanishing - facets ] regarding the details of this method . for convenience , we repeat them here :    1 : :    how can we effectively characterize a `` reconnection '' ? 2 : :    how many potential reconnections are there to search ? 3 : :    how can we efficiently list all potential choices ?    we show here that an effective means of answer these questions is to think of reconnections as extended binary trees . this characterization enables us to easily count potential reconnections , distinguish them through naming , and suggests an algorithm for efficiently listing them for testing . an exhaustive illustration of the process is given for the case of an @xmath22 far field in figure  [ fig : binary tree listing ] . it will be useful to refer to that diagram during the following discussion . [ fig : binary tree listing ]      patching network holes always involves finding unknown neighbor relations between a given number of adjacent facets  that is , no facets are ever created , only edges and junctions . these are always connected into a single graph . in fact , the edges and junctions created during reconnection ( the `` reconnection set '' ) form a binary tree . in figure [ fig : binary tree listing ] , the trees associated with each possible reconnection are shown in thick blue lines . the far - field edges touching the reconnection set shown in gray represent the _ completion _ of this tree . that is , they take the interior tree , and add leaves to it so that every node of the interior tree is a triple - node . each virtual reconnection corresponds to a unique interior tree and completed tree in this manner . the counting of binary trees is , fortunately , a solved problem of graph theory . given @xmath8 nodes , they may be arranged in @xmath45 distinct binary trees , where @xmath45 is the @xmath46 _ catalan number _ ; @xmath47 now , re - connecting an @xmath23 far field requires the creation of @xmath48 edges and @xmath24 nodes ; this may be visually confirmed for the case @xmath49 in figure  [ fig : binary tree listing ] . this creates an @xmath24 noded binary tree , and so an @xmath23 far field has @xmath50 virtual reconnections to search . if take the completed binary tree and arbitrarily select a _ root node _ , then from each virtual interior tree we can generate a unique sequence of letters which identify it and encode its construction . this can be formed in one of two ways . the first way is to specify the tree by a set of recursive function calls . each branch point has left and right branches , each of which may terminate in either a leaf , or another branch point . the middle column of figure  [ fig : binary tree listing ] gives such a function for each tree shown in the left column . the second way is to walk around the tree in a counter - clockwise manner , recording each branch point or leaf as it is encountered . either method produces a series of letters that uniquely identify the tree . since the beginning lb and terminal ll are guaranteed , we may use only an abbreviated version consisting of @xmath48 of each letter . the problem is now reduced to generating all possible letter combinations . we can recursively build these combinations letter by letter using a greedy algorithm which chooses b over l if possible . this approach is subject to three restrictions which must be true of a `` legal '' word . at each step , ( a ) @xmath51 , ( b ) @xmath52 , ( c ) @xmath53 . the function we use is sufficiently short that we simply reproduce it here :    ....    list_trees(n ) {      rec_list_trees(n , 0 , 0 , '' ) ;    }      rec_list_trees(n , leaves , branches , word ) {      max = n-3 ;      if ( branches < max )         rec_list_trees(n , leaves , branches+1 , word+'b ' ) ;      if ( leaves < max and leaves < = branches )        rec_list_trees(n , leaves+1 , branches , word+'l ' ) ;      if ( leaves = = max and branches = = max )        print(word ) ;    } ....    thus , using this algorithm to generate a complete list of reconnection labels , we perform the reconnection associated with each one , and test it for geometric consistency . this allows us to efficiently find the correct reconnection . we have already mentioned that certain topological events are ambiguous in their resolution . here we review the instances of non - uniqueness , discuss their cause and implications , and suggest a method of treating them in a numerical scheme . we begin our list with an important ambiguity not discussed in the main text . as noted by thijssen @xcite , the lowly neighbor switch can be non - unique if the four facets involved have a `` saddle '' configuration  where the edges neighboring the vanishing edge ( the emanating edges ) form an alternating sequence of two valleys and two ridges . this is illustrated in figure  [ fig : non - uniqueness]a . there , from either starting position on the left , two topological resolutions are possible . one involves changing neighbor - relations , while the other does not . this latter resolution , which we term a `` neutral pass , '' represents a vanishing edge event which needs no resolution . however , it still results in a ( prohibited ) flipped edge , so if it is to actually occur , a bookkeeping operation must take place to correct this . moving on , we recall the non - unique `` gap opener '' flavor of irregular neighbor switch , which is not reproduced here . however , as a vanishing edge event , it may also come in the saddle variety , and admits a neutral - pass resolution option which is displayed in figure  [ fig : non - uniqueness]b . finally , the irregular facet pierce event is also not reproduced . none of these cases of ambiguity of resolution can be resolved at the kinematic level . since the particular evolution pathway leading to such ambiguities is the product of a long chain of mathematical reasoning , we therefore look backward in this chain to resolve them . the kinematics are most directly provided by the dynamics , which is a good first place to start . one option is to see which resolution is more strongly self - reinforcing ; if one choice under the given dynamics immediately works to reverse itself , for example , the other option should probably be chosen . moving farther back the chain of reasoning , one may consider the argument used to derive the given dynamics . for example , the dynamics ( [ eqn : solidification - dynamics ] ) comes from the constant reduction of an undercooling energy by moving away from the maximally - expensive @xmath6 isotherm . therefore , an energy - informed choice is to choose the resolution which minimizes this energy , i.e. , maximizes the total integrated distance from @xmath6 . taking another step back , perhaps such arguments come , as this one does , from a partial differential equation describing surface evolution . such equations can be simulated directly , and the resulting resolution choices studied . ultimately , the original physical model may have to be considered , perhaps at the atomic level . for each dynamics we wish to study , one must apply this chain of reasoning to find the correct ambiguity - resolution strategy . ideally , considerations at all levels should produce identical results . the non - uniqueness of particular topological events reflects a deeper , underlying problem . for each non - unique event , facet heights of competing resolutions are identical ; only neighbor relationships between these facets differ . thus , non - uniqueness in topological events indicates the presence of , and indeed is caused by , multiple possible ffr - style reconnections of a given group of far - field facets . what are the implications for the ffr algorithm of early facet removal ? while it may seem helpful at first to list prohibited resolution configurations and feed these to the ffr algorithm , this approach grows increasingly brittle as the number of prohibited configurations grows . instead , a more robust approach is to cause an ffr yielding multiple valid results to fail . having discovered resolution strategies for each individual event as described above , we simply let these rules apply until the far field is small enough to be unique ( similar to @xcite ) . a theory predicting when far fields will have multiple resolutions would aid in this process . finally , we note that the benefits of phase - field and level - set methods , which automatically capture topological change , are only clear if topological changes are unique . these methods are ultimately only kinematic , and offer no clear criteria for resolving kinematic non - uniqueness . thus , a dynamic selection criteria would seem to be required no matter the method used , and indeed , the implicit handling of topology offered by these methods may actually hinder the dynamic selection of kinematically ambiguous events .","The text discusses the development of a method for simulating the evolution of a crystal surface with a faceted structure, which is a common feature in crystal growth and other physical systems.

? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? hence the putative hot ( pre-)white dwarf would have to be in a wider orbit around the close eclipsing pair . @xcite recently derived a period of 4.91 d from time series photometry and spectroscopy of the eclipsing pair , and concluded that the centre - of - mass velocity of the central binary varies with time , based on different systemic velocities measured over the period from 1995 to 2001 . this suggests the presence of an unseen third orbiting body , which they concluded is a white dwarf of @xmath6 , and is the source of ionizing radiation for the pn shell . there is also a very bright b1ib star , sao  241302 ( hd 121228 ) , located 73 arcsec northeast of the nebula . @xcite speculated that this star is the ionizing source for suwt  2 . however , the relative strength of heii@xmath54686 in our spectra ( see later ) shows that the ionizing star must be very hot , @xmath7 @xmath8 100,000k , so the b1 star is definitively ruled out as the ionizing source . narrow - band h@xmath2+[nii ] and [ oiii]5007 images of suwt 2 obtained by @xcite show that the angular dimensions of the bright elliptical ring are about @xmath9arcsec@xmath10@xmath11arcsec at the 10% of maximum surface brightness isophote @xcite , and are used throughout this paper . @xcite used the mosaic2 camera on the cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) 4-m telescope to obtain a more detailed h@xmath2+[nii ] image , which hints that the ring is possibly the inner edge of a swept - up disc . the [ nii ] image also shows the bright ring structure and much fainter bipolar lobes extending perpendicular to the ring plane . we can see similar structure in the images taken by bond and exter in 1995 with the ctio 1.5 m telescope using an h@xmath2+[nii ] filter . fig.[suwt2:fig1 ] shows both narrow - band [ nii ] 6584 and h@xmath2 images taken in 1995 with the eso 3.6 m new technology telescope at the la silla paranal observatory using the eso multi - mode instrument ( emmi ) . the long - slit emission - line spectra also obtained with the emmi ( programme i d 074.d-0373 ) in 2005 revealed much more detail of the nebular morphology . the first spatio - kinematical model using the emmi long - slit data by @xcite suggested the existence of a bright torus with a systemic heliocentric radial velocity of @xmath12 kms@xmath13 encircling the waist of an extended bipolar nebular shell .    in this paper , we aim to uncover the properties of the hidden hot ionizing source in suwt  2 . we aim to do this by applying a self - consistent three - dimensional photoionization model using the mocassin 3d code by @xcite . in section  [ suwt2:sec : observations ] , we describe our optical integral field observations as well as the data reduction process and the corrections for interstellar extinction . in section [ suwt2:sec : kinematic ] , we describe the kinematics . in section  [ suwt2:sec : tempdens ] , we present our derived electron temperature and density , together with our empirical ionic abundances in section  [ suwt2:sec : abundances ] . in section  [ suwt2:sec : photoionization ] , we present derived ionizing source properties and distance from our self - consistent photoionization models , followed by a conclusion in section  [ suwt2:sec : conclusions ] . integral - field spectra of suwt  2 were obtained during two observing runs in 2009 may and 2012 august with the wide field spectrograph ( wifes ; * ?

[ suwt2:fig16 ] ( top left ) shows @xmath33 obtained for model 2 ( adopted best - fitting model ) constructed in @xmath34 cubic grids , and with the ionizing source being placed in the corner . it replicates the situation where the inner region has much higher @xmath33 in comparison to the ring @xmath33 as previously found by plasma diagnostics in  [ suwt2:sec : tempdens ] . in particular the mean values of @xmath32o  iii@xmath23 $ ] for the ring ( torus of the actual nebula ) and the inside ( spheroid ) regions are around @xmath35 and @xmath36k in all two models , respectively . they can be compared to the values of table  [ suwt2:tab : tenediagnostics ] that is @xmath32o  iii@xmath23=12\,300$]k ( ring ) and @xmath37k ( interior ) . although the average temperature of @xmath32n  ii@xmath23\simeq11\,700$]k over the entire nebula is higher than that given in table  [ suwt2:tab : tenediagnostics ] , the average temperature of @xmath32o  iii@xmath23\simeq13,000$]k is in decent agreement with that found by our plasma diagnostics . it can be seen in table  [ suwt2:tab : tenediagnostics ] that the temperatures for the two main regions of the nebula are very different , although we assumed a homogeneous elemental abundance distribution for the entire nebula relative to hydrogen . the temperature variations in the model can also be seen in fig . [ suwt2:fig16 ] . the gas density structure and the location of the ionizing source play a major role in heating the central regions , while the outer regions remain cooler as expected . overall , the average electron temperature of the entire nebula increases by increasing the helium abundance and decreasing the oxygen , carbon and nitrogen abundances , which are efficient coolants . we did not include any dust grains in our simulation , although we note that a large dust - to - gas ratio may play a role in the heating of the nebula via photoelectric emissions from the surface of grains . results for the fractional ionic abundances in the ring ( torus ) and inner ( oblate spheroid ) regions of our two models are shown in table  [ suwt2:tab : ionfraction ] and fig . [ suwt2:fig16 ] . it is clear from the figure and table that the ionization structures from the models vary through the nebula due to the complex density and radiation field distribution in the gas . as shown in table  [ suwt2:tab : ionfraction ] , he@xmath38/he is much higher in the inner regions , while he@xmath28/he is larger in the outer regions , as expected . similarly , we find that the higher ionization stages of each element are larger in the inner regions . from table [ suwt2:tab : ionfraction ] we see that hydrogen and helium are both fully ionized and neutrals are less than 8% by number in these best - fitting models . therefore , our assumption of @xmath39 is correct in our empirical method . table  [ suwt2:tab : ionratio ] lists the nebular average ionic abundance ratios calculated from the photoionization models . the values that our models predict for the helium ionic ratio are fairly comparable with those from the empirical methods given in  [ suwt2:sec : abundances ] , though there are a number of significant differences in other ions . the o@xmath40/h@xmath40 ionic abundance ratio is about 33 per cent lower , while o@xmath41/h@xmath40 is about 60% lower in model 2 than the empirical observational value . the empirical value of s@xmath28 differs by a factor of 8 compared to our result in model 2 , explained by the shock - excitation effects on the @xmath22s  ii@xmath23 $ ] @xmath266716,6731 doublet . additionally , the ne@xmath38/h@xmath40 ionic abundance ratio was underestimated by roughly 67% in model 2 compared to observed results , explained by the properties of the ionizing source . the ar@xmath42/h@xmath40 ionic abundance ratio in model 2 is 56% lower than the empirical results . other ionic fractions do not show major discrepancies ; differences remain below 35% . we note that the n@xmath28/n ratio is roughly equal to the o@xmath28/o ratio , similar to what is generally assumed in the @xmath43(n ) method . however , the ne@xmath38/ne ratio is nearly a factor of 2 larger than the o@xmath38/o ratio , in contrast to the general assumption for @xmath43(ne ) ( see equation  [ suwt2:eq_ne_cel1 ] ) . it has already been noted by @xcite that an alternative ionization correction method is necessary for correcting the unseen ionization stages for the neon abundance .      in fig . [ suwt2:fig15 ] we compared the values of the effective temperature @xmath44 and luminosity @xmath45 obtained from our two models listed in table  [ suwt2:tab : modelparameters ] to evolutionary tracks of hydrogen - burning and helium - burning models calculated by @xcite . we compared the post - agb age of these different models with the dynamical age of the ring found in [ suwt2:sec : kinematic ] . the kinematic analysis indicates that the nebula was ejected about 2340026300 yr ago . the post - agb age of the hydrogen - burning model ( left - hand panel in fig . [ suwt2:fig15 ] ) is considerably shorter than the nebula s age , suggesting that the helium - burning model ( vltp ; right - hand panel in fig . [ suwt2:fig15 ] ) may be favoured to explain the age . the physical parameters of the two a - type stars also yield a further constraint . the stellar evolutionary tracks of the rotating models for solar metallicity calculated by @xcite imply that the a - type stars , both with masses close to @xmath46 and @xmath47k , have ages of @xmath48  myr . we see that they are in the evolutionary phase of the `` blue hook '' ; a very short - lived phase just before the hertzsprung gap . interestingly , the initial mass of @xmath49 found for the ionizing source has the same age . as previously suggested by @xcite , the pn progenitor with an initial mass slightly greater than @xmath46 can be coeval with the a - type stars , and it recently left the agb phase . but , they adopted the system age of about 520  myr according to the y@xmath50 evolutionary tracks @xcite . the effective temperature and stellar luminosity obtained for both models correspond to the progenitor mass of @xmath49 . however , the strong nitrogen enrichment seen in the nebula is inconsistent with this initial mass , so another mixing process rather than the hot - bottom burning ( hbb ) occurs at substantially lower initial masses than the stellar evolutionary theory suggests for agb - phase @xcite . the stellar models developed by @xcite indicate that hbb occurs in intermediate - mass agb stars with the initial mass of @xmath51 for the metallicity of @xmath52 ; and @xmath53 for @xmath54@xmath55 . however , they found that a low - metallicity agb star ( @xmath56 ) with the progenitor mass of @xmath49 can also experience hbb . our determination of the argon abundance in suwt 2 ( see table[suwt2:tab : modelparameters ] ) indicates that it does not belong to the low - metallicity stellar population ; thus , another non - canonical mixing process made the abundance pattern of this pn . the stellar evolution also depends on the chemical composition of the progenitor , namely the helium content ( @xmath57 ) and the metallicity ( @xmath58 ) , as well as the efficiency of convection ( see e.g. * ? ? ? more helium increases the h - burning efficiency , and more metallicity makes the stellar structure fainter and cooler . any change in the outer layer convection affects the effective temperature . there are other non - canonical physical processes such as rotation , magnetic field and mass - loss during roche lobe overflow ( rlof ) in a binary system , which significantly affect stellar evolution . @xcite calculated a grid of stellar evolutionary tracks with rotation , and found that n / h at the surface in rotating models is higher than non - rotating models in the stellar evolutionary tracks until the end of the central hydrogen- and helium - burning phases prior to the agb stage . the modules for experiments in stellar astrophysics ( mesa ) code developed by @xcite indicates that an increase in the rotation rate ( or angular momentum ) enhances the mass - loss rate . the rotationally induced and magnetically induced mixing processes certainly influence the evolution of intermediate - mass stars , which need further studies by mesa . the mass - loss in a binary or even triple system is much more complicated than a single rotating star , and many non - canonical physical parameters are involved ( see e.g. binstar code by * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? @xcite used the cambridge stellar evolution ( stars ) code developed by @xcite to study numerically evolution of population i binaries , and produced a helium - rich outer layer . similarly , @xcite developed a helium white dwarf from a low mass progenitor in a close binary system . a helium enrichment in the our layer can considerably influence other elements through the helium - burning mixing process . in this paper we have analysed new optical integral - field spectroscopy of the pn suwt  2 to study detailed ionized gas properties , and to infer the properties of the unobserved hot ionizing source located in the centre of the nebula . the spatially resolved emission - line maps in the light of @xmath22n   ii@xmath23 $ ] @xmath56584 have described the kinematic structure of the ring . the previous kinematic model @xcite allowed us to estimate the nebula s age and large - scale kinematics in the galaxy . an empirical analysis of the emission line spectrum led to our initial determination of the ionization structure of the nebula . the plasma diagnostics revealed as expected that the inner region is hotter and more excited than the outer regions of the nebula , and is less dense . the ionic abundances of he , n , o , ne , s and ar were derived based on the empirical methods and adopted mean electron temperatures estimated from the observed @xmath22o  iii@xmath23 $ ] emission lines and electron densities from the observed @xmath22s  ii@xmath23 $ ] emission lines . we constructed photoionization models for the ring and interior of suwt  2 . this model consisted of a higher density torus ( the ring ) surrounding a low - density oblate spheroid ( the interior disc ) . we assumed a homogeneous abundance distribution consisting of eight abundant elements . the initial aim was to find a model that could reproduce the flux intensities , thermal balance structure and ionization structure as derived from by the observations . we incorporated nlte model atmospheres to model the ionizing flux of the central star . using a hydrogen - rich model atmosphere , we first fitted all the observed line fluxes , but the time - scale of the evolutionary track was not consistent with the nebula s age . subsequently , we decided to use hydrogen - deficient stellar atmospheres implying a vltp ( born - again scenario ) , and longer time - scales were likely to be in better agreement with the dynamical age of the nebula . although the results obtained by the two models of suwt  2 are in broad agreement with the observations , each model has slightly different chemical abundances and very different stellar parameters . we found a fairly good fit to a hydrogen - deficient central star with a mass of @xmath59 with an initial ( model ) mass of @xmath60 . the evolutionary track of @xcite implies that this central star has a post - agb age of about 25000 yr . interestingly , our kinematic analysis ( based on @xmath61 from * ? ? ? * ) implies a nebular true age of about 2340026300 yr . table  [ suwt2:tab : modelparameters ] lists two best - fitting photoionization models obtained for suwt  2 . the hydrogen - rich model atmosphere ( model 1 ) has a normal evolutionary path and yields a progenitor mass of @xmath49 , a dynamical age of 7,500 yr and nebular @xmath62 ( by number ) . the pg 1159 model atmosphere ( model 2 ) is the most probable solution , which can be explained by a vltp phase or born - again scenario : vltp @xmath63 [ wcl ] @xmath63 [ wce ] @xmath63 [ wc]-pg1159 @xmath63pg1159 @xcite . the pg1159 model yields @xmath64 and a stellar temperature of @xmath65 kk corresponding to the progenitor mass of @xmath49 and much longer evolutionary time - scale . the vltp can be characterized as the helium - burning model , but this can not purely explain the fast stellar winds ( @xmath66kms@xmath67 ) of typical [ wce ] stars . it is possible that an external mechanism such as the tidal force of a companion and mass transfer to an accretion disc , or the strong stellar magnetic field of a companion can trigger ( late ) thermal pulses during post - agb evolution . the abundance pattern of suwt  2 is representative of a nitrogen - rich pn , which is normally considered to be the product of a relatively massive progenitor star @xcite . recent work suggests that hbb , which enhances the helium and nitrogen , and decreases oxygen and carbon , occurs only for initial masses of @xmath685@xmath69 ( @xmath52 ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) ; hence , the nitrogen enrichment seen in the nebula appears to result from an additional mixing process active in stars down to a mass of 3@xmath69 . additional physical processes such as rotation increase the mass - loss rate @xcite and nitrogen abundance at the stellar surface ( end of the core h- and he - burning phases ; * ? ? ? the mass - loss via rlof in a binary ( or triple ) system can produce a helium - rich outer layer @xcite , which significantly affects other elements at the surface . ad warmly acknowledges the award of an international macquarie university research excellence scholarship ( imqres ) . qap acknowledges support from macquarie university and the australian astronomical observatory . we wish to thank nick wright and michael barlow for interesting discussions . we are grateful to david j. frew for the initial help and discussion . we thank anna v. kovacevic for carrying out the may 2009 2.3 m observing run , and lizette guzman - ramirez for assisting her with it . we also thank travis stenborg for assisting ad with the 2012 august 2.3 m observing run . ad thanks milorad stupar for his assistance in the reduction process . we would like to thank the staff at the anu siding spring observatory for their support , especially donna burton . this work was supported by the nci national facility at the anu . we would also like to thank an anonymous referee for helpful suggestions that greatly improved the paper . h.  e. , 2000 , in astronomical society of the pacific conference series , vol . 199 , asymmetrical planetary nebulae ii : from origins to microstructures , j.  h.  kastner , n.  soker , & s.  rappaport , ed . , p. 115 h.  e. , obrien m.  s. , sion e.  m. , mullan d.  j. , exter k. , pollacco d.  l. , webbink r.  f. , 2002 , in astronomical society of the pacific conference series , vol . 279 , exotic stars as challenges to evolution , c.  a.  tout & w.  van hamme , ed . , p. 239","**Summary of the Southern Planetary Nebula (Pnwt 2)**

The Southern Planetary Nebula (Pnwt 2) is an elliptical ring-shaped nebula with a central bright star. It is located in the constellation of Pegasus and is classified as an intermediate-excitation class (ec) object. The nebula is about 2 arcminutes in diameter and has a faint bipolar lobes extending perpendicularly to the ring.

**Observational Data**

The neb","the planetary nebula suwt  2 ( pn  g311.0 + 02.4 ) , is an unusual object with a prominent , inclined central emission ellipse and faint bipolar extensions . 
 it has two a - type stars in a proven binary system at the centre . 
 however , the radiation from these two central stars is too soft to ionize the surrounding material leading to a so far fruitless search for the responsible ionizing source . such a source is clearly required and has already been inferred to exist via an observed temporal variation of the centre - of - mass velocity of the a - type stars . 
 moreover , the ejected nebula is nitrogen - rich which raises question about the mass - loss process from a likely intermediate - mass progenitor . 
 we use optical integral - field spectroscopy to study the emission lines of the inner nebula ring . 
 this has enabled us to perform an empirical analysis of the optical collisionally excited lines , together with a fully three - dimensional photoionization modelling . 
 our empirical results are used to constrain the photoionization models , which determine the evolutionary stage of the responsible ionizing source and its likely progenitor . 
 the time - scale for the evolutionary track of a hydrogen - rich model atmosphere is inconsistent with the dynamical age obtained for the ring . 
 this suggests that the central star has undergone a very late thermal pulse . 
 we conclude that the ionizing star could be hydrogen - deficient and compatible with what is known as a pg 1159-type star . 
 the evolutionary tracks for the very late thermal pulse models imply a central star mass of @xmath0 , which originated from a @xmath1 progenitor . 
 the evolutionary time - scales suggest that the central star left the asymptotic giant branch about 25,000 years ago , which is consistent with the nebula s age .

"general relativity ( gr ) as a theory that describes the geometrical structure of space - time and its connection with the energy content of the universe has been highly successful in the last one hundred years . gr is not only able to give explanation of some discrepancies that had been arisen with newtonian theory in the solar system , but also provides a satisfactory description of the cosmological evolution of the space - time . however , gr is not able to account for the latest cosmological and astrophysical observations with standard matter sources . among these observations are the anomalous rotational velocities of objects near the edge of the galaxies , the dynamics of galaxies in clusters , formation of large scale structures or gravitational lensing of background objects by galaxy clusters , such as the bullet cluster . for the explanation of these observations , more matter than the standard one is required , the so - called dark matter ( dm ) which has an attractive gravitational character that decelerates the expansion of the universe . although there are many plausible origins for this component @xcite , dm is usually assumed to be in the form of thermal relics that naturally freeze - out with the right abundance in many extensions of the standard model of particles @xcite . future experiments will be able to discriminate among the large number of candidates and models , such as direct and indirect detection designed explicitly for their search @xcite , or even at high energy colliders , where they could be produced @xcite . furthermore , the authors of @xcite , recently awarded with the nobel prize in physics , discovered the accelerated expansion of the universe . this result has been one of the main reasons for the revision of the cosmological evolution as predicted by gr . neither the properties of usual matter and energy nor the believed properties of dm can account for this acceleration . one way of circumventing this problem is to postulating a new kind of fluid , the so - called dark energy , which has a non - standard equation of state allowing a positive energy density while having a negative pressure @xcite . another possibility to generate the present accelerated expansion of the universe is by the modification of gr @xcite . indeed , this type of modifications could produce an inflationary epoch in the very early universe . this epoch is postulated to evade the problems with the initially homogeneous and isotropic state of the universe which arise from considering particle horizons in robertson - walker cosmological models .    in this work , we will analyze the accelerated expansion of the universe by its description through its effects on a congruence of geodesics without assuming any specific gravitational theory . this description has the advantage of being coordinate - independent . in an accelerated expansion it is expected that neighboring geodesics with similar direction will increasingly recede from each other . this evolution may be studied either through the geodesic deviation equation @xcite or alternatively by the definition of a kinematic quantity , the expansion , which is quite analogous to the spatial divergence of a vector field . the expansion rate along the congruence will provide us with the appropriate tool to analyze the consequences of the cosmological accelerated expansion of the universe . this rate is given by the raychaudhuri equation ( re ) , which will be discussed and used throughout this work . re was first derived by raychaudhuri in @xcite for congruences of timelike geodesics . later , sachs @xcite introduced the corresponding re for null geodesics . et al . _ @xcite provided a generalization of hydrodynamics to gr where results analogous to well - known theorems of hydrodynamics using re equation were obtained . given a congruence of timelike or null geodesics this equation provides the contraction or expansion rate of the congruence according to some kinematic properties of the congruence and the curvature of the space - time where the congruence is embedded . in gr , the re together with assumed energy conditions guarantee the attractive character of gravity represented by a non - positive contribution to this equation from the space - time geometry . furthermore , the re has a fundamental role in the demonstration of important theorems due to hawking and penrose . these theorems assert that singularities of manifolds representing physical space - times are intrinsic to gr and not a special property of particular solutions of einstein s equations provided that some energy conditions hold @xcite .    in this investigation , we shall analyze the evolution of the expansion of a congruence of geodesics . this is carried out in a robertson - walker cosmological model from a kinematical point of view since no gravitational theory is assumed beyond the equivalence principle . this work is organized as follows : first , in section [ raychaudhuriequation ] , we present a short review of the derivation of the re for illustrative purposes and stress some aspects usually disregarded in the available literature . then , the kinematics of a congruence of geodesics in a robertson - walker space - time is studied in section [ rwspace - times ] . we conclude the paper by giving our conclusions in section [ conclusions ] . the re provides the expansion rate of a congruence of timelike or null geodesics . in the following , we will summarize the main results for both cases separately according to the notation in @xcite . for different reviews and approaches to the re , we refer the reader to @xcite . in the following let us use abstract index notation ( see @xcite for details ) . thus , an expression like @xmath0 represents the vector itself and not a component in a certain basis . an expression like @xmath1 must be understood as @xmath2 . when explicit mention to the components of a tensor in a certain basis is made , greek indices will be used , i.e. ,  @xmath3 . the principal advantage of this notation is that it distinguishes equations that hold between tensors and equations that only hold for components in a certain basis . we use a metric signature ( @xmath4 ) and the riemann and ricci tensors and the ricci scalar are defined respectively as @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 . let us consider a congruence of timelike geodesics and its tangent vector field @xmath0 . it is assumed that the tangent vector field is normalized , i.e. ,  @xmath8 , which is always feasible by choosing an affine parameterization of the congruence . let us define the ( 0,2 ) tensor @xmath9 it is easy to verify that @xmath10 the first expression is a consequence of @xmath0 being normalized whereas the second one is the geodesic equation . as usual the projector tensor @xmath11 is defined by @xmath12 this is a spatial metric provided that @xmath0 is hypersurface orthogonal . this property of the vector field means that there exists a foliation of the manifold by hypersurfaces orthogonal to @xmath0 . the metric induced by @xmath13 on these hypersurfaces is @xmath11 . for cases where an orthogonal hypersurface can not be found , the projector tensor @xmath11 is still well - defined as the tensor that projects tensors in a subspace orthogonal to @xmath0 at each point of the manifold . it is worth noticing that @xmath14 has no components in the direction of @xmath0 according to expression . consequently , @xmath14 is rather defined in the subspace orthogonal to @xmath0 . this subspace is the hypersurfaces tangent space foliating the manifold when @xmath0 is hypersurface orthogonal . finally , let us consider the following quantities @xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath17}\,;\end{aligned}\ ] ] which are the trace ( with respect to the metric @xmath11 , but the trace is the same respect to @xmath13 because of ) , the trace - free symmetric part and the antisymmetric part of @xmath14 respectively . these quantities are known as the expansion @xmath18 , shear @xmath19 and twist @xmath20 of the congruence . thus , @xmath14 can be decomposed as @xmath21 which is analogous to the decomposition of the deformation velocity tensor in hydrodynamics . the meaning of @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 is clear from the analogy with hydrodynamics . the expansion @xmath18 takes into account the divergence or convergence of nearby geodesics . it may also be interpreted as a relative change in volume of a fluid particle . the shear @xmath19 provides information about the deformation of the geodesic congruence without change in volume . finally , the twist @xmath20 contains the vorticity of the congruence . equations for the rate of these kinematic quantities along each geodesic can be derived in the following way . after some calculus , it can be proved @xmath22 where the leibniz s rule and the geodesic equation satisfied by @xmath0 have been used . since we are interested in the equation for the expansion @xmath18 , the trace of becomes @xmath23 where @xmath24 is an affine parameter of the geodesics , i.e. , the proper time of an observer moving along a geodesic of the congruence . equation is known as the re @xcite . let us recall that the expansion @xmath18 provides a natural coordinate - independent way of measuring the focusing or divergence of free - falling matter following a certain congruence of geodesics in the gravitational field , i.e. , @xmath25 means divergence and @xmath26 means convergence . the quantities of the r.h.s .  of are scalars , thus any convenient coordinate system can be used to calculate them . however , it is important to stress that equation provides the expansion rate as seen by an observer moving along a geodesic of the congruence . the equivalent counterparts for shear @xmath19 and the twist @xmath20 are obtained from equation by taking the trace - free symmetric part and the antisymmetric part respectively . let us now discuss the character of the contribution of the different terms in expression . the quantities @xmath27 and @xmath28 are non - negative quadratic scalars . the fact that these scalars are non - negative is due to the _ spatial _ character of the tensor @xmath14 reflected by . this can be understood if one considers a framework with the spatial components of @xmath11 , i.e. ,  the orthogonal components to @xmath0 , taking the values @xmath29 with @xmath30 at a certain point of the manifold , whereas the components in the direction of @xmath0 being zero . then , taking into account the spatial character of @xmath14 the values of @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the same in this special framework . therefore , @xmath33 . the same reasoning is valid for @xmath20 . thus , it is clear that both the shear @xmath19 and the expansion @xmath18 always tend the congruence to focus whereas the twist @xmath20 always tends to make it diverge . for the contribution of space - time geometry , i.e. , for the sign of @xmath34 , there appear three possibilities : @xmath35 @xmath36 @xmath37 the implications of the last three inequalities will be the keystone of this investigation . the effect that the two first possibilities produce in the congruence may be expressed as a tendency to diverge and a tendency to focus respectively . it can also be understood as accelerated expansion in the case of and decelerated expansion in the case of . on the other hand , the value of @xmath38 depends both on the point of the manifold where it is calculated and on the direction of the vector field @xmath0 at that point . thus , a positive contribution to the re may be obtained at some points of the manifold for certain directions whereas may be negative at those points for different directions . although it is rarely considered , the expression @xmath39 admits a geometrical interpretation @xcite . let @xmath40 be a unit vector and @xmath41 with @xmath42 an arbitrary set of unit vectors orthogonal to @xmath40 . the gaussian curvature @xmath43 of the geodesic surface generated by @xmath40 and @xmath41 is @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the usual eisenhart @xmath47 s which take the values @xmath48 or @xmath49 according to @xmath50 and @xmath51 . as is widely known , the sign convention for riemann and ricci tensors is arbitrary a priori . however , let us recall that the sign of the gaussian curvature possesses an intrinsic meaning sign - convention independent . thus , when all these gaussian curvatures @xmath43 are summed one gets @xmath52 where we have considered that @xmath53 is zero and the spectral decomposition of the metric @xmath54 has been used . manifestly , the sum does not depend on the election of the set of orthogonal unit vectors @xmath41 under consideration . then , @xmath55 is the sum of all the gaussian curvatures of the geodesics surfaces generated by @xmath0 and any set of orthogonal unit vectors to it . this has been referred to as the mean curvature in the direction of @xmath0@xcite . thus , by following our sign convention @xmath56 and the mean curvature @xmath57 in the direction of a timelike vector @xmath0 becomes @xmath58 hence , the contribution of the space - time geometry to the re has a clear geometrical interpretation as the mean curvature @xmath57 in the direction of the tangent vector field @xmath0 . furthermore , the inequalities , and can be rewritten in terms of the mean curvature @xmath57 in the direction of @xmath0 as follows @xmath59 @xmath60 @xmath61 thus , if the mean curvature for a given timelike vector @xmath0 at one point of the manifold is positive ( negative ) the space - time geometry would tend to make geodesics with tangent vector @xmath0 passing through this point diverge ( focus ) . this formulation represents a clear advantage over the previous one in terms of @xmath38 since it does not depend upon any sign convention nor upon the metric signature . let us recall that when energy conditions are assumed in gr , one always obtains and but not . the fact that in gr @xmath57 is always negative or zero is interpreted as a manifestation of the attractive character of gravity . let us return to our discussion about the re . it is clear that the sign of the expansion rate @xmath62 will depend upon all the contributions of the r.h.s of . from their respectively definitions , it is obvious that all these terms depend on the congruence of geodesics under consideration . however , the terms @xmath63 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 depend on the behavior of the congruence in the neighborhood of the point where they are calculated . let us recall that these terms come from @xmath64 , then the tangent vector field @xmath0 must be known locally in order to calculate its covariant derivative . nevertheless , the contribution of space - time geometry @xmath57 depends only upon the direction of the congruence at a given point . thus , all the congruences pointing in the same direction at a given point , will have the same contribution from space - time . moreover , there are only two terms that may have a positive contribution : the term @xmath28 and the one given by @xmath57 . specifically , we shall restrict ourselves to congruences with @xmath65 as we shall explain at the end of this section . therefore , in this type of congruences the only term that may have a positive contribution to is @xmath57 .      an equivalent version of the re for null geodesics can be obtained by considering the null tangent vector field @xmath66 to a congruence of null geodesics @xcite . as expected the result is @xmath67 where the quantities @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 are defined with respect to the congruence of null geodesics , the tensor @xmath71 is the tensor analogous to @xmath11 for null geodesics and @xmath72 is an affine parameter in the following sense . when null geodesics are considered the tangent vector field has always zero norm and consequently an affine parameter defined as the one which normalizes the tangent vector field does not hold . for this reason , an affine parameter can be defined in a more general way as the one preserving the geodesic equation in its usual form . this definition remains valid both for timelike and null geodesics . the factor @xmath73 in instead of @xmath74 appearing in is due to the fact that the involved subspace in the case of null geodesics is two - dimensional rather than three - dimensional . thus , equation is the re for null geodesics .    finally , let us remind that the same type of space - time geometry contributions provided by the inequalitites , and applies replacing @xmath39 by @xmath75 . however , an analogous interpretation of the term @xmath75 as a mean curvature is not practicable in this case @xcite .      at this stage , we estimate important to stress that the raychaudhuri equations and are identities , i.e. , geometrical statements which do not require any underlying gravitational theory to be derived . they are quite general and apply whenever a riemannian geometry for the space - time is assumed .    a more general equation for the evolution of the expansion of a congruence results if the assumption of being a congruence of geodesics is discarded . moreover , the re can be generalized to spaces with torsion @xcite . for our purposes and are sufficient . as was briefly mentioned , there are analogous equations to and for the shear @xmath19(@xmath68 ) and twist @xmath20(@xmath69 ) that provide the rate of these quantities along geodesics . these equations form a coupled system of non - linear first order differential equations . they also receive the generic name of raychaudhuri equations . for instance , the equation for the twist @xmath20 is an homogeneous differential equation in @xmath20 and thus if @xmath20 is zero initially it will remain zero along the geodesics . this result does not prove that the unique solution is @xmath65 because of the non - linearity of the equation . however , this conclusion can be eventually proved more rigorously ( see @xcite ) . this is in fact the analogous result to kelvin s theorem in hydrodynamics showing the analogy between theorems of hydrodynamics and theorems concerning congruences of geodesics @xcite . the initial value problem of raychaudhuri equations is still an open question . however , in the case of equation if congruences that satisfy @xmath65 are considered , there would exist hypersurfaces orthogonal to the vector field that foliate the space - time . this is a consequence of frobenius theorem @xcite . therefore , for a normalized vector field defined orthogonally to an arbitrary hypersurface  not necessarily in the whole manifold its shear and its expansion ( with components only in that hypersurface ) can be determined . this way , the expansion rate of the congruence of geodesics defined by this vector field can also be determined . therefore , the rate of the kinematic quantities of the congruence ( @xmath18 , @xmath20 and @xmath19 for timelike geodesics and @xmath70 , @xmath69 and @xmath68 for null geodesics ) is influenced by the geometry of space - time . in particular , in the case of expansion @xmath18 ( @xmath70 ) , the term @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) is the contribution of space - time geometry for timelike geodesics ( null geodesics ) . let us recall that the contribution of space - time geometry has more general implications than the other contributions since the former depends solely on the direction of the tangent vector field at one point but not on the local behavior of the tangent vector field as @xmath18 ( @xmath70 ) , @xmath19 ( @xmath68 ) and @xmath20 ( @xmath69 ) . thus , the contribution of space - time at one point of the manifold is the same for every congruence of geodesics with the same value of the tangent vector field at that point . however , the quantities @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 will be different if the congruences are not locally the same .    finally , let us remind here that the field equations derived from the assumed gravitational theory determine the geometry of the space - time . for instance , in the case of gr , the usual einstein s field equations enable to relate the quantities @xmath39 and @xmath78 which appear in and respectively with the energy - momentum tensor @xmath79 in a very simple way . hence , the expansion rate is straightforwardly related with the energy - momentum content . as a result , general properties of the behavior of the geodesic congruence can be established provided that some energy conditions on the energy - momentum tensor are assumed @xcite . more precisely , if the strong energy condition and the null energy condition are assumed ( although the last one also follows by continuity if the strong energy condition holds ) one reaches _ the geodesic focusing theorem _ , which assures the convergence until zero size of a congruence of geodesics without vorticity which is initially focusing . this result is used in the demonstration of the singularity theorems by hawking and penrose and it has recently drawn wide attention due to its prominent role in the holographic principle @xcite . in this section , let us start by considering a spatially flat robertson - walker metric @xcite , @xmath80 that according to the ultimate measurements of cosmological densities of the universe @xcite , represents correctly the universe at sufficiently large scales in agreement with the hypotheses of homogeneity and isotropy stated in the cosmological principle . the connection between the inequality  or equivalently  with the accelerated expansion of the universe is not straightforward . the accelerated expansion of the universe in a robertson - walker cosmological model is governed by the condition @xmath81 where the derivatives are taken with respect to cosmic time . however , provided that the inequality holds for all the timelike directions @xmath0 in a region of the manifold , the contribution of space - time geometry then favors a tendency to diverge of all the congruence of geodesics in that region . therefore , the natural question that arises is whether the condition @xmath81 , when satisfied in a region , implies @xmath82 for every timelike direction @xmath0 . this question will be addressed throughout the present section . one may thus wonder about the effects of the cosmological acceleration in the kinematical behavior of a congruence of timelike geodesics . in particular , it is of special interest to study whether a congruence of timelike geodesics tends to focus  or to diverge  and under which conditions this happens . the kinematic quantity of a congruence known as expansion @xmath18 introduced in section [ raychaudhuriequation ] provides us with a useful tool to study the focusing of timelike geodesics . in this sense , the inequality @xmath83 states the tendency of nearby geodesics to diverge measured by a comoving observer . the proper time @xmath24 is the time of the comoving observer . since the l.h.s .  of the previous expression can be replaced by the r.h.s .  of the re , a vector field tangent to a congruence of timelike geodesics must be chosen in order to determine the expansion @xmath18 , shear @xmath19 and twist @xmath20 . since we are dealing with a robertson - walker metric , the most natural choice for a vector field would be @xmath84 which is the preferred direction of a robertson - walker space - time because of the local isotropy in hypersurfaces orthogonal to @xmath85 . the vector field gives rise to a congruence of timelike geodesics of the form @xmath86 in comoving coordinates with @xmath87 and @xmath88 constants . these geodesics are followed by the fundamental observers , those seeing homogeneity and isotropy in constant - time hypersurfaces . thus , a fundamental congruence refers to the congruence of timelike geodesics generated by @xmath85 . as it is easy to verify by straightforward calculation  or by using symmetry arguments , the kinematic quantities of the fundamental congruence are all zero except the expansion @xmath89 thus , by inspection of it follows that the rate of the expansion seen by a fundamental observer will be entirely determined by the value of the expansion @xmath90 and the contribution of space - time geometry @xmath91 hence @xmath92 , \label{dtexpansionrw}\end{aligned}\ ] ] where the proper time of the fundamental observer is @xmath93 , i.e. ,  the time coordinate in . a fundamental observer will then see nearby geodesics with a tendency to diverge if and only if @xmath94 . by imposing this condition on we get @xmath95 which can be expressed in the following way @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the deceleration parameter and @xmath98 is the hubble parameter . hence , a fundamental observer will perceive nearby geodesics with a tendency to diverge if and only if @xmath99 . in other words , getting a deceleration parameter smaller than zero is not sufficient for fundamental timelike geodesics to be perceived by a fundamental observer as diverging in an increasingly fashion .    in the standard cosmological model @xmath100 , the value of @xmath97 today can be determined by using the values of the present relative abundances of matter ( including dark matter ) and cosmological constant , @xmath101 and @xmath102 respectively by the expression @xmath103 where flatness in spatial sections was again assumed . thus , using the approximate values @xmath104 and @xmath105 given in @xcite , the present value of the deceleration parameter @xmath106 results @xmath107 , with an uncertainty of the order of @xmath108 . this value of @xmath106 does not imply a tendency of nearby geodesics to diverge since @xmath109 . one may argue that we have assumed gr to calculate the deceleration parameter @xmath106 , and therefore the discussion is not independent of a gravitational theory . however , there are straightforward estimations of the deceleration parameter using supernovae ia @xcite without appealing to a gravitational theory . the preferred values obtained for @xmath106 in these analyses are always larger than @xmath49 , although with uncertainties of the order @xmath110 .    before continuing with the study of the kinematics of a congruence of timelike geodesics , let us mention that in general , the determination of other geodesics is not possible in a closed form since an expression for @xmath111 is usually missing . therefore , it will not be possible in general to obtain an expression for the tangent vector field @xmath0 of a congruence of geodesics . however , if our interest is focused on calculating the space - time geometry contribution to the re for timelike geodesics , the knowledge of the vector field @xmath112 expression is not necessary . the reason is that the value of @xmath57 only depends on the direction of the vector field at a given point . then , given a timelike vector , the value of @xmath57 can be determined by using the expressions for the components of the ricci tensor . moreover , the value of @xmath57 will be constant in each hypersurface orthogonal to @xmath85 because of homogeneity in these hypersurfaces . however , if we wish to know the total value of @xmath113 from the re , an expression for the tangent vector field is needed . it means that we must know the vector field locally at each point of the manifold . nevertheless , we can use the property stated in equations which asserts the _ spatial _ character of @xmath114 . the procedure consists on defining a smooth vector field on a spacelike hypersurface . the only conditions on the definition of this vector field are that it be normalized @xmath8 and that it be orthogonal to the hypersurface where it is defined . this slice of a vector field will give rise to a congruence of timelike geodesics passing by the hypersurface with the direction of the vector field in each point . this congruence will have @xmath65 because being zero in the initial hypersurface it will remain so . however , the shear @xmath19 and the expansion @xmath18 do not need to be zero . then , instead of considering a vector field tangent to a congruence of geodesics defined in all the manifold , a vector field is instead defined at a spacelike hypersurface . let us remark that this procedure restricts us to consider congruences of timelike geodesics without vorticity . by this way @xmath14 at the initial hypersurface can be determined . thus , the expansion rate @xmath113 of the congruence evaluated in the hypersurface will be known from a slice of the geodesic tangent vector field . the congruences under consideration from now on are obtained from a one - parameter dependent slice of a vector field . first of all , we must choose a spacelike hypersurface where the vector field will be defined . the simplest one - parameter dependent @xmath115 family of spacelike hypersurfaces defined by a function @xmath116 in terms of the coordinates is @xmath117 where @xmath118 in order the hypersurfaces to be spacelike . this constraint is easily understood if one considers the normal vector to the hypersurfaces and this vector is then constrained to be timelike . this family of hypersurfaces depends in fact on three parameters , namely the three components of @xmath119 . however , thanks to the spatial isotropy , the direction of @xmath119 does not affect the results . thus , the relevant parameter is @xmath120 . moreover , because of spatial homogeneity and the arbitrariness in the election of the time origin we have eliminated the constant that may appear in , i.e. ,  the hypersurfaces pass through the origin of coordinates . the above restriction on the value of @xmath115 means that the hypersurface is defined only in the manifold region @xmath121 . otherwise , the hypersurfaces are not spacelike . let us now define the following quantity @xmath122 the slice of the timelike vector field which is normalized and orthogonal to the hypersurface given by then becomes @xmath123 where @xmath124 the tangent vector field that gives rise to the fundamental congruence is obtained in the specific case @xmath125 or equivalently @xmath126 . in order to guarantee @xmath127 to be timelike , one imposes @xmath128 . then , it follows the restriction on the value of @xmath115 commented above . from , @xmath129 can be interpreted as the spatial coordinate velocity of a particle passing through the hypersurfaces defined by . the dependence of @xmath129 on the scale factor @xmath130 means that this velocity is not the same in the whole hypersurface defined by a certain value of the parameter @xmath115 . note that in expression we have chosen the @xmath131-axis in the direction of the spatial coordinate velocity @xmath129 without loss of generality thanks to the spatial isotropy . the @xmath132 factor just ensures the normalization @xmath133 . one realizes of the similarity of the former derivation with the usual definitions of @xmath129 and @xmath134 in special relativity . consequently , the slice of the timelike vector field orthogonal to the hypersurfaces in special relativity becomes @xmath135 with @xmath136 in order to guarantee @xmath137 , with @xmath138 the minkowskian metric . hence , expressions and are completely valid both in special relativity ( setting @xmath139 ) and in robertson - walker space - times . however , when we are considering a robertson - walker metric , the maximum coordinate velocity @xmath140 that a physical entity can reach , in the sense that it moves along null geodesics , depends on the value of scale factor @xmath111 at each point . in order to guarantee that the vector field as given by is timelike , the required condition reads @xmath141 . therefore the maximum coordinate velocity is expressed as @xmath142 . nevertheless , let us recall that the physical spatial velocity which is measured is @xmath143 . one may interpret a physical velocity as the ratio between a _ spatial _ and _ time _ distances . these distances hold for the ones induced by the timelike geodesic one follows . therefore , for a particle with four - velocity @xmath127 , its physical velocity yields @xmath144 where @xmath145 is given by and @xmath146 is the spatial metric induced by the flow of time in the direction of @xmath147 . alternatively , one may also build a unit vector orthogonal to @xmath147 being the spatial projection of @xmath127 , namely @xmath148 , and then calculate the ratio between the projection of @xmath127 in the direction of @xmath149 and in the direction of @xmath147 , finally obtaining the same result as in . therefore , after considering the slice of the timelike vector field @xmath127 defined in the hypersurface , the tensor @xmath114 is calculated in order to obtain both the expansion @xmath18 and the shear @xmath19 ( the twist @xmath20 is zero by construction ) . by following this procedure , the value of @xmath113 in the hypersurfaces @xmath150 will be determined . this will provide us with information about the focusing or divergence of the congruence generated by the vector field slice in terms of the scale factor @xmath111 , its derivatives and the spatial coordinate velocity @xmath129 . however , in the following we shall focus on the mean curvature @xmath57 . this is due to the fact that although @xmath19 and @xmath18 may not be zero , their contribution to the re is always non - positive . moreover , as stressed in section [ raychaudhuriequation ] , the implications of the mean curvature @xmath57 are more general than those of the other terms . furthermore , @xmath57 is the unique term that may have a positive contribution to the re since for the congruence given rise by the vector field slice we have @xmath151 . hence , let us proceed with the calculation of @xmath152 in order to extract information about the focusing of these one - parameter dependent congruences .      in the following we will obtain a condition on @xmath111 and the spatial coordinate velocity @xmath129 that guarantees @xmath153 , i.e. , a positive contribution to the re . the motivation of choosing a positive contribution lies in the fact that the fundamental congruence satisfies @xmath154 in the present epoch as follows from . then , by using the ricci tensor components derived from the metric and the expression for the timelike vector field slice given in , we get @xmath155\ , . \ ] ] thus , imposing @xmath156 , yields @xmath157 where @xmath158 ( because of @xmath159 ) have been used . this last inequality tells us that the condition @xmath81 is not sufficient for a timelike vector of the form to get a positive contribution to the re from the space - time geometry @xmath152 . consequently , @xmath160 must be larger than a certain positive value . therefore , a positive contribution to the re from space - time geometry for all timelike congruences is not equivalent to @xmath161 . the inequality can be recast as @xmath162 which depends only on the physical velocity @xmath143 . in figure [ fig : qbeta ] , the condition has been depicted . in that figure , the values @xmath163 ensuring a positive contribution to the re from the mean curvature are plotted . moreover , it is worthwhile to stress that the requirement @xmath164 implies lower values of the deceleration parameter @xmath97 for timelike vectors approaching the null cone . then , in the limit @xmath165 , i.e. ,  timelike vectors near the null cone , we get @xmath99 . therefore , provided that @xmath99 all the congruences of timelike geodesics will have a positive contribution to the re from space - time geometry which means @xmath153 for all timelike vectors @xmath127 . the implication of this condition must not be confused with : the condition implied @xmath94 for the fundamental congruence whereas in this case the condition @xmath99 implies a positive contribution from the space - time geometry , namely @xmath153 , for every congruence of timelike geodesics . since the present value of the deceleration parameter is not smaller than @xmath49 , it remains possible to get @xmath166 for timelike congruences whose tangent vector field is sufficiently inclined with respect to @xmath167 . therefore , using , the following possibilities for the physical velocity @xmath143 may be fulfilled @xmath168 @xmath169 @xmath170 to the re from the space - time geometry . if @xmath126 in we obtain @xmath81 which means that the fundamental congruence will experience a positive contribution from the space - time if @xmath81 and therefore in agreement with .    in figure [ fig : nullcone ] , a future light cone is represented . using the value for the present deceleration parameter ( @xmath107 ) , the limiting value obtained from , @xmath171 separates the regions of different contribution to the re . the requirement @xmath172 constitutes a necessary condition to ensure @xmath173 . however , due to the non - positive character of all the other terms of the re for a congruence without vorticity , @xmath113 might be negative despite a positive contribution @xmath174 . let us recall that a value of the deceleration parameter @xmath97 equals to @xmath49 is obtained for @xmath175 which is the solution in robertson - walker cosmological model of the einstein s equations with cosmological constant @xmath176 in vacuum . this solution is usually referred as the de sitter expanding universe . this means that a value of @xmath97 lower than @xmath49 implies an expansion rate higher than the rate of expansion of a de sitter solution . therefore , it seems very unlikely to have @xmath177 in any epoch of the evolution of the universe . let us recall that even in the inflation phase the rate of expansion is expected to be exponential and therefore @xmath178 . thus , let us conclude this section by remarking that for timelike vectors sufficiently close to the light cone one obtains @xmath173 in any epoch of the evolution of the universe . in this investigation we have studied the re and its implications on the evolution of geodesics . we addressed the kinematics of a congruence of timelike geodesics without vorticity in a robertson - walker cosmological model with no underlying gravitational theory assumed a priori . from a general point of view , we have established the difference between the implications of a cosmic acceleration @xmath81 and a positive contribution to the re from the space - time geometry , i.e.  @xmath179 . we have then considered the fundamental congruence generated by the vector field @xmath180 . we proved that the tendency to focus or diverge for the fundamental congruence depends of the fact that @xmath97 is either bigger or smaller than @xmath49 respectively . given the fact that an approximate value for the deceleration parameter today @xmath107 can be found either by assuming gr or just by using supernovae ia data in theory - independent calculations , one concludes that although the fundamental congruence is expanding because of @xmath181 , it has a tendency to focus since @xmath182 . moreover , we have examined the congruence of timelike geodesics generated by a vector field orthogonal to a one - parameter @xmath115 dependent spacelike hypersurface . the spatial coordinate velocity @xmath183 represented  at each point of the hypersurface  the inclination of the vector field with respect to the preferred direction of robertson - walker models @xmath147 . in the case of the slice of a vector field to be normalized and orthogonal to the hypersurface , it is possible to determine the condition for the deceleration parameter @xmath97 which ensures the contribution of the space - time geometry to the re , @xmath184 to be positive . the aforementioned condition depends both upon the spatial coordinate velocity @xmath129 and the scale factor @xmath111 but only through the physical spatial velocity @xmath143 . in congruences without vorticity , if @xmath174 does not hold all the contributions to the re are non - positive since @xmath65 and the remaining terms are non - positive as we discussed . we found that this condition is not satisfied in the present universe provided that @xmath185 . this means that congruences of geodesics without vorticity with its tangent vector fulfilling @xmath185 will not tend to diverge . in the robertson - walker preferred framework this situation occurs for geodesics moving _ near _ the light cones . these congruences will tend to focus provided that the other terms of the re are negative . besides , a negative contribution from space - time geometry to the re would mean that the attractive character of gravity is restored at high speeds for @xmath186 . the term high speeds must be understood with respect to the preferred framework of a robertson - walker cosmological model which is usually identified with the cmb because of its high isotropy .    in the previous sense , systems may decouple from the cosmological accelerated expansion . this result can help to understand the structure formation of system moving fast , that is favored with respect to slow systems . even taking into account the present value of the deceleration parameter @xmath106 , @xmath172 gives a negative contribution to the re from space - time geometry . this means that in order to get a negative contribution to re from the space - time geometry , it is necessary to move with a velocity bigger than @xmath187 with respect to the preferred framework of robertson - walker space - times . although this value is quite large , the deceleration parameter @xmath97 was smaller in the past and consequently the velocity respect the cmb necessary to accomplish a negative contribution to the re from space - time geometry was also smaller .    to conclude , we would like to highlight the fact that the results obtained in this investigation provide us with a mechanism for a gravitational system to decouple from the accelerated expansion of the universe . this mechanism does not need to appeal to the gravitational interaction of the system itself . although the decoupling of astrophysical systems from the cosmic acceleration is usually carried out by the stronger effect of their own gravitational forces , our investigation may help to understand how geodesic motion in an expanding universe influences this decoupling . * acknowledgments . * we would like to thank prof . g.  f.  r.  ellis for drawing our attention to reference @xcite . this work has been supported by micinn ( spain ) projects numbers fis2011 -

The text also discusses the concept of dark matter (DM) and its role in the universe, which is a hypothetical form of matter that does not interact with light and is thought to make up approximately 27% of the universe's mass-energy density.

The text also discusses the concept of the ""cosm","we study the accelerated expansion of the universe through its consequences on a congruence of geodesics . 
 we make use of the raychaudhuri equation which describes the evolution of the expansion rate for a congruence of timelike or null geodesics . in particular , we focus on the space - time geometry contribution to this equation . by straightforward calculation from the metric of a robertson - walker cosmological model , it follows that in an accelerated expanding universe the space - time contribution to the raychaudhuri equation is positive for the fundamental congruence , favoring a non - focusing of the congruence of geodesics . 
 however , the accelerated expansion of the present universe does not imply a tendency of the fundamental congruence to diverge . 
 it is shown that this is in fact the case for certain congruences of timelike geodesics without vorticity . 
 therefore , the focusing of geodesics remains feasible in an accelerated expanding universe . 
 furthermore , a negative contribution to the raychaudhuri equation from space - time geometry which is usually interpreted as the manifestation of the attractive character of gravity is restored in an accelerated expanding robertson - walker space - time at high speeds .",51066,496,1255,52.98 seconds,2.23 MB,0.3007518796992481,0.0606060606060606,0.20300751879699253,0.8026300072669983,medium
"complex network studies have traditionally focused on single networks in which nodes represent agents and links represent the connections between agents . recent efforts have focused on complex systems that are comprised of interconnected networks , a configuration that more accurately represents real - world networks @xcite . real - world power grids , for example , are almost always coupled with communication networks . power stations need communication nodes for control and communication nodes need power stations for electricity . the influence of coupled networks on cascading failures has been widely studied @xcite . when a node at one end of an interdependent link fails , the node at the other end of the link usually fails . a non - consensus opinion model of two interconnected networks that allows the opinion interaction rules within each individual network to differ from those between the networks was recently studied @xcite . this model shows that opinion interactions between networks can transform non - consensus opinion behavior into consensus opinion behavior .    in this paper we investigate the susceptable - infected - susceptable ( sis ) behavior of a spreading virus , a dynamic process in interconnected networks that has received significant recent attention @xcite . an interconnected networks scenario is essential when modeling epidemics because diseases spread across multiple networks , e.g. , across multiple species or communities , through both contact network links within each species or community and interconnected network links between them . dickison et al . @xcite study the behavior of susceptible - infected - recovered ( sir ) epidemics in interconnected networks . depending on the infection rate in weakly and strongly coupled network systems , where each individual network follows the configuration model and interconnections are randomly placed , epidemics will infect none , one , or both networks of a two - network system . mendiola et al . @xcite show that in sis model an endemic state may appear in the coupled networks even when an epidemic is unable to propagate in each network separately . in this work we will explore how both the structural properties of each individual network and the behavior of the interconnections between them determine the epidemic threshold of two generic interconnected networks .    in order to represent two generic interconnected networks , we represent a network @xmath16 with @xmath1 nodes using an @xmath17 adjacency matrix @xmath18 that consists of elements @xmath19 , which are either one or zero depending on whether there is a link between nodes @xmath13 and @xmath14 . for the interconnected networks , we consider two individual networks @xmath9 and @xmath10 of the same size @xmath1 . when nodes in @xmath9 are labeled from @xmath20 to @xmath1 and in @xmath10 labeled from @xmath21 to @xmath22 , the two isolated networks @xmath9 and @xmath10 can be presented by a @xmath0 matrix @xmath23{cc}a_{1 } & \mathbf{0}\\ \mathbf{0 } & a_{2}\end{array } \right ]   $ ] composed of their corresponding adjacency matrix @xmath18 and @xmath24 respectively . similarly , a @xmath0 matrix @xmath25{cc}\mathbf{0 } & b_{12}\\ b_{12}^{t } & \mathbf{0}\end{array } \right ]   $ ] represents the symmetric interconnections between @xmath9 and @xmath10 . the interconnected networks are composed of three network components : network @xmath18 , network @xmath24 , and interconnecting network @xmath26 .    in the sis model , the state of each agent at time @xmath27 is a bernoulli random variable , where @xmath28 if node @xmath13 is susceptible and @xmath29 if it is infected . the recovery ( curing ) process of each infected node is an independent poisson process with a recovery rate @xmath30 . each infected agent infects each of its susceptible neighbors with a rate @xmath3 , which is also an independent poisson process . the ratio @xmath31 is the effective infection rate . a phase transition has been observed around a critical point @xmath32 in a single network . when @xmath33 , a non - zero fraction of agents will be infected in the steady state , whereas if @xmath34 , infection rapidly disappears @xcite . the epidemic threshold via the n - intertwined mean - field approximation ( nimfa ) is @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix , also called the spectral radius @xcite . for interconnected networks , we assume that the curing rate @xmath30 is the same for all the nodes , that the infection rate along each link of @xmath9 and @xmath10 is @xmath3 , and that the infection rate along each interconnecting link between @xmath9 and @xmath10 is @xmath4 , where @xmath8 is a real constant ranging within @xmath37 without losing generality . we first show that the epidemic threshold for @xmath38 in interconnected networks via nimfa is @xmath39 , where @xmath7 is the largest eigenvalue of the matrix @xmath40 . we further express @xmath7 as a function of each network component @xmath18 , @xmath24 , and @xmath26 and their eigenvalues / eigenvectors to reveal the contribution of each component network . this is a significant mathematical challenge , except for special cases , e.g. , when @xmath41 and @xmath26 commute , i.e. , @xmath42 ( see sec .  [ special cases ] ) . our main contribution is that we analytically derive for the epidemic characterizer @xmath43 ( a ) its perturbation approximation for small @xmath8 , ( b ) its perturbation approximation for large @xmath8 , and ( c ) its lower and upper bound for any @xmath8 as a function of component network @xmath18 , @xmath24 , and @xmath26 and their the largest eigenvalues / eigenvectors . numerical simulations in sec . [ simulation ] verify that these approximations and bounds well approximate @xmath7 , and thus reveal the effect of component network features on the epidemic threshold of the whole system of interconnected networks , which provides essential insights into designing interconnected networks that are robust against the spread of epidemics ( see sec .  [ conclusion ] ) . sahneh et al . @xcite recently studied sis epidemics on generic interconnected networks in which the infection rate can differ between @xmath9 and @xmath10 , and derived the epidemic threshold for the infection rate in one network while assuming that the infection does not survive in the other . their epidemic threshold was expressed as the largest eigenvalue of a function of matrices . our work explains how the epidemic threshold of generic interconnected networks is related to the properties ( eigenvalue / eigenvector ) of each network component @xmath18 , @xmath24 , and @xmath26 without any approximation on the network topology . graph spectra theory @xcite and modern network theory , integrated with dynamic systems theory , can be used to understand how network topology can predict these dynamic processes . youssef and scoglio @xcite have shown that a sir epidemic threshold via nimfa also equals @xmath44 . the kuramoto synchronization process of coupled oscillators @xcite and percolation @xcite also features a phase transition that specifies the onset of a remaining fraction of locked oscillators and the appearance of a giant component , respectively . note that a mean - field approximation predicts both phase transitions at a critical point that is proportional to @xmath44 . thus we expect our results to apply to a wider range of dynamic processes in interconnected networks . in the sis epidemic spreading process , the probability of infection @xmath45 $ ] for a node @xmath13 in interconnected networks @xmath16 is described by @xmath46 via nimfa , where @xmath19 and @xmath47 is an element of matrix @xmath41 and @xmath26 respectively . its matrix form becomes @xmath48 the governing equation of the sis spreading process on a single network @xmath18 is @xmath49 whose epidemic threshold has been proven @xcite to be @xmath50 which is a lower bound of the epidemic threshold @xcite . hence , the epidemic threshold of interconnected networks by nimfa is @xmath51 which depends on the largest eigenvalue of the matrix @xmath6 . the matrix @xmath6 is a weighted matrix , where @xmath52 . note that the nimfa model is an improvement over earlier epidemic models @xcite in that it applies no approximations to network topologies , and thus it allows us to identify the specific role of a general network structure on the spreading process . the spectral radius @xmath7 as shown in the last section is able to characterize epidemic spreading in interconnected networks . in this section we explore how @xmath7 is influenced by the structural properties of interconnected networks and by the relative infection rate @xmath8 along the interconnection links . specifically , we express @xmath7 as a function of the component network @xmath18 , @xmath24 , and @xmath26 and their eigenvalues / eigenvectors . ( for proofs of theorems or lemma , see the appendix . ) we start with some basic properties related to @xmath7 and examine several special cases in which the relation between @xmath43 and the structural properties of network components @xmath18 , @xmath24 and @xmath26 are analytically tractable . the spectral radius of a sub - network is always smaller or equal to that of the whole network . hence ,    @xmath53    [ lowerboundasymptotic]@xmath54    the interconnection network @xmath26 forms a bipartite graph .

[ baerapprox](a ) , the perturbation approximation for small @xmath8 approximates @xmath93 well for a relative large range of @xmath8 , especially for sparser interconnections , i.e. , for a smaller interconnection density @xmath58 . figure  [ baerapprox](b ) shows that the exact spectral radius @xmath93 is already close to the large @xmath8 perturbation approximation , at least for @xmath166 . baerbounds    as depicted in fig . [ baerbounds ] , the lower bound ( [ lowerbound2 ] ) and upper bound ( [ upperbound ] ) are sharp , i.e. , close to @xmath93 for small @xmath8 . the lower and upper bounds are the same as @xmath93 when @xmath167 . for large @xmath8 , the lower bound better approximates @xmath93 when the interconnections are sparser . another lower bound @xmath168 , i.e. , lemma [ lowerboundasymptotic ] , is sharp for large @xmath8 , as shown in fig . [ lowerasymp ] , especially for sparse interconnections . we do not illustrate the lower bound ( [ lowerbound1 ] ) because the lower bound ( [ lowerbound2 ] ) is always sharper or equally good . the lower bound @xmath169 considers only the largest eigenvalue of the interconnection network @xmath26 and ignores the two individual networks @xmath9 and @xmath10 . the difference @xmath170 @xmath171 according to the large @xmath8 perturbation approximation , is shown in fig . [ lowerasymp ] to be larger for denser interconnections . it suggests that @xmath9 and @xmath10 contribute more to the spectral radius of the interconnected networks when the interconnections are denser in this non - degenerate case . for large @xmath8 , the upper bound is sharper when the interconnections are denser or when @xmath58 is larger , as depicted in figure [ baerbounds](b ) . this is because @xmath172 . when the interconnections are sparse , @xmath93 is close to the lower bound @xmath169 and hence far from the upper bound . lowerasympbaer    most interdependent or coupled networks studied so far assume that both individual networks have the same number of nodes @xmath1 and that the two networks are interconnected randomly by @xmath1 one - to - one interconnections , or by a fraction @xmath173 of the @xmath174one - to - one interconnections where @xmath175 @xcite . these coupled networks correspond to our sparse interconnection cases where @xmath176 , when @xmath133 is well approximated by the perturbation approximation for both small and large @xmath8 . the spectral radius @xmath93 increases quadratically with @xmath8 for small @xmath8 , as described by the small @xmath8 perturbation approximation . the increase accelerates as @xmath8 increases and converges to a linear increase with @xmath8 , with slope @xmath133 . here we show the cases in which @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and the interconnections are sparse , as in most real - world networks . however , all the analytical results can be applied to arbitrary interconnected network structures . babaasymp    we assume the spectrum @xcite to be an unique fingerprint of a large network . two large networks of the same size seldom have the same largest eigenvalue . hence , most interconnected networks belong to the non - degenerate case . degenerate cases mostly occur when @xmath9 and @xmath10 are identical , or when they are both regular networks with the same degree . we consider two degenerate cases where both network @xmath9 and @xmath10 are er random networks or ba scale - free networks . both er and ba networks lead to the same observations . hence as an example we show the case in which both @xmath9 and @xmath10 are ba scale - free networks of size @xmath177 and both are randomly interconnected with density @xmath178 $ ] , as in the non - degenerate case . figure  [ babaasym](a ) shows that the perturbation analysis well approximates @xmath93 for small @xmath8 , especially when the interconnection density is small . moreover , the small @xmath8 perturbation approximation performs better in the non - degenerate case , i.e. , is closer to @xmath93 than in degenerate cases [ see fig . [ baerapprox](a ) ] . bababounds    similarly , fig . [ bababounds ] shows that both the lower and upper bound are sharper for small @xmath8 . the lower bound better approximates @xmath101 for sparser interconnections whereas the upper bound better approximates @xmath93 for denser interconnections . thus far we have examined the cases where @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and the interconnections are sparse , as is the case in most real - world networks . however , if both @xmath9 and @xmath10 are dense er random networks and if the random interconnections are also dense , the upper bound is equal to @xmath93 , i.e. , @xmath179 ( see lemma [ lemma_regular ] ) . equivalently , the difference @xmath180 is a constant @xmath147 independent of the interconnection density @xmath58 .    in both the non - degenerate and degenerate case , @xmath93 is well approximated by a perturbation analysis for a large range of small @xmath8 , especially when the interconnections are sparse , and also for a large range of large @xmath8 . the lower bound ( [ lowerbound2 ] ) and upper bound ( [ upperbound ] ) are sharper for small @xmath8 . most real - world interconnected networks are sparse and non - degenerate , where our perturbation approximations are precise for a large range of @xmath8 , and thus reveal well the effect of component network structures on the epidemic characterizer @xmath93 . we study interconnected networks that are composed of two individual networks @xmath9 and @xmath10 , and interconnecting links represented by adjacency matricies @xmath18 , @xmath24 , and @xmath26 respectively . we consider sis epidemic spreading in these generic coupled networks , where the infection rate within @xmath9 and @xmath10 is @xmath3 , the infection rate between the two networks is @xmath4 , and the recovery rate is @xmath30 for all agents . using a nimfa we show that the epidemic threshold with respect to @xmath38 is @xmath39 , where @xmath23{cc}a_{1 } & \mathbf{0}\\ \mathbf{0 } & a_{2}\end{array } \right ]   $ ] is the adjacency matrix of the two isolated networks @xmath9 and @xmath10 . the largest eigenvalue @xmath7 can thus be used to characterize epidemic spreading . this eigenvalue @xmath7 of a function of matrices seldom gives the contribution of each component network . we analytically express the perturbation approximation for small and large @xmath8 , lower and upper bounds for any @xmath8 , of @xmath43 as a function of component networks @xmath18 , @xmath24 , and @xmath26 and their largest eigenvalues / eigenvectors . using numerical simulations , we verify that these approximations or bounds approximate well the exact @xmath7 , especially when the interconnections are sparse and when the largest eigenvalues of the two networks @xmath9 and @xmath10 are different ( the non - degenerate case ) , as is the case in most real - world interconnected networks . hence , these approximations and bounds reveal how component network properties affect the epidemic characterizer @xmath43 . note that the term @xmath181 contributes positively to the perturbation approximation ( [ degenerate ] ) and the lower bound ( [ lowerbound2 ] ) of @xmath7 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the principal eigenvector of network @xmath9 and @xmath10 . this suggests that , given two isolated networks @xmath9 and @xmath10 , the interconnected networks have a larger @xmath7 or a smaller epidemic threshold if the two nodes @xmath13 and @xmath14 with a larger eigenvector component product @xmath15 from the two networks , respectively , are interconnected . this observation provides essential insights useful when designing interconnected networks to be robust against epidemics . the largest eigenvalue also characterizes the phase transition of coupled oscillators and percolation . our results apply to arbitrary interconnected network structures and are expected to apply to a wider range of dynamic processes . we wish to thank onr ( grant n00014 - 09 - 1 - 0380 , grant n00014 - 12 - 1 - 0548 ) , dtra ( grant hdtra-1 - 10 - 1 - 0014 , grant hdtra-1 - 09 - 1 - 0035 ) , nsf ( grant cmmi 1125290 ) , the european epiwork , multiplex , congas ( grant fp7-ict-2011 - 8 - 317672 ) , motia ( grant jls-2009-cips - ag - c1 - 016 ) and linc projects , the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft ( dfg ) , the next generation infrastructure ( bsik ) and the israel science foundation for financial support . in any regular graph , the minimal and maximal node strength are both equal to the average node strength . since the largest eigenvalue is lower bounded by the average node strength and upper bounded by the maximal node strength as proved below in lemma [ boundlamda ] , a regular graph has the minimal possible spectral radius , which equals the average node strength . when the interdependent links are randomly connected with link density @xmath58 , the coupled network is asymptotically a regular graph with average node strength @xmath57+\alpha np_{i}$ ] , if @xmath58 is a constant .

"nearly 30 years ago , padamanabhan @xcite performed a simple calculation suggesting that quantum gravitational fluctuations place a lower bound on distance measurements . he considered fluctuations of the conformal factor @xmath0 in metrics of the form @xmath1 while keeping the background metric @xmath2 classical . crudely speaking , padmanabhan argued that the conformal factor @xmath0 has a green s function that diverges as @xmath3 , in such a way that @xmath4 remains finite in the coincidence limit . this calculation was part of a larger approach to quantum gravity and quantum cosmology in which the conformal factor was treated as a dynamical field to be quantized , while the rest of the metric was treated as a classical field as in standard qft . this approach sidesteps some of the thornier conceptual problems associated with quantizing the metric , since conformal fluctuations preserve the causal structure of spacetime . however , this calculation is almost certainly wrong . in pure einstein - hilbert gravity , the conformal factor is not a dynamical degree of freedom @xcite . this is most clearly seen using the york decomposition of symmetric tensors @xcite , in which the conformal factor is determined by a constraint equation similar to the gauss law constraint in electrodynamics .    to see where the argument went wrong , we must examine the path - integral approach taken by padmanabhan and narlikar @xcite . the classical action and path integral are @xmath5 = \frac{1}{16 \pi g } \int \rmd^4 x \sqrt{-g}(r-2\lambda ) \label{ehaction}\\    z = \int [ \mathcal{d } g ] \textrm{exp}\left\{\rmi s[g]\right\ }    \label{pathintegral}\end{aligned}\ ] ] in terms of the conformal factor and background metric , the action becomes @xmath6 = \frac{1}{16\pi g}\int \rmd^4 x \sqrt{-\bar{g } }    \left[\bar{r}(1+\phi(x))^2 - 2\lambda ( 1+\phi(x))^4 - 6\phi^i\phi_i\right ]    \label{ehconformalaction}\ ] ] from here , the calculation proceeds in a straightforward manner . consider the expectation value of the interval in a ( minkowski ) vacuum state @xmath7 : @xmath8 however , @xmath9 evaluated at a single event diverges . using covariant point - splitting , we instead evaluate the interval between _ two events _ @xmath10 and @xmath11 , in the limit that @xmath12 . with the notation @xmath13 , we examine @xmath14 with @xmath15 , the action is just the action for a massless scalar field , albeit with a negative sign . ] , @xmath16=-\frac{1}{2 l_p^2}\int \phi^i \phi_i \rmd^4x$ ] . the green s function is @xmath17 and so the interval becomes @xmath18 in other words , quantum fluctuations produce a `` ground state length '' just as a harmonic oscillator has a ground state energy . note that the path integral approach taken here obscures the fact that the conformal factor is not a true dynamical field subject to quantum fluctuations . the source of this confusion is the apparent kinetic term in the action , which justifies all subsequent steps leading to . however , in the hamiltonian framework , the trace part of the metric perturbations does not have a canonically conjugate momentum , and a true kinetic term for the conformal factor should not appear in the action . the explanation for the offending term is hidden in the measure of and was finally resolved by mazur and mottola @xcite . to identify the correct measure , they first decomposed the space of metric perturbations into diffeomorphisms and physical fluctuations . the remaining physical subspace was further decomposed into constrained ( conformal ) and dynamical ( transverse - traceless ) degrees of freedom . seen in this light , amounts to a change of coordinates in the space of metrics , which introduces a non - trivial jacobian in the measure . a field redefinition of the conformal factor then turns the apparent kinetic term in into a potential term , confirming the result that the conformal modes are non - propagating constrained modes . while the conformal factor is non - propagating in pure einstein - hilbert gravity , the classical constraints that fix the conformal part of the metric fluctuations in terms of matter sources can not be maintained upon quantization @xcite . the trace anomaly of matter coupled to gravity induces an effective action for the conformal factor that gives rise to non - trivial dynamics @xcite . in other words , the conformal factor is promoted to a dynamical field when gravity is coupled to quantized matter . thus we can revisit padmanabhan s calculation in light of this dynamical model of the conformal factor . we begin by summarizing the basic results of antoniadis , mazur and mottola @xcite . the effective action of the conformal factor becomes local in the conformal parameterization @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a fiducial metric . the total effective action is @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the einstein - hilbert action evaluated at @xmath23 , @xmath24 is the action for matter fields , and @xmath25 is the trace anomaly - induced effective action @xcite @xmath26 = \int \rmd^4x \sqrt{-\bar{g } }        \left[2b^\prime \sigma \bar{\delta}_4 \sigma + b^\prime \left(\bar{e } -

bonnet integrand , respectively . the coupling constants @xmath30 and @xmath31 depend on the matter content of the theory @xcite : @xmath32 where @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the numbers of scalar , weyl fermion , and vector fields . the spin-0 and ghost contributions are included in the -8 and -28 factors , while @xmath36 and @xmath37 count the contributions from the spin-2 metric fields . because the values of these gravitational contributions , as well as contributions beyond the standard model , remain open questions , @xmath38 will be treated as a free parameter . the total trace anomaly of the full theory described by must vanish @xcite . the absence of this anomaly requires that the vacuum is a conformal fixed point at which the @xmath39 functions of all couplings must vanish . the physical metric then acquires an anomalous scaling dimension @xmath40 where @xmath41 is determined by the @xmath39 function for the einstein - hilbert action @xcite , @xmath42    from here we can follow padmanabhan s prescription . looking only at conformal fluctuations and choosing a minkowski fiducial metric @xmath7 , the action reduces to @xmath43 = -\frac{q^2}{(4\pi)^2}\int \rmd^4x \sigma    \bar{\box}^2 \sigma + \frac{1}{8\pi g}\int \rmd^4x \left[3e^{2\alpha \sigma}\left(\partial_a \sigma\right)^2 -

order kinetic term is @xmath47 in momentum space , which is just a logarithm in coordinate space : @xmath48 , \label{propagator}\ ] ] where @xmath49 is an infrared cutoff .    now the expectation value of the interval becomes @xmath50^{2-\alpha^2/2q^2 } , \label{metricexpectation}\end{aligned}\ ] ] where the first line makes use of covariant point - splitting , and normal ordering is used on each operator @xmath51 individually . the second equality in is a standard field theory result that makes use of the baker - campbell - hausdorff relation @xcite and minkowski space @xcite confirm both of these requirements . ] . this yields the interesting result that the scaling depends on the matter content : the distance approaches zero for all values @xmath52 or @xmath53 . from , positive values of @xmath54 are excluded at the conformal fixed point . the interval is constant at the critical point @xmath55 , and @xmath56 gives the nonsensical result that distances diverge in the limit @xmath57 . for large @xmath38 , the interval scales as @xmath58 , and classical scaling is recovered in the limit @xmath59 . it follows from that @xmath60 for normal matter ; however , it is worth noting that some models of conformal supergravity contribute negatively to @xmath38 @xcite . calculations of the one - loop contributions from einstein gravity place it at @xmath61 @xcite . together , the standard model particle content ( @xmath62 and @xmath63 ) and one - loop gravitational contributions give a value @xmath64 the greatest uncertainty in the value of @xmath38 comes from the gravitational contributions , and a precise theoretical prediction for @xmath38 remains an open problem . recent attempts to place observational limits on @xmath38 using wmap data claim to limit @xmath38 to the range @xmath65 @xcite . thus a more complete treatment of conformal fluctuations using the trace anomaly - induced effective action do not place a lower bound on the distance between two points . of course this result should be viewed with some skepticism . in particular , the spin-2 metric fluctuations are expected to become important around the planck scale but have been frozen out in this approach . additionally , the transition from einstein gravity to the conformally invariant phase described by is poorly understood , and more research is need to determine the scales at which the effective action becomes significant . i would like to thank steve carlip for comments on early versions of this paper . this work was supported in part by the department of energy grant de -

[ fig : grotr ] ) could be sufficiently realistic for computing the line - center polarization of ly@xmath0 . the only level that produces scattering polarization in the core of the ly@xmath0 line is the @xmath12 upper level . it is interesting to note that the suitability of the above - mentioned three - level model atom implies that the atomic polarization of the @xmath12 level ( population imbalances and quantum coherence between its magnetic sublevels ) is dominated by the absorption of anisotropic radiation in the resonance line transition itself and by the action of the hanle effect on such upper level , without any serious impact of collisional depolarization . the critical hanle field of the level @xmath12 is @xmath13 g and the scattering polarization of the on - disk ly@xmath0 radiation is sensitive to magnetic strengths between 10 and 100 g , approximately @xcite    to compute the emergent stokes profiles @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 at each surface point of the atmospheric model we have to solve the following radiative transfer equations for any desired line of sight ( @xmath17 being @xmath14 , @xmath15 or @xmath16 ) @xmath18 where @xmath19 defines the monochromatic optical path length along the ray direction ( with @xmath20 the corresponding geometrical distance ) , @xmath21 is the absorption coefficient , and @xmath22 is the source function of the stokes parameter @xmath17 , with @xmath23 the emission coefficient . is the only non - zero coefficient of the propagation matrix of the stokes - vector transfer equation , because the zeeman splitting is negligible compared to the width of the hydrogen ly@xmath0 line and the angular momentum of its lower level is @xmath24 and , therefore , can not carry atomic alignment . ] while the emission coefficient @xmath25 has contributions from the two blended transitions indicated in fig . [ fig : grotr ] , @xmath26 and @xmath27 depend only on the atomic polarization of the @xmath8 upper level ( because it is the only ly@xmath0 level that can carry atomic alignment ) . we quantify the population and atomic polarization of this @xmath28 level by means of the multipolar components of its atomic density matrix ( i.e. , the @xmath29 components , with @xmath30 and @xmath31 , as quantified in the reference system whose quantization axis is along the local vertical ) or , equivalently , by the following quantities ( with the @xmath29 components normalized to the fraction of neutral hydrogen atoms that are in the ground level ) : @xmath32 . in our radiative transfer calculations with porta we have used the exact @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 expressions , which take into account that the two ly@xmath0 transitions are not perfectly overlapped . such transitions are actually very close in wavelength ( they are only about 6 m  apart ) and , for simplicity , we give here the @xmath34 and @xmath35 expressions for the perfect overlapping case :    @xmath36 - \sin \chi { \rm im}[{s}^2_1 ] )      \nonumber   \\    & - &   \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2 } ( 1+\mu^2 ) ( \cos 2\chi   { \rm re}[{s}^2_2 ] -\sin 2\chi \ , { \rm im}[{s}^2_2 ] )    \big{\}}\ ; , \nonumber\end{aligned}\ ] ]    and @xmath37+\cos \chi { \rm im}[{s}^2_1 ] )      \label{eq : su }       \\ \nonumber    & \quad+\mu ( \sin 2\chi \ , { \rm re}[{s}^2_2 ] + \cos 2\chi \ , { \rm im}[{s}^2_2])\big{\}}\;,\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the inclination with respect to the solar local vertical and azimuth of the ray , respectively , and @xmath40 ( with @xmath41 and @xmath42 the continuum and the line - integrated opacities , respectively , and @xmath43 the voigt line absorption profile ) . in such equations the reference direction for stokes @xmath15 is in the plane formed by the ray s propagation direction and the vertical @xmath44-axis . we point out that eqs . ( [ eq : sq ] ) and ( [ eq : su ] ) , with their corresponding eqs . ( [ eq : rte ] ) , imply that the sources of stokes @xmath15 are the population imbalances ( @xmath45 ) and the quantum coherence ( @xmath46 , with @xmath47 ) , while the stokes @xmath16 signal is produced only by quantum coherence ( @xmath46 , with @xmath47 ) between pairs of sublevels pertaining to the @xmath8 excited level . to solve eqs . ( [ eq : rte ] ) for any desired line of sight ( los ) we need to know first @xmath21 and the @xmath48 source function components at each spatial grid point . to obtain the self - consistent values of such quantities we have to solve jointly the statistical equilibrium equations for the multipolar components ( @xmath49 ) of the atomic density matrix corresponding to each atomic level @xmath50 and the radiative transfer equations for each of the radiative transitions in the chosen model atom . the general expressions of such equations can be found in sections 7.2 and 7.13.c of @xcite , which we solved applying porta . we used a gaussian quadrature for the ray inclinations with respect to the vertical @xmath44-axis ( with 5 inclinations per octant ) and the trapezoidal rule for the ray azimuth ( with 4 azimuths per octant ) . in our radiative transfer calculations we took into account the impact of the doppler shifts , produced by the macroscopic velocity gradients of the 3d atmospheric model , on the anisotropic radiation pumping . although this physical ingredient is not very important for modeling the scattering polarization of the hydrogen ly@xmath0 line ( because the line is very broad ) , porta takes it fully into account because the dynamic state of the solar atmosphere may produce observable signatures on the scattering polarization of some chromospheric lines @xcite . our calculations with porta were carried out in the marenostrum iii supercomputer of the barcelona supercomputing center . the total computing time of the non - lte calculations carried out for the investigation of this paper exceeded one million cpu hours .    to grasp better the physics of this complex radiative transfer problem it is useful to write down a simplified set of equations , instead of the general equations for the four - level model atom of fig .  [ fig : grotr ] we have actually solved with porta to obtain all the results shown in this paper . to this end , we note that the weakly inelastic collisions with protons and electrons that couple the @xmath9 level with the @xmath51 and @xmath52 ones , which we have taken into account in our 3d radiative transfer calculations , do not really have a significant depolarizing effect on the ly@xmath0 polarization in the considered model atmosphere @xcite . taking also into account that elastic collisions with neutral hydrogen atoms can be safely neglected when modeling the line - core polarization of ly@xmath0 and that the only level contributing to the ly@xmath0 scattering polarization is the @xmath52 one , we have the following approximate expressions for the @xmath53 tensors that quantify the excitation state of the @xmath52 upper level @xcite :    @xmath54 \\\\        { { \rm im}[{s}^2_1 } ] \\\\         { { \rm re}[{s}^2_2 } ] \\\\        { { \rm im}[{s}^2_2 } ]      \end{array } \right ) & = &      { { ( 1-\epsilon)}\over{\sqrt{2 } } }     \left ( \begin{array}{r }        { j}^2_0 \\\\        { \rm re}[{j}{}^{2}_{1 } ] \\\\        -{\rm im}[{j}{}^{2}_{1 } ] \\\\        { \rm re}[{j}{}^{2}_{2 } ] \\\\ -{\rm im}[{j}{}^{2}_{2 } ]      \end{array } \right)\ , \\      & \!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\ ! + & \!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\ ! { \gamma_u}\ , { { ( 1-\epsilon)}}\ ,      \left ( \begin{array}{cccccc }          0 & m_{12 } & m_{13 } & 0 & 0 \\\\           m_{21 } & 0 & m_{23 } & m_{24 } & m_{25 } \\\\ m_{31 } & m_{32 } & 0 & m_{34 } & m_{35 } \\\\          0 & m_{42 } & m_{43 } & 0 & m_{45 } \\\\          0 & m_{52 } & m_{53 } & m_{54 } & 0         \end{array } \right )       \left ( \begin{array}{l }          { s^2_0 } \\\\          { { \rm re}[{s}^2_1 } ] \\\\          { { \rm im}[{s}^2_1 } ] \\\\          { { \rm re}[{s}^2_2 } ] \\\\ { { \rm im}[{s}^2_2 } ]       \end{array } \right)\ , , \nonumber\end{aligned}\ ] ]    where @xmath55 is the planck function at the ly@xmath0 line - center frequency , @xmath56 is the photon collisional destruction probablility , @xmath57 ( with the magnetic strength @xmath58 in gauss ) , and the @xmath59 coefficients of the magnetic kernel @xmath60 depend on the inclination ( @xmath61 ) of the local magnetic field vector with respect to the vertical @xmath44-axis and on its azimuth ( @xmath62 ) . the frequency averaged ( over the absorption profile @xmath43 ) radiation field tensors @xmath63 that appear in such equations quantify the mean intensity ( @xmath64 ) , the anisotropy ( @xmath65 ) , and the breaking of the axial symmetry ( the real and imaginary parts of @xmath66 and @xmath67 ) of the incident radiation field at each point within the medium ; their explicit expressions can be found in @xcite , but note that the stokes @xmath14 of the incident ly@xmath0 radiation has to be calculated taking into account that it results from two blended transitions ( see fig . [ fig : grotr ] ) . the equations for the @xmath68 ( atomic ) quantities have a clear physical meaning . in particular , note that the magnetic operator @xmath60 couples locally the @xmath69 components among them ( the hanle effect ) . the top left panel of fig . [ fig : jkq ] shows the spatial variation of the kinetic temperature across a 2d slice through the above - mentioned 3d snapshot model atmosphere ; it corresponds to the @xmath44-@xmath70 plane at @xmath71 mm in fig.[fig : mgf ] . note that the height of the tr changes drastically from one horizontal location to another , outlining a highly crumpled surface . as shown by the white solid curve , the corrugated surface that delineates the model s tr practically coincides with that defined by the ly@xmath0 line - center optical depth unity along the line of sight ( los ) . the other panels of fig . [ fig : jkq ] show the radiation field tensors @xmath72 of the ly@xmath0 radiation , normalized to @xmath73 . such quantities quantify the fractional anisotropy and the symmetry properties of the incident radiation at each point within the medium . we calculated them after obtaining with the 3d radiative transfer code porta the self - consistent solution in the 3d snapshot model illustrated in fig.[fig : mgf ] , using the four - level model atom of fig . [ fig : grotr ] and taking into account the ( very weak ) collisional coupling between the @xmath9 and the two @xmath10 levels . of particular interest is the spatial variation of the fractional anisotropy ( top right panel ) ; it is negligible in the photosphere and chromosphere of the model , but it suddenly becomes significant right at the location of the tr with negative values of about 10% . the other radiation field tensors shown in the remaining panels quantify the breaking of the axial symmetry of the ly@xmath0 radiation at each point within the model atmosphere ; note that at the atmospheric heights where the line center optical depth is unity such tensors may have sizable positive or negative values , depending on the horizontal point under consideration . the multipolar components of the atomic density matrix ( i.e. , the @xmath29 quantities or , equivalently , the @xmath53 ones ) quantify the excitation state of the atomic level under consideration . as mentioned above , the scattering polarization of ly@xmath0 is produced by the atomic polarization of its @xmath8 upper level ; therefore , in this section we provide information on the spatial variation of the level s fractional atomic polarization throughout the same @xmath44-@xmath70 plane considered in fig . [ fig : jkq ] . ( [ eq : mtx-20 ] ) indicate that for @xmath74 ( i.e. , in the unmagnetized case ) each multipolar component @xmath75 of the @xmath8 level is directly proportional to its corresponding radiation field tensor component . we can say that there is a transfer of ` order ' from the radiation field to the atomic system , and eqs . ( [ eq : rte])([eq : su ] ) show that the atoms of a polarized ( ` ordered ' ) atomic system emit linearly polarized radiation . ( [ eq : mtx-20 ] ) indicate that if all @xmath76 were zero then all @xmath46 would vanish , even in the presence of a magnetic field . through the hanle effect the magnetic field modifies the polarization of the atomic level according to the @xmath77 term of eqs . ( [ eq : mtx-20 ] ) , and this has an impact on the emergent linear polarization @xmath78 and @xmath79 signals .    fig . [ fig : rhokq ] shows the multipolar components of the density matrix corresponding to the @xmath8 level , normalized to the @xmath80 value of the same level ( which is proportional to its overall population ) . note that the @xmath81 panel ( which quantifies the population imbalances among the sublevels of the @xmath8 level ) shows mainly negative values at the atmospheric heights where the ly@xmath0 line center optical depth is unity along the los , while each of the quantum coherence shown in the other panels shows both positive and negative values . this section considers the case of spatially resolved observations . it shows maps of the line - center scattering polarization , which we have obtained by calculating the emergent stokes profiles of the ly@xmath0 radiation after obtaining the self - consistent solution of the above - mentioned 3d radiative transfer problem . of particular interest is to investigate the spatial variability of the emergent @xmath78 and @xmath79 line - center signals and their sensitivity to the model s magnetic field . to this end , we solved the 3d radiative transfer problem of resonance line polarization for the following two cases : ( 1 ) taking into account the hanle effect produced by the magnetic field of the 3d snapshot model atmosphere and ( 2 ) assuming @xmath82 g at each spatial grid point of the 3d model . we show the results for two line of sights ( los ) defined by @xmath83 ( with @xmath2 the heliocentric angle ) : @xmath84 ( corresponding to a disk center observation ) and @xmath85 ( corresponding to another on - disk observation , but at about 80  seconds of arc from the solar limb ) . in all our calculations of the emergent stokes profiles the azimuth of the corresponding los was @xmath86  that is , the los was contained in the @xmath17-@xmath44 plane . in all the following figures we have chosen the @xmath70-axis as the positive reference direction for stokes @xmath15 , and for any los with @xmath87 we chose this @xmath70-direction as the parallel to the nearest limb . [ fig : dco ] shows , for the forward scattering case of a disk center observation ( los with @xmath84 ) , the intensity ( top left panel ) , the total fractional linear polarization ( @xmath88 , top right panel ) , and the @xmath78 ( bottom left panel ) and @xmath79 ( bottom right panel ) signals at the center of the emergent ly@xmath0 intensity profile . the calculated ly@xmath0 line - center intensity variations across the surface of the 3d atmospheric model show fibril - like structures , reminiscent of those observed at 1  arcsecond resolution by the vault sounding rocket ( e.g. , * ? ? ? although we do not show illustrations here , we point out that the effects of 3d radiative transfer do have an impact on the emergent line - center intensities , as expected from the smoothing effect produced by horizontal radiative transfer under non - lte conditions ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) ; the so - called 1.5d approximation gives a larger line - center intensity contrast across the field of view . the same applies to other spectral lines such as hydrogen h@xmath0 for which this effect is even more significant due to the lower opacity of the line @xcite . it is interesting to note that at high spatial resolution the linear polarization signals of the emergent ly@xmath0 line - center radiation are very significant ( see fig .  [ fig : dco ] ) . at first sight this result might appear surprising , given that in fig . [ fig : dco ] we are considering the forward scattering case of a disk - center observation . however , in this scattering geometry zero linear polarization should be expected only for the idealized case of an unmagnetized and horizontally homogeneous stellar atmosphere model . as soon as there is a magnetic field inclined with respect to the symmetry axis of the incident radiation field ( hereafter , inclined field ) and/or horizontal atmospheric inhomogeneities ( e.g. , in the gas kinetic temperature and/or density ) the ensuing symmetry breaking effects can produce significant line scattering polarization signals ( see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * and more references therein ) . the linear polarization signals of fig . [ fig : dco ] are due to the breaking of the axial symmetry of the ly@xmath0 radiation at each spatial point within the 3d model atmosphere , as quantified by the real and imaginary parts of the @xmath89 and @xmath90 radiation field tensors , as well to the magnetic field of the atmospheric model ( see eqs .  [ eq : mtx][eq : mtx-20 ] ) . the @xmath78 and @xmath79 line - center signals shown in the bottom panels of fig .  [ fig : dco ] have similar values that fluctuate in sign across the field of view , as expected from the particularization of eqs . ( [ eq : sq ] ) and ( [ eq : su ] ) to the case of a los with @xmath84 . in particular , the image corresponding to the total linear polarization at the line center ( see the top right panel of fig . [ fig : dco ] ) shows an impressive detail of fine - scale structuring . as explained above , the forward - scattering polarization signals are caused by both the model s horizontal atmospheric inhomogeneities in temperature , density , and macroscopic velocity , and by the magnetic field . as shown in the top left panel of fig . [ fig : diff ] , there are very significant forward scattering polarization signals in the absence of magnetic fields . such zero - field linear polarization signals are solely due to the symmetry breaking caused by the horizontal atmospheric inhomogeneties ; therefore , their very existence indicates that the so - called 1.5d approximation is unsuitable for modeling high spatio - temporal resolution observations of the scattering polarization in ly@xmath0 . [ fig : diff ] shows that there is a significant difference between the true total fractional linear polarization ( calculated taking into account the hanle effect produced by the magnetic field of the 3d model atmosphere ) and that corresponding to the zero - field reference case . as expected , the action of the hanle effect in forward scattering geometry is found mainly along the diagonal of the image seen in fig . [ fig : diff ] , where the magnetization of the model atmosphere is the largest . however , as seen in the figure , the model s magnetic field tends to depolarize the emergent radiation , and this occurs mainly in the strongly polarized regions of the unmagnetized case . this contrasts with the case of a plane - parallel model atmosphere , where in the absence of magnetic fields the symmetry axis of the incident radiation coincides with the vertical direction and the hanle effect of an inclined magnetic field creates linear polarization in forward scattering geometry but depolarization in close to the limb observations . in our 3d model atmosphere the symmetry axis of the radiation field that illuminates each of the points of the tr does not in general coincide with the local vertical . in fig . [ fig : trnorm ] , we attempt to visualize the geometrical complexity of the present 3d problem by showing , at each point of the field of view , the inclination of the vector that is normal to the tr surface . in the unmagnetized case the strongly polarized regions are typically those for which the inclination of the local normal vector to the tr surface is larger , and depolarization by the hanle effect is statistically more likely . in regions where the local normal vector to the tr surface is predominantly vertical the forward scattering signals of the unmagnetized case are typically lower and the hanle effect produced by the model s magnetic field tends to be more similar to that found in the case of a plane - parallel model atmosphere . these two situations can be understood by analogy with the scattering polarization signals calculated in a 1d plane - parallel model near the limb and at the disk center , respectively ( cf . we now consider a los with @xmath85 , which corresponds to the case of an observation relatively close to the solar limb . [ fig : clo ] shows maps of the line - center intensity ( top left panel ) , of the total fractional linear polarization ( top right panel ) , as well as of the @xmath78 ( bottom left panel ) and @xmath79 ( bottom right panel ) line - center signals . the particularization of eqs . ( [ eq : sq ] ) and ( [ eq : su ] ) to the los under consideration ( or to any los with @xmath91 ) indicates that @xmath27 ( the emissivity in stokes @xmath16 at each point along the los ) depends only on the quantum coherence ( @xmath92 and @xmath93 ) of the @xmath8 excited level , while @xmath26 ( the emissivity in stokes @xmath15 at each point along the los ) depends also on the population imbalances between the sublevels of the excited level . as indicated by eq . ( [ eq : mtx-20 ] ) , the population imbalances , quantified by @xmath45 , are determined mainly by the radiation field tensor @xmath94 , which at the crumpled surface that delineates the model s tr tends to be negative ( as in the 1d atmospheric models considered by * ? ? ? we therefore expect that the @xmath78 signals of the emergent ly@xmath0 radiation across the surface of the 3d model have mainly negative sign . for the @xmath79 signals we expect the occurrence of positive and negative values to be equally likely , following the fact ( see eq . [ eq : mtx-20 ] ) that the radiation field tensors @xmath89 and @xmath90 ( which quantify the symmetry breaking of the incident radiation field ) play a key role on the quantum coherence quantified by @xmath95 and @xmath96 . the upper panel of fig . [ fig : histo ] shows the histogram of the line center polarization amplitudes of the emergent ly@xmath0 radiation calculated in forward scattering geometry ( los with @xmath84 ) assuming @xmath82 g . most of the linear polarization signals have values between 0 and 1% , but there is a clear tail of stronger polarization signals extending up to about 3% . in this forward scattering geometry the mean fractional linear polarization amplitude at the maximum spatial resolution of the 3d model is @xmath97    the bottom panel of fig . [ fig : histo ] shows an analogous histogram , but for the case of a los with @xmath85 . as in the @xmath84 case ( see the upper panel of fig . [ fig : histo ] ) , almost all the surface points are significantly polarized . in contrast , in this close to the limb scattering geometry there is only a minority of surface points with @xmath98% and there is a significantly larger fraction of points of the field of view showing strong polarization signals with @xmath99% . as a result , the mean fractional linear polarization amplitude at the maximum spatial resolution of the 3d model is now @xmath100 . [ fig : clprofs ] shows , for the case of a close to the limb los with @xmath85 , the synthetic @xmath78 and @xmath79 profiles computed at each @xmath70-point without accounting for any spatial degradation ; the @xmath70-direction here can be assumed to be along the spectrograph s slit , assuming it to be oriented parallel to the nearest limb ( i.e. , the @xmath70 axis ) . of great interest is to compare the top panels ( the zero - field reference case ) with the bottom panels ( where the hanle effect of the model s magnetic field has been taken into account ) . in both cases the @xmath78 signals are mainly negative , as expected from the behavior of the radiation field anisotropy ( @xmath101 ) illustrated in fig . [ fig : jkq ] . however , the polarization amplitudes are larger in the absence of magnetic fields , with a sizable factor of difference in the atmospheric regions where the magnetic field of the 3d model is relatively strong and inclined ( e.g. , see the region around @xmath102 mm ) . the action of the hanle effect can also be clearly seen in the @xmath79 signals ( right panels ) . the results shown above indicate that at high spatial resolution we should expect conspicuous linear polarization signals in the ly@xmath0 line core , with amplitudes often larger than @xmath103% . these @xmath78 and @xmath79 signals are produced by anisotropic radiation pumping in the upper solar chromosphere and they are modified , via the hanle effect , by the vector magnetic field of the model s tr . in the following section , we turn our attention to the case of spatially averaged observations . signal that results from spatially averaging the stokes @xmath14 and @xmath15 line - center signals at each @xmath104 location , averaged over all the los azimuths @xmath39 , with ( solid curve ) and without ( dotted curve ) the hanle effect produced by the model s magnetic field . the dashed curve corresponds to the hanle effect saturation regime . the dash - dotted curve shows the calculated clv in the semi - empirical model c of @xcite . , width=302 ]     the figure shows the spatially averaged @xmath78 amplitude vs. the mean magnetic field strength of the model s transition region . the arrow indicates the @xmath78 signal corresponding to the original 3d model . , width=302 ]    the solar atmosphere is a highly inhomogeneous and dynamic medium , much more complex than the idealization of a 1d , static , plane - parallel semi - empirical model atmosphere . in a 1d model atmosphere with axial symmetry around the local vertical the only possibility to break the axial symmetry of the incident radiation field at each point within the medium is by the presence of a magnetic field inclined with respect to the solar radius vector through the point under consideration ( see * ? ? ? * and more references therein ) . in the real solar atmosphere we have , in addition , the symmetry breaking produced by the horizontal inhomogeneities of the atmospheric plasma , in its density , velocity and kinetic temperature . these ( non - magnetic ) causes of symmetry breaking produce @xmath78 and @xmath79 signals which could be confused with those resulting from the hanle effect .    in this paper we represent the complexity of the tr of the sun by a single snapshot taken from the three - dimensional mhd simulation described in section  [ sec : formulation ] . one possible way to obtain quantitative information on the magnetization of the solar tr is to study the statistical properties of the ly@xmath0 polarization signals , and their relation with the physical quantities that describe the 3d atmospheric model . the first step towards this goal is to consider the average polarization signals and how they can be exploited to infer information on the average magnetic field strength in the tr . in this section , we study the sensitivity of the emergent @xmath78 and @xmath79 line - center signals to the model s magnetic field , considering spatially averaged synthetic observations . as shown below , such spatially - averaged signals can be used to obtain quantitative information on the average magnetization of the solar tr . if not stated otherwise , the results of this section are shown for a los with azimuth @xmath105 , i.e. , with the @xmath70-axis parallel to the nearest solar limb which is also our reference direction for stokes @xmath15 . in order to simplify the notation , in what follows the spatially averaged quantities @xmath106 , @xmath107 , and @xmath108 will be denoted by @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath10 . if the spatial resolution of the observation is reduced , the emergent stokes profiles @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 are averaged over the corresponding resolution element . at the disk center , the @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath10 signals are therefore generally degraded because of cancellation of the positive and negative signals coming from different regions of the atmosphere . let us consider a square resolution element of size @xmath4 located at the solar disk center . in fig . [ fig : char ] we show the variation with @xmath3 of the total polarization signal @xmath10 at the ly@xmath0 line center . this result has been obtained statistically , after computing the emergent stokes profiles for many possible realizations of the resolution element position . as seen in the figure , at @xmath109 the total polarization line - center signal decreases by a factor two with respect to the maximum resolution value . three seconds of arc can therefore be regarded as a characteristic spatial scale of the polarized structures seen at the center of the ly@xmath0 line . we can therefore argue that unless the spatial resolution of the observation is significantly better than 3 arcseconds , the polarization of the emergent radiation will be a mixture of signals coming from locations having significantly different plasma structures . likewise , we can expect that for inferring the average properties of the solar tr , the spatial resolution of a single observation should be much worse than 3 arcseconds , so that the influence of the local inhomogeneities is sufficiently reduced .    for the case of a disk - center observation , the line - center signal @xmath10 tends to zero in the limit of no spatial resolution . for any los with @xmath87 , the spatially averaged signals will be generally non - zero and converging , in the limit of no spatial resolution , to the values given by the center - to - limb variation ( clv ) . this applies to the unmagnetized case , but as shown in fig . [ fig : clvav ] it happens also when we take into account the hanle effect produced by the weak magnetic field of the chosen 3d model atmosphere . the clv of the emergent spectral line radiation contains useful information on the structuring of the solar atmosphere . in quiet regions of the solar surface the observed clv of the stokes-@xmath14 profile of the hydrogen ly@xmath0 line is known to be negligible ( e.g. , * ? ? ? however , radiative transfer calculations in the semi - empirical model c of @xcite ( hereafter , fal - c model ) , show that the clv of the @xmath78 line - center signal is rather significant ( cf . the fig .  2 of * ? ? ? * ) . here we study the clv of the spatially - averaged @xmath78 line center signals in the chosen 3d model . the results are shown in fig . [ fig : clvav ] for the case of azimuthally averaged line of sights of inclination @xmath104 . only the @xmath78 line - center signal is shown because , as expected , the spatially averaged @xmath79 signal is practically zero for all heliocentric angles . interestingly , the behavior of the resulting clv of the line - center @xmath78 signal is qualitatively similar to that found in the fal - c model ( see the dash - dotted line in fig . [ fig : clvav ] ) . the largest fractional polarization amplitude is found around @xmath110 and it decreases towards larger heliocentric angles . in contrast to the clv behavior found in 1d models , the decrease of the @xmath78 line - center amplitude when approaching the limb of the 3d atmospheric model is not so significant and in the chosen 3d model the @xmath78 signal is still sizable at near - limb locations .    without spatio - temporal resolution , the resulting @xmath78 signals drop below the 1% level , with amplitudes similar to those found in 1d semi - empirical models . therefore , their measurement requires advanced instrumentation , capable of reaching a polarimetric sensitivity of at least 0.1% . via the hanle effect , the spatially - averaged @xmath78 signals are clearly sensitive to the model s magnetic field ( see fig .  [ fig : clvav ] ) .      following the approach introduced in section  4 of @xcite , we study the magnetic sensitivity of the spatially - averaged polarization amplitudes in the 3d snapshot model atmosphere . we define the quantity @xmath111 as the average magnetic field strength at the points where the optical depth at the ly@xmath0 line center is unity for the case of a disk - center observation . given the  height of formation "" of the ly@xmath0 line center , @xmath111 can also be understood as the average magnetic field strength in the tr . we follow the approach of @xcite and multiply the magnetic field strength at each grid point of the 3d model by a dimensionless factor @xmath112 . in this way , we can study the dependence of the line polarization on the average field strength @xmath113 . the result for the @xmath78 line center amplitude is shown in fig . [ fig : bsens ] for a near - limb observation with @xmath85 . is not shown because this quantity remains practically zero for all values of @xmath114 . ] as expected , the maximum polarization signal is found in the unmagnetized case ( @xmath115 ) . the arrow in the figure indicates the actual value of the average tr magnetization ( the @xmath116 case ) which is @xmath117 g . the @xmath78 polarization signal gradually decreases as the magnetic field increases . in contrast to the 2d result shown in fig .  4 of @xcite , in the 3d model the @xmath78 signal is lower and its maximum amplitude is more similar to that found in the fal - c unmagnetized model . amplitude on the averaging length along the spectrograph s slit , with the slit located at @xmath85 and oriented parallel to the model s solar limb . the figure shows the polarization signal modified by the hanle effect of the model s magnetic field ( red solid curve ) , the solution without the magnetic field ( dash - dotted curve ) , and the solution obtained with the magnetic field strength increased by a factor 4 at every point of the atmospheric model ( green solid curve ) . the error bars indicate the standard deviation of the @xmath78 amplitudes calculated from the statistics of randomly positioned slits . , width=302 ]     signal , integrated along the @xmath118 slit , as a function of the averaged magnetic field strength @xmath119 of the model s transition region . blue curve : slit oriented radially and extending from @xmath120 to @xmath121 . red curve : slit oriented tangentially with the slit center located at @xmath85 . , width=302 ]    the chromospheric ly@xmath0 spectropolarimeter ( clasp ) has been designed for measuring the core of the stokes @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 profiles using a spectrograph with a slit of @xmath118 , with a spatial resolution of about @xmath122 , a spectral resolution of 0.1  and a polarimetric sensitivity of @xmath123 at the @xmath124 level ( see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? in order to reach this level of polarimetric sensitivity it will be necessary to significantly sacrifice the temporal resolution and to partially average the observed stokes @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 signals along the direction of the spectrograph s slit , in order to increase the signal - to - noise ratio . nevertheless , in addition to the important goal of measuring for the first time scattering polarization in a fuv line ( hydrogen ly@xmath0 ) whose core originates in the solar tr , clasp can still aim at constraining the average magnetization of the tr by partial spectrum averaging along the spectrograph slit .    an important question to consider is whether the spectrograph s slit , which selects solar light along a distance of @xmath125 on the solar disk ( i.e. , almost one half of the apparent solar radius ) , should be oriented radially or tangentially with respect to the solar limb , in order to maximize the chances of detection of the expected scattering polarization in ly@xmath0 and the scientific output of the clasp experiment . we dedicate this section to analyze the pros and cons of both options . although both options seem to be suitable for detecting the scattering polarization signals , we have some reasons to prefer the radial option ( see below ) . we begin our analysis by considering the case of tangential orientation of the spectrograph s slit , with its center located at the heliocentric angle @xmath85 , i.e. , at an on - disk position where the spatially - averaged @xmath78 signal is maximal ( cf . fig .  [ fig : clvav ] ) . we have studied the dependence of the spatially - averaged @xmath78 line - center signal on the length @xmath126 ( in arc seconds ) along the slit s direction over which we average the computed stokes @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 signals . we have done this analysis by averaging the individual signals corresponding to a large number of randomly positioned virtual slits on top of the 3d model grid . this has been done by selecting randomly the @xmath127 $ ] point that corresponds to the first point of the slit . the average is then obtained by integration of the @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 signals along the randomly selected slit . if the virtual slit crosses the model s boundary , then the integration continues along the same direction but starting at the opposite boundary , with a random position along this boundary . this way , it is possible to obtain slit - integrated signals for a large number of slits that are longer than the model s dimensions ( which is about @xmath128 ) . we have applied this procedure for averaging lengths between @xmath129 and @xmath130 . the results are shown in fig . [ fig : bdet ] for three different degrees of the model s magnetization . it is important to emphasize that the spatialy - averaged @xmath78 signal depends on @xmath126 : stronger signals are found , on average , for smaller lengths @xmath126 . this is due to the fact that @xmath78 depends on correlations between @xmath15 and @xmath14 at particular pixels . in our 3d model , the regions with lower line intensity are , on average , more polarized than the high - intensity regions . consequently , stronger signals are obtained for smaller lengths @xmath126 . the spread of the resulting @xmath78 signals is indicated by the error bars in the figure , which correspond to the standard deviation of each @xmath78 value for any given length @xmath126 . as expected , the larger @xmath126 , the smaller the spread of the values . averaging over the whole @xmath118 distance of the clasp spectrograph s slit would provide a @xmath131 test for detection of the zero magnetization versus the actual model magnetization ( @xmath132 g ) of the 3d model . similarly , @xmath133 would be sufficient for a test distinguishing between a non - magnetized and a strongly magnetized ( @xmath134 g ) transition region , with a similar level of confidence . [ fig : bdettara ] shows , both for the radial and tangential slit options , how the spatially - averaged ( including averaging along the whole length of the spectrograph s slit ) @xmath78 line - center signal of the emergent ly@xmath0 radiation from the 3d model varies with the average magnetization value of the model s tr . for each average magnetization , @xmath113 , a very large number of @xmath78 signals were obtained by a method analogous to the one described in the previous paragraph . in the radial - slit option case , the fact that the @xmath78 signal varies with the heliocentric angle ( see fig .  [ fig : clvav ] ) has been taken into account . the amplitude of the @xmath78 signal predicted for the tangential configuration is slightly larger than in the radial case , but the difference is not very important and both slit orientations appear to be suitable for detecting the ly@xmath0 scattering polarization .    our reasons in favor of the radial slit option for a sounding rocket experiment such as clasp are the following . first , in the case of the tangential slit orientation we would have data only for a small interval of @xmath104 values , for example with @xmath135 at the central slit point ( where the polarization amplitude is the largest ) . obviously , any significant pointing error would compromise the measurement . in contrast , the radial slit option provides much more information on the clv of the scattering polarization signals , and having such clv data would facilitate reaching more reliable conclusions via detailed confrontations with radiative transfer modeling . note that with a @xmath118 radially - oriented slit one can have information from the solar limb till about @xmath121 . with the radial slit option such clv information would be available both at the line center ( where the hanle effect in ly@xmath0 operates ) and in the nearby wings of the @xmath78 profile ( where effects of partial frequency redistribution and @xmath136-state interference come into play ; see @xcite ) . as shown by these authors , having in addition information on the clv of the @xmath78 wing signals may help to constrain ( together with the observed stokes @xmath14 profiles ) the thermal structure of the upper chromosphere . another reason to prefer the radial slit option is related with the fact that with the clasp ( which will measure the ly@xmath0 radiation @xmath137   from the line center ) it will be difficult to determine with sufficient precision the zero offset of the linear polarization scale , and having the above - mentioned clv information may help to end up with reliable conclusions in terms of the hanle effect . clasp will be observing the solar atmosphere for approximately five minutes during which the structure of the dynamical tr will change to some extent . in our numerical experiments , we have only considered an instantaneous state of the solar model atmosphere corresponding to a particular snapshot of the time - dependent simulation . furthermore , we have assumed an infinitely narrow spectrograph s slit and we have neglected any possible drift of the slit during the simulated observation . because of the fine structuring and dynamical behavior of the solar chromosphere , clasp can not aim at determining the magnetic field at high spatial resolution . however , the lack of spatio - temporal resolution might actually help us to end up with observables useful to determine the mean field strength of the solar tr . therefore , the standard deviations shown in figs .  [ fig : bdet ] and [ fig : bdettara ] should be understood as being the most pessimistic estimates and the real observation will be of better accuracy . the outer solar atmosphere is a highly structured and dynamic plasma , much more complex than a uniform , plane - parallel 1d configuration . very likely , the height of the tr varies from one place in the atmosphere to another , delineating a highly crumpled surface ( e.g. , such as in the top left panel of fig . [ fig : jkq ] ) . strong spectral lines originate in this type of spatially complex plasmas , where the horizontal atmospheric inhomogeneities break the axial symmetry of the radiation field . this symmetry breaking produces changes in the scattering polarization signals , which may compete with those caused by the hanle effect . therefore , the interpretation of spectropolarimetric observations in chromospheric and tr lines requires solving a complex radiative transfer problem , namely the generation of spectral line polarization in realistic 3d models of the solar atmosphere . likewise , since the intensity profiles are practically insensitive to the magnetic field vector , the true way to validate or refute the models themselves is by confronting synthesized and measured stokes profiles , because the magnetic field information is encoded in the spectral line polarization .    in this paper we have extended to the full 3d case previous radiative transfer investigations of the scattering polarization in the hydrogen ly@xmath0 line , which were carried out using 1d @xcite and 2d @xcite models of the solar atmosphere . the 3d model of the extended solar atmosphere chosen for this investigation is representative of the physical conditions of an enhanced network region , with magnetic field lines that reach chromospheric and coronal heights ( see fig . [ fig : mgf ] ) . using the radiative transfer code porta developed by @xcite we solved the full 3d radiative transfer problem of the generation and transfer of scattering polarization in the hydrogen ly@xmath0 line , and carried out numerical experiments to understand its magnetic sensitivity due to the hanle effect . the first noteworthy point is that contained in fig . [ fig : jkq ] , which shows the radiation field tensors that quantify the symmetry properties of the ly@xmath0 radiation . the fractional anisotropy of the ly@xmath0 radiation ( see the top right panel ) is fully negligible throughout the whole photosphere and chromosphere , but it suddenly becomes significant ( of the order of 10% ) and predominantly negative right at the tr . that the model s tr practically coincides with the corrugated surface where the optical depth is unity along the los . ] the other panels of fig . [ fig : jkq ] show that the radiation field tensors that quantify the breaking of the axial symmetry of the ly@xmath0 radiation are also negligible below the tr ; i.e. , in the regions where the optical depth at the line center is larger than unity . as the optical depth at the ly@xmath0 line center becomes smaller than unity at the tr , such radiation field tensors become significant . as a result , the emergent ly@xmath0 radiation shows conspicuous scattering polarization signals , with sizable @xmath78 and @xmath79 line - center amplitudes all over the solar disk , even in the unmagnetized reference case .    at full spatial resolution the most likely fractional polarization amplitude is 1.5% for simulated observations at @xmath85 ( close to the limb scattering geometry ) , while it is 0.7% at @xmath84 ( forward scattering geometry ) . the polarization signals drop below the 1% level when the spatial resolution is degraded . for example , for a square resolution element of 3 arc seconds the most likely forward scattering polarization signal decreases by a factor two . in the limit of no spatial resolution we find that the clv of the line - center @xmath78 signal is qualitatively similar to that found in semi - empirical 1d models of the solar atmosphere , with the largest polarization amplitudes around @xmath85 and with @xmath138 at @xmath84 . although the average magnetic field strength of the model s tr is only @xmath139 g , the hanle effect in the hydrogen ly@xmath0 line ( whose critical hanle field is 53 g ) produces a significant depolarization ( see fig . [ fig : bsens ] ) . for stronger magnetic fields the ensuing depolarization is larger , until it reaches the hanle saturation limit for @xmath140 g . as shown in fig . [ fig : bdettara ] , for the radial slit case the @xmath141 line - center amplitudes are slightly smaller than in the tangential slit case , but they are equally measurable and show a similarly significant hanle depolarization . in section  [ ssec : tara ] we give our arguments in favor of the radial slit option when observing the ly@xmath0 scattering polarization with the clasp sounding rocket experiment . another important conclusion is that the hanle effect in forward scattering geometry ( i.e. , when observing the solar disk center ) does not necessarily create linear polarization in the presence of an inclined magnetic field , as it happens in the idealized case of 1d model atmospheres . the fact that in a 3d model of the solar atmosphere the radiation field that illuminates each point of the tr plasma does not have axial symmetry with respect to the local vertical direction implies that even in the absence of a magnetic field forward - scattering processes can produce significant linear polarization signals in ly@xmath0 . interestingly , we have found and understood that in such a spatially - complex plasma the hanle effect of an inclined magnetic field tends instead to destroy the forward - scattering polarization , as it happens when observing close to the edge of the solar disk where one reaches the case of @xmath142 scattering geometry . this and the previously summarized results are important for a reliable interpretation of future observations of the ly@xmath0 polarization produced by optically pumped hydrogen atoms in the chromosphere - corona transition region of the sun .    financial support by the grant agency of the czech republic through grant and project , as well as by the spanish ministry of economy and competitiveness through projects ( solar magnetism and astrophysical spectropolarimetry ) and consolider ingenio csd2009 - 00038 ( molecular astrophysics : the herschel and alma era ) is gratefully acknowledged . this research was also supported by the research council of norway through the grant `` solar atmospheric modelling '' and by the european research council under the european union s seventh framework programme ( fp7/2007 - 2013 ) / erc grant agreement nr . the radiative transfer simulations presented in this paper were carried out with the marenostrum supercomputer of the barcelona supercomputing center ( national supercomputing center , barcelona , spain ) . we gratefully acknowledge the computing grants , technical expertise and assistance provided by the barcelona supercomputing center . we are also grateful to the european union cost action mp1104 ( polarization as a tool to study the solar system and beyond ) for financing short - term scientific missions at the iac that facilitated the development of this research project .","The text discusses the radiative transfer of polarization in the hydrogen Lyman-alpha line (Ly@xmath0) in a 3D solar model atmosphere. The authors use the Bifrost code to simulate the 3D radiative transfer problem and solve for the polarization of the Ly@xmath0 line.

 the line - center polarization signals are sensitive to the magnetic field of the model s transition region , even when its mean field strength is only 15 g. the breaking of the axial symmetry of the radiation field produces significant forward - scattering polarization in ly@xmath0 , without the need of an inclined magnetic field . 
 interestingly , the hanle effect tends to decrease such forward - scattering polarization signals in most of the points of the field of view . when the spatial resolution is degraded , the line - center polarization of ly@xmath0 drops below the 1% level , reaching values similar to those previously found in 1d semi - empirical models ( i.e. , up to about 0.5% ) . 
 the center to limb variation of the spatially - averaged polarization signals is qualitatively similar to that found in 1d models , with the largest line - center amplitudes at @xmath1 ( @xmath2 being the heliocentric angle ) .

"microlens parallaxes measure a vector quantity , the `` projected velocity '' @xmath0 , which is the projection of the lens - source relative velocity on the plane of the observer . another way of writing this quantity is @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the lens - source relative parallax and proper motion . it is a useful quantity to measure because it depends only on the kinematic properties of the lens and source , and is independent of the mass . once it is measured , one can also determine the  projected einstein radius "" , @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the  einstein timescale "" ( which is almost always well - measured ) and @xmath6 . hence , an ensemble microlens parallax measurements can distinguish statistically between different kinematic populations . microlensing parallax measurements are feasible with _ spitzer _ toward two classes of targets , the large and small magellanic clouds ( lmc and smc ) and the galactic bulge . the science cases and technical challenges are substantially different for the two classes . the nature of the microlensing events detected toward the magellanic clouds by the macho @xciteand eros @xcite collaborations is unknown . they are definitely too infrequent to make up most of the dark matter , but could make up of order 20% . the basic problem is that , while a few of the lenses have special properties that allow their distances to be determined , for most lenses it is not known whether they are in the milky way ( mw ) halo , the mw disk , or in the clouds themselves . while it would be tempting to use the lenses with known locations to address this question , actually the very properties that allow their distances to be measured predispose them to be in the clouds or the mw , so they do not constitute a fair sample . it would be better to find a way to choose  typical "" events , not selected by any characteristic , and determine their position . _ spitzer _ has already been used to measure the microlens parallax of one lens . @xcite found that its projected velocity was @xmath7 , which is typical of halo lenses , but much bigger than expected for mw disk lenses and much smaller than expected for smc lenses . however , they also found that ( with no priors on the location or properties of the lens ) that it could be in the smc with 5% probability . thus , to draw rigorous scientific conclusions , it will be necessary to obtain parallaxes for at least 3 , and more comfortably 5 , such events . @xcite conducted a systematic analysis of what could be learned about lenses observed toward the bulge by obtaining parallaxes for an ensemble of them . they found that such parallaxes greatly enhance microlensing as a probe of the stellar mass function . for example , comparing the precision of mass estimates ( for lenses assumed to be in the disk in both cases ) , they found that without parallaxes the masses could be individually  measured "" with a @xmath8 precision of 0.6 dex ( so , essentially no measurement ) whereas with parallaxes , the uncertainty was reduced to 0.2 dex . of particular interest would be to measure the frequency of disk brown dwarfs ( bds ) . of course , bds can be directly detected , but only while they are young , so that inferences about their global frequency depend sensitively on both their history of formation and their assumed cooling properties . it would be nice to constrain their frequency based solely on their mass . the main characteristic of disk bds from a parallax standpoint is that they have small @xmath9 ( see eq .  [ [ eqn : retilde ] ] ) . for example , a bd with @xmath10 and distance @xmath11kpc would have @xmath12 . in order for an m dwarf with mass @xmath13 to produce the same @xmath9 would require a distance @xmath14kpc . this is much less likely , but of course not impossible . so an ensemble of measurements would be needed to estimate to estimate the bd frequency . in fact , as i will discuss in the   [ sec : bulgetech ] , parallax measurements are actually easier for lenses with smaller @xmath9 ( up to a point ) . spitzer _ is well - placed to probe this key regime . the technical challenges in the two directions differ significantly , although they are related . as mentioned , there is already one _ spitzer _ microlens parallax toward the clouds , which is a proof of concept . however , the source was an @xmath15 clump giant ( i.e. , quite cool , so large @xmath16 ) , which is what permitted excellent photometry with just 2 hours of integration time in each of the four measurements required . such microlensing sources toward the clouds are extremely rare ( this was the only one detected so far during the entire _ spitzer _ mission ) . to obtain the 35 events that are needed for the science goal , requires acceptance of more typical turnoff stars , which are both fainter and bluer , and hence demand integration times that are 1020 times longer . such integrations were prohibitive for cold _ spitzer _ but might be possible for warm _ spitzer _ when the observatory is under less severe demand . if we imagine an average of 60 hours per event for 4 events , this would take about 250 hours over 4 years . note that the individual exposures can not be made any longer than the 27 second exposures for the clump giant because of artifacts from very bright stars . here there are many challenges . first , because the bulge is near the ecliptic , it can only be observed for two 38-day periods per year ( in late spring and late autumn ) . moreover , the autumn window is almost useless for microlensing because no events can be discovered then from the ground . second , in contrast to the clouds , a large number of events must be monitored to obtain scientifically interesting results , close to 50 and preferably 100 . third , there are technical challenges related to reconciling ground - based and _ spitzer _ photometry . this is a classic problem first discussed by @xcite . basically , unlike trigonometric parallax , microlens parallax is actually a vector , @xmath17 , which is related to observations by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the measured difference in times of peak of the event as seen from _ spitzer _ and the ground , @xmath20 is the measured difference in the impact parameter , and @xmath21 is the magnitude of the earth-_spitzer _ separation vector projected onto the plane of the sky . the problem is that while @xmath19 can be robustly measured ( because the time of the peak can be read directly from the lightcurve ) , @xmath22 from each observatory is much harder to measure because it is a fit parameter that is partially degenerate with the amount of blended light . @xcite showed this degeneracy could be strongly constrained by arranging for the space and ground observatories to have identical cameras ( and so identical blending ) but that is obviously impossible for _ spitzer _ observations . @xcite evaded this problem by making _ responsible only for measuring the first component of @xmath17 : the events toward the clouds are long enough that the acceleration of the earth toward the sun ( roughly perpendicular to _ spitzer _ ) allowed ground - based measurement of the other component . however , most events toward the galactic bulge are too short to make this trick work .    in order to understand whether the first two challenges can be overcome , i plotted ( not shown ) , all 90 ogle events that peaked during a random 38-day period in spring 2007 , with events plotted in red before they were alerted and in black afterward . events must be alerted before peak or it is impossible to measure @xmath23 from _ spitzer_. the diagram proved to be quite a mess , but much of this mess is caused by 24 events that were alerted after peak because they are so faint . the remaining 66 events are shown in figure [ fig : ogle_poss ] . based on experience with _ spitzer _ observations of the smc event , it should be possible to obtain better than 1% photometry in one hour exposures of events that reach @xmath24 . ( the bulge sources are intrinsically bluer than the smc clump giant , but the fields are heavily reddened , so the _ observed _ @xmath16 colors are similar . ) there are 24 such events . hence , over 5 years , a sample of 120 events could yield measured parallaxes .    before addressing the challenge of aligning the photometry of the two observatories , one should take note of the bottom panel in figure [ fig : ogle_poss ] . it shows the earth-_spitzer _ separation projected onto the bulge , during each of the 5 38-day intervals of the warm _ mission , red for the first year and blue for the last . the average value is about 0.6 au , about 2.5 times the leverage available for the smc event @xcite . this is important because , until the projected separation gets to be the same order as @xmath9 , the signal - to - noise ratio of the measurement scales directly as the projected separation .    a possible approach to aligning the ground and _ spitzer _ photometry would be to obtain @xmath25 band images during the event from the ground with a high - resolution , large aperture telescope . such measurements would yield an accurate @xmath26 color , independent of blending . while @xmath27 is certainly not identical to _ spitzer _ @xmath28 m , it should be possible to use this color , together with the colors of other stars in the image , to align the two photometry systems based on stars of similar color . only empirical testing will determine whether this is a practical method . one potential problem with this approach is that there may not be enough bright bluish stars to perform the alignment for the ( typically bluish turnoff ) stars that dominate the event rate . in this case , one might be forced to stick with the brighter stars , which comprise 7 stars in the interval shown in figure [ fig : ogle_poss ] . even if it proves difficult to measure @xmath20 very accurately , it is important to point out that for one of the most interesting applications , the bd mass function , @xmath20 does not have to be measured with great precision . with typical @xmath29 and @xmath30 , measurements of @xmath20 accurate to 0.1 would be quite adequate . finally , there is the question of the practical organization of bulge observations . target - of - opportunity ( too ) observations are notoriously disruptive , and the warm _ spitzer _ mission is likely to have a lower level of staff support to deal with these disruptions than the cold mission does . however , given the very large number of observations required during each 38-day observing  season "" , it should be possible apply the concept [ originally developed for the _ space interferometry mission ( sim ) _ ] of a  regular too "" or rtoo ( as opposed to a  disruptive too "" or dtoo ) . for an rtoo , one plans in advance to make observations of the bulge for a designated set of times , but without specifying exactly what the targets are . then a day or so before the observations , instructions are uploaded to the spacecraft specifying the targets . if it really proves possible to measure 24 targets , and each one requires 7 1-hr measurements ( plus 1 baseline measurement that can be done at leisure during the autumn 38-day interval ) , then this amounts to 168 hours of observing over 38 days , or about 18% of observing time during this interval . all of these observations could be scheduled in advance , without knowing what the targets were .","**Microlens Parallax Measurements: A Summary**

Microlens parallax measurements are a technique used to measure the distance to distant galaxies and stars by observing the apparent shift in the position of a background object due to the lensing effect of a foreground object. This technique is useful for distinguishing between different kinematic populations, such as disk and bulge galaxies.

**Key Points:**

1. **Microlens Parallax**: A vector quantity that measures the projected velocity of a lens-source relative","because _ spitzer _ is an earth - trailing orbit , losing about 0.1 au / yr , it is excellently located to perform microlens parallax observations toward the magellanic clouds ( lmc / smc ) and the galactic bulge . 
 these yield the so - called `` projected velocity '' of the lens , which can distinguish statistically among different populations . 
 a few such measurements toward the lmc / smc would reveal the nature of the lenses being detected in this direction ( dark halo objects , or ordinary lmc / smc stars ) . 
 cool _ spitzer _ has already made one such measurement of a ( rare ) bright red - clump source , but warm ( presumably less oversubscribed ) _ spitzer _ could devote the extra time required to obtain microlens parallaxes for the more common , but fainter , turnoff sources . warm _ spitzer _ could observe bulge microlenses for 38 days per year , which would permit up to 24 microlens parallaxes per year . 
 this would yield interesting information on the disk mass function , particularly old brown dwarfs , which at present are inaccessible by other techniques . 
 target - of - opportunity ( too ) observations should be divided into rtoo / dtoo , i.e. , `` regular '' and `` disruptive '' toos , as pioneered by the _ space interferometry mission ( sim)_. lmc / smc parallax measurements would be dtoo , but bulge measurements would be rtoo , i.e. , they could be scheduled in advance , without knowing exactly which star was to be observed .",11462,519,1471,12.38 seconds,1.52 MB,0.27586206896551724,0.034722222222222224,0.1103448275862069,0.8110957145690918,medium
"since the concept of stellar populations was invented @xcite , stellar population synthesis ( sps ) has been proven to be a useful tool for revealing clues about galaxy formation @xcite . research on several crucial factors of stellar modelling , like convection , opacity , heavy - element mixing , helium content , and mass loss @xcite , resulted in increasingly accurate sps models @xcite . in this scheme , estimation of single burst equivalent age and metallicity , was accomplished by comparing integrated light of observed galaxy with that of sps models . however , most of the colours and absorption feature strength appear identical if the changes of age and metallicity satisfy @xmath2 . this so - called age - metallicity degeneracy @xcite blocks the way to estimating galaxy accurate ages from optical broad band colours . at spectroscopically narrow bands , however , several age sensitive or metallicity sensitive lick indices @xcite , taken in pairs , are effective at breaking this degeneracy . balmer indices vs. fe - peak indices are widely used , for example , because they are relatively easy to observe ( all features are in the optical so one spectrograph can cover them all ) and the model grids in the observed index -

infrared ( near - ir ) colours have been exploited to possibly constrain age and metallicity by several studies @xcite . @xcite suggested ( @xmath3 ) colour shows good balance between parameter degeneracy and sensitivity . @xcite found that four age intervals ( @xmath410 gyr , 2@xmath59 gyr , 1@xmath52 gyr , and 0.2@xmath51 gyr ) are clearly separated in the optical near - ir colour - colour plot . these results hinge upon the models , and specifically upon the number of thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch ( tp - agb ) stars , which dominate near - ir light between 0.3 and 2 gyr of age @xcite . the present work looks for age - sensitive or metallicity - sensitive indices in three photometric systems : david dunlap observatory ( ddo , @xcite ) , beijing - arizona - taiwan - connecticut ( batc , @xcite ) , and strmgren  @xcite systems . these filters are narrower in wavelength than johnson - cousins broad band filters , but resemble the _ nircam _ narrow filters on board _ jwst_. can we find indices which are practical to break the age - metallicity degeneracy ? the tables and graphs in @xmath6 [ sub : three ] explore this issue . in addition , equipped with the latest stellar evolutionary isochrones of the padova group ( @xcite , hereafter b09 ) , we plot the model grids in ( @xmath7 ) vs. ( @xmath3 ) space , and compare with previous models in @xmath6 [ sub : bvk ] . observables from three samples are chosen to verify the credibility of parameters given by the model grids . discrepancies between two model grids are briefly discussed in @xmath6 [ sect : disc ] , and a brief summary of the results and outlook for the future is given in @xmath6 [ sect : sum ] . in order to find the age - sensitive or metallicity - sensitive index , we calculate the the metallicity - to - age sensitivity parameter ( @xmath8 ) using the evolving ( * ? ? ? * hereafter w94 ) models , following @xcite and @xcite . the spectral library is synthetic and is sensitive to individual elemental abundances in the 300 to 1000 nm wavelength range . the metallicity sensitivity parameter is : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the metallicity partial derivative of the index at 8 gyr , and @xmath11 is the age partial derivative of the index at solar metallicity . thus , @xmath12 is the metallicity sensitivity at 8 gyr , solar metallicity . @xmath12 is surveyed for indices in three photometric systems . we refer the readers to related papers for detailed description of filters and indices ( see @xmath6[sect : intro ] ) . as shown in @xcite , indices with @xmath12 close to 1.5 are less likely to break the age - metallicity degeneracy . hence , indices with extreme @xmath12 values are selected as candidates and listed in table [ tab : ss]k , batc6075@xmath5k , were also examined . however , no promising index is found . ] . what is not quantified in table [ tab : ss ] is the dynamic range ( compared to observational error ) of a given index , and the dynamic range is low in ddo c(41 - 42 ) , alas . .metallicity sensitivities at 8 gyr , solar metallicity , for our best candidate pairs of colors [ cols="">,>"",options=""header "" , ]     in a non - solar scaled environment , indices may reflect those abundance changes . to trace the effects of different elements , we increase the stellar atmosphere model abundances of six major elements ( c , n , o , na , mg , fe ) by 0.3 dex , one single element at a time . the sensitivity is modeled only in the stellar library ; the isochrones are kept as published . table [ tab : eh ] outlines the index changes at 8 gyr , solar metallicity .    * the prominent carbon and nitrogen effect on ddo c(41 - 42 ) colour is not surprising , since the ddo 41 band overlaps cn@xmath13 and cn@xmath14 lick indices in wavelength . fe and cn absorption lines are the main features under 4000  , which explains the ddo c(35 - 48 ) colour changes at super - solar c , n , and fe abundances . the behavior of increased o is opposite due to molecular balancing : the co molecule has the strongest binding energy and so adding o decreases the c supply , weakening c@xmath14 and cn features . thus , adding more o causes bluer ddo c(41 - 42 ) and c(35 - 38 ) colours . * the batc 6075 - 6660 and 5795 - 6075 colours are relatively unaffected by six major elements , which makes them good colours to study systems with unknown element enhancements . what we find matches the basic philosophy of creating this photometric system : avoiding known bright feature lines and sky lines , in order to study the continuum of the spectrum @xcite . * strmgren  @xmath1 $ ] and @xmath0 $ ] are different from the four colours above , because they are the subtractions of two colours . @xmath1 $ ] is found to be metallicity sensitive in @xmath6 [ sub : three ] , which is consistent with its behavior in table [ tab : eh ] : five elements have substantial influences on @xmath1 $ ] . the trend of the @xmath0 $ ] index change due to c and o abundance variations is reverse compared to other indices . since @xmath15 and @xmath16 bands are both blanketed by cn absorption lines , our models predict that the impact of cn on the @xmath16 band is greater than that on the @xmath15 band . therefore , higher cn abundance means a larger magnitude increase in the @xmath16 band than that in the @xmath15 band , leading to a smaller @xmath0 $ ] value . the strong mg effect on @xmath0 $ ] is echoed by the mg3835 ( @xmath15 band ) and mg4780 ( @xmath17 band ) indices defined in @xcite . the possibility of breaking age - metallicity degeneracy with optical plus near - ir colours @xcite , and the upcoming era of near - ir telescopes ( eg : _ jwst _ ) inspire us to delve the optical near - ir colour@xmath5colour plot . prior to this work , @xcite inspected the ( @xmath7 ) vs. ( @xmath3 ) plot using ( * ? ? ? * hereafter bc03 ) , @xcite , and basti @xcite models . they suggested different treatments of convective core overshooting and differences in the tp - agb phase cause the inconsistency among different model grids ( also see @xcite ) . to further discuss the robustness of the models , we investigate the isochrones that looked so promising ( b94 ) and a later , even more complete version ( b09 ) from the same group . * b94 models + perhaps partly because of the inclusion of all stellar evolutionary phases , b94 models were widely adopted as basic stellar evolution isochrones for evolutionary synthesis models , such as : bc03 ; pegase @xcite ; and starburst99 @xcite models . figure [ fig : pad94 ] shows the ( @xmath7 ) vs. ( @xmath3 ) plot of b94 models . three observational samples are selected for comparison : ( 1 ) old , metal -

up , hot bottom burning , and variable molecular opacities @xcite . also , basic observables of agb stars in the magellanic clouds ( mcs ) were reproduced by the new models @xcite . the ( @xmath7 ) vs. ( @xmath3 ) plot of the b09 models are shown in figure [ fig : pad11 ] . observables are also plotted as in figure [ fig : pad94 ] . isochrones of age larger than 5 gyr are consistent with that of the b94 models . es and gcs locate on the metal - rich and metal - poor sides , respectively . however , isochrones of 1 and 2 gyr change substantially : the ( @xmath3 ) colour of @xmath22 becomes redder than that of solar metallicity . an unreported `` s '' shape is found if @xmath22 ssps are connected . another unexpected change is about the isochrone of the youngest age , 100 myr : the ( @xmath3 ) colour of the lowest metallicity ( @xmath23 ) is even redder that of the highest metallicity ( @xmath24 ) . prior to this work , @xmath25 or @xmath26 were paired with ( @xmath27 ) , ( @xmath28 ) , or other colours to estimate galaxy age @xcite . in this paper , the extinction independent q - indices @xmath0 $ ] and @xmath1 $ ] are assembled , but do a mediocre job breaking the age - metallicity degeneracy . as seen in figure [ fig : mc11 ] , several observables lie outside the b09 model grids . three reasons are hypothesized for these outliers : first , the conversion relations between _ uz , vz , bz , yz _ and _ uvby _ system presented in @xcite are empirical , which inevitably increases the uncertainty ; second , the dynamic range of @xmath0 $ ] index is not large compared to the observational error ; third , isochrones of age between 5 and 17 gyr are partially degenerate , which reduces the span of model grids . the model isochrone of 100 myr lies low in the @xmath0 $ ] vs. @xmath1 $ ] plot . this is similar to the statement in @xcite that most of the starburst galaxies have _ mz _ values ] less than @xmath29 , and they are well separated from other types of galaxies . to test the potential of @xmath1 $ ] index as an star formation rate indicator , s ( `` star formation rates equivalent to normal disk galaxy '' ) and s+(``starburst objects '' ) from @xcite are selected and shown in figure [ fig : mcs ] . most of the _ mz _ values of this sample are less than @xmath30 , supporting the idea that starburst galaxies are bluer in @xmath1 $ ] . however , we detect no clear @xmath1 $ ] value that separates es and star forming galaxies . strmgren  system photometry is far less developed than broad band photometry for galaxies , however . that , plus the large apparent observational scatter in figures [ fig : mceg ] , [ fig : mc11 ] and [ fig : mcs ] lead us to conjecture that strmgren  photometry may still have great potential for breaking the age - metallicity degeneracy , but higher quality data are needed to be certain . $ ] vs. @xmath1 $ ] plot of b09 models . the models are discribed in figure [ fig : mc11 ] . solar metallicity ssps are marked as _ filled squares _ to guide the eye . _ filled circles _ : s and s+ of @xcite . ] three sps models are assembled in this work : w94 , b94 , and b09 ( i.e. , primitive , competent , and sophisticated , respectively . ) . figure [ fig : mceg ] , [ fig : mc11 ] , [ fig : pad94 ] , and [ fig : pad11 ] clearly illustrate the model differences in @xmath0 $ ] vs. @xmath1 $ ] and ( @xmath7 ) vs. ( @xmath3 ) plots . during the whole work , we calculate the magnitudes of each bands in three sps models with the same codes , thus w94 , b94 , b09 models share the same spectral library , imf @xcite with lower mass limit @xmath31 , upper mass limit @xmath32 , and etc . most of the model grid discrepancies rely on different stellar evolution descriptions :    * w94 models are a merging of isochrones and tracks from many sources . compared to b94 , w94 models have a factor of two more stars in the upper rgb . the core - helium burning phase was approximated by a single red clump . the luminosities and lifetimes of agb stars were drawn from theoretical tracks . * b94 models included all phases of stellar evolution until the remnant stage in all mass ranges . convective core overshooting was also considered in the models . nevertheless , the analytic prescription of tp - agb phase was approximate . @xcite * b09 models adopted the latest tp - agb model of @xcite . compared with previous ones , this tp - agb model has included several crucial effects and it was calibrated by agb stars in the mcs . bertelli et al . reckoned b09 models as satisfactory achievement .    in figure [ fig : pad11 ] , ssps with @xmath22 have the reddest ( @xmath3 ) colours along isochrones of 1 and 2 gyr . this feature is not seen in b94 model grids . since b94 and b09 models mainly differ in tp - agb model treatments , which affect the near - ir colour seriously between 0.3 and 2 gyr @xcite , it is suggested different treatments of tp - agb stars are responsible for the changes of model grids . considering the metallicities of star clusters in the lmc ( mean @xmath33 for clusters with @xmath34 gyr and @xmath35 for clusters with @xmath36 gyr , @xcite ) , swb iv@xmath5vi star clusters are better fitted in b09 models  b94 models give much higher metallicities . nevertheless , noting that b09 models are calibrated by agb stars from the mcs , and that the metallicities of star clusters in the lmc are around @xmath22 , it is suspected that ssps of other metallicities , especially the extremely low metallicity , may not be well calibrated . the scarcity of very low metallicity agb stars around solar neighbourhood impedes empirical calibration . it is reasonable to suggest closer scrutiny for ssps with extremely low metallicities around 1 and 2 gyr . another unexpected feature in figure [ fig : pad11 ] is the twist of the 100 myr isochrone . this youngest isochrone is unique : the ( @xmath3 ) colour at the lowest metallicity is redder than that of the highest metallicity . this is inconsistent with the usual sense that metal - rich ssps are redder than metal - poor ssps ( see the 100 myr isochrone of figure [ fig : pad94 ] ) . the change of the 100 myr isochrones between b94 and b09 models challenge the method of estimating ages and metallicities of young ssps ( @xmath37 gyr ) from optical near - ir colour@xmath5colour plots @xcite .    finally , we check b94 and b09 model differences in the popular ( @xmath38 ) vs. ( @xmath39 ) plot ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * figure [ fig : brk ] ) . _ solid lines _ are isochrones of b09 models ; _ dashed lines _ are isochrones of b94 models . differences between two model grids are similar to ( @xmath7 ) vs. ( @xmath3 ) plots : ssps of @xmath22 have the reddest ( @xmath39 ) colours along the 1 and 2 gyr isochrones in b09 models ; the ( @xmath39 ) colour at the lowest metallicity is redder than that at the highest metallicity along the 100 myr isochrone of b09 . thus , these features are dependent upon near - ir band ( @xmath40 ) , instead of visible bands ( @xmath41 or @xmath42 ) . considering the tp - agb treament differences of b94 and b09 models and the tp - agb effects on @xmath40 band , it is again suggested tp - agb stars are responsible for the changes of young ssp isochrones ( @xmath43 gyr ) , which is consistent with @xcite and @xcite    ) vs. ( @xmath39 ) plot of b94 and b09 models . the b94 models are given at age@xmath18 gyr with @xmath19 , while the b09 models are given at age@xmath18 gyr with @xmath21 . note that the two sets of tracks are not identical . isochrones of b09 models are labelled by _ solid lines _ , and isochrones of b94 models are labelled by _ dashed lines_. solar metallicity ssps are marked as _ filled squares _ to guide the eye . a vector for a@xmath20 mag is sketched to estimate the extinction effect . ] motivated by the need of estimating ages and metallicities from photometric systems , this work explored the ddo , batc , strmgren  systems in the hope of finding age sensitive or metallicity sensitive indices . three index@xmath5index plots were examined but only strmgren  @xmath0 $ ] vs. @xmath1 $ ] plot showed moderate age - metallicity separation . four indices of the ddo and strmgren  systems changed substantially while increasing c and n abundances . o traces an opposite trend compared to c and n , since o tends to form co with c. then , we turned to the literature -

**Introduction**

Stellar population synthesis (SPS) is a technique used to create models of stellar populations, which are groups of stars that share similar properties. The concept of stellar population synthesis was first introduced by Xavier Citron (xcite) in the 1990s. Since then","in the study of galaxy integrated light , if photometric indicators could extract age and metallicity information of high enough quality , photometry might be vastly more efficient than spectroscopy for the same astrophysical goals . toward this end 
 , we search three photometric systems : david dunlap observatory ( ddo ) , beijing - arizona - taiwan - connecticut ( batc ) , and strmgren  systems for their ability to disentangle age and abundance effects . 
 only the strmgren  @xmath0 $ ] vs. @xmath1 $ ] plot shows moderate age - metallicity disentanglement . 
 we also add to the discussion of optical to near - infrared johnson - cousins broad band colours , finding a great decrease in age sensitivity when updated isochrones are used .

"in the recent years the quantum impurity problem out - of - equilibrium has attracted great interest . the most relevant realizations are the quantum dots connected to at least two metallic leads@xcite and short metallic wires containing magnetic impurities@xcite . in the impurity problem the exact methods play distinguished roles especially the bethe ansatz and conformal invariance . the generalization of these methods to out - of - equilibrium situations are the most challenging new directions . mehta and andrei are aiming to solve the kondo problem on a dot with two contact attached . first a simple resonant level without spin was studied to test the new generalization of the bethe ansatz method@xcite . their elegant suggestion is very provocative . in order to test this kind of new methods we perform a detailed study of that problem using different weak coupling perturbative methods combined with nrg . as the final goal we calculate the current flowing through the impurity when a finite voltage is applied on the contacts . the most challenging claim of mehta and andrei is that the current is a non - monotonic function of the strength of the coulomb coupling between the electron on the dot and conduction electrons in the two leads . in order to make the comparison more explicite we generalize the time - ordered scattering formalism for non - equilibrium in the next leading logarithmic order . in this way the current is calculated as a function of the applied voltage and the coulomb coupling strength . increasing the coulomb coupling strength we find also a non - monotonic feature but the order of increasing and decreasing regions is the opposite to the finding of mehta and andrei@xcite . the model to be treated is the following : a single impurity orbital is coupled to two reservoirs of fermi gas via hopping but the two reservoirs have different chemical potentials @xmath0 and @xmath1 on left and right of the impurity in a one dimensional model . @xmath2 is determined by the applied voltage @xmath3 ( @xmath4 is the electronic charge ) . the coulomb interaction acts between the electron on the impurity level and the conduction electrons at the impurity position . thus the hamiltonian has the form @xmath5 with @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the fermi velocity , @xmath10 is the creation operator of the spinless fermion in lead @xmath11 , while @xmath12 is the energy of the local level and @xmath13 is the creation operator for the electron on that site . the interaction term is @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the coulomb coupling which in a physical case @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 is the length of the chain . the existence of the substraction of @xmath19 is not essential , they can be omitted and than @xmath12 is shifted as @xmath20 and a local potential @xmath21 is acting on the electrons , but the latter one can be taken into account by changing the electron density of states in the leads at the position of the impurity . the hybridization between the lead electrons and the localized electron is described by @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the hybridization matrix element .    in case of equilibrium it is useful to generalize the model to @xmath24 reservoirs instead of @xmath18 , @xmath25 , and then @xmath26 runs through @xmath27 and @xmath28 . then the hybridization term in @xmath29 is chosen in a specific form @xmath30 indicating that only the electrons with @xmath31 are hybridizing while the others are taking part only in the coulomb screening . namely , only those electrons are hybridizing which have the symmetry of the localized orbital ( @xmath32-like ) . as a result of the screening the electron gas is polarized depending on the occupation of the localized state and that polarizations lead to orthogonality catastrophe@xcite .    the model with @xmath33 is known as a resonant level model and has been studied in great detail@xcite and the one with @xmath34 has been introduced to study finite range interaction in 3d@xcite .    the goal of the present paper is to provide weak coupling results for @xmath35 . but before doing that the @xmath36 equilibrium case is studied in the weak coupling limit by diagram technique and then to extend the results for stronger couplings wilson s numerical renormalization group ( nrg)@xcite and anderson - yuval coulomb gas method@xcite in order to check the validity of weak coupling results concerning a specific behavior . namely at some stage of the calculation in the exponent of the renormalized quantities a combination    @xmath37    appears . for @xmath16 that is changing sign at @xmath38 and that leads in changing the increasing to decreasing behavior but that crossover is well beyond the validity of the perturbation theory at least for @xmath39 .    in order to judge the real situation , an nrg study will be performed including the weak ( @xmath40 ) as well as strong coupling regions ( @xmath41 ) to get an insight whether the crossover indicated above is expected or it is likely artifact of the weak coupling theory . we also map the problem to a one - dimensional coulomb model closely following the work of anderson and yuval , where the screening can even be in the strong coupling limit . all of these methods are suggesting a coherent picture of the crossover and they agree very well especially for @xmath42 . the study of such a crossover is especially relevant as in the work of mehta and andrei@xcite such a crossover is suggested in the current flowing in the non - equilibrium case @xmath35 at @xmath43 . if we could find the crossover already in equilibrium then it is obvious to expect that in the non - equilibrium situation .    the paper is organized in the following way : in section  [ sec : weak_coup ] we provide the analytical perturbative method up to next to leading logarithmic order introducing extra channels for screening , where the non - monotonic competion of the vertex and self - energy correction is already demonstrated in equilibrium . in section  [ sec : nrg ] the equilibrium calculation is extended to strong coupling by using wilson s numerical renormalization group technique and the result is compared to that of the analytical calculation . in section  [ app : karcsi ] the anderson - yuval method is presented . in section  [ sec : out_of_equ ] the time dependent scattering method is applied for non - equilibrium closely following the generalized version of anderson s poor man s scaling in the next to leading order and the current is calculated . in section  [ sec : summary ] the results are summarized . in appendix a some cancellation due to ward indetities are discussed . the resonant level model is given by eqs . ( [ hs ] ) , ( [ h_0 ] ) and ( [ h_2 ] ) . that does not contain non - commuting terms , thus kondo behavior is not expected in the weak coupling limit . in the strong coupling limit that model , however , can be mapped to an anisotropic kondo model@xcite but that mapping is not considered here . the model shows strong similarities to the x - ray absorption@xcite , as the strength of the interaction ( invariant charge ) between conduction electrons and the electron on the impurity level is scale invariant . the system shows scaling in terms of reduction of the conduction electron band width , @xmath44 . in case @xmath33 the scaling equations were derived by schlottmann@xcite and those can be easily extended for arbitrary @xmath24 .    ) and crosses ( @xmath3 ) . in case of conduction electrons the channel indices are also indicated . ] there are two different kinds of vertex corrections depicted in fig.[fig : vertex_corr ] a , b , c , where the solid lines stand for conduction electrons , the dotted line for electron on the impurity level and the interactions are indicated by dots ( @xmath15 ) and crosses ( @xmath3 ) . in case of conduction electrons the channel indices are also indicated . the hartree - fock energy shift can be incorporated by @xmath12 . the self - energy of the electron on the impurity is depicted in fig.[fig : vertex_corr ] d. in the calculation of the self - energy counter terms are introduced to eliminate the constant terms to keep @xmath45 unrenormalized . closely following the earlier works @xcite , the invariant charge for the coulomb interaction takes the form @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the vertex function and @xmath48 can be determined perturbatively starting with 1 where @xmath49 is the renormalized one - electron green s function . the functions @xmath50 and @xmath51 are @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the conduction electron density of states , for spinless electrons in one of the channels @xmath54 . as the coulomb interaction is independent of @xmath55 , thus the factor @xmath24 occurs . as the consequence of the ward identity relating the vertex correction and the self - energy depicted in fig.[fig : vertex_corr]c and d cancel out in @xmath56@xcite @xmath57 thus @xmath58 . the renormalization group gives @xmath59 for arbitrary @xmath55 . the hybridization contains vertex correction for @xmath60 ( fig.[fig : v_corr ] ) @xmath61 but it does not contain linear contribution in @xmath62 in the order of @xmath63 . the relevant invariant charge @xmath64 is @xmath65 as the interaction is connected by only one impurity line . thus the terms linear in @xmath62 are    @xmath66    the result of the renormalization equation is @xmath67 the second term in the exponent appears as reduction of @xmath64 describing the coulomb screening in the @xmath24 channels .    for @xmath68 the @xmath64 interaction is always decreasing as @xmath69 is reduced but for @xmath16 it depends on the strength of @xmath15 . for large enough @xmath15 the screening dominates thus @xmath70 that behavior will be further discussed in sec.[sec : summary ] .    the scaling regions , however , are not unlimited as the impurity level has its own width , @xmath71 . there are two contributions to the level width @xmath71 . the hybridization broadens the impurity level just in case of the anderson model and that is in the second order in @xmath3 @xmath72 where also the effect of renormalization is taken into account . there is also a korringa like broadening due to the creation of electron - hole pairs thus @xmath73 , where @xmath69 comes from the phase space . that is important only for large @xmath69 where everything is smooth thus the broadening is not effective . the broadening due to the hybridization cuts off the renormalization procedure at energy @xmath74 . combining eqs.([eq : v_scaling ] ) and ( [ eq : gamma ] ) and inserting the condition given above provides the final @xmath75 value as @xmath76     for different channel numbers . the intermediate maximum can diverge only for @xmath77 , in all the other cases the increases are also rather moderate . ]    as shown in fig.[fig : v_ren ] , for @xmath68 @xmath78 renormalizes downwards and for even more negative @xmath15 down to zero . for @xmath16 and @xmath79 first @xmath75 increases with increasing @xmath15 but for @xmath80 it starts to decrease and tends to zero again . the intermediate maximum appears at @xmath81 . for @xmath39 that maximum is , however , already outside the weak coupling limit , where the calculation can not be trusted . the question still remains unanswered whether the non - monotonic behavior for @xmath16 can be traced in strong coupling calculation or not . the conclusions for the crossover might be trusted only for large @xmath82 , which does not have physical relevance . in order to determine the region of validity of the weak coupling approach in equilibrium , we have performed numerical renormalization group@xcite ( nrg ) analysis for the @xmath39 and @xmath42 cases .    in wilson s nrg technique after the logarithmic discretization of the conduction band one maps the original hamiltonian of an impurity problem to a semi - infinite chain with the impurity at the end of the chain . as a consequence of the logarithmic discretization the hopping amplitude along the chain decreases exponentially as @xmath83 where @xmath84 is a discretization parameter ( we have used @xmath85 throughout the calculations ) while @xmath55 is the site index . the separation of energy scales provided by the exponentially vanishing hopping amplitude allows us to diagonalize the hamiltonian iteratively to approximate the ground state and the excitation spectrum of the full chain . since we know the eigenenergies and eigenvectors of the hamiltonian , we can calculate dynamical quantities such as the density of states using the lehman representation of the spectral function@xcite . first let us focus on the physically relevant case of @xmath16 and @xmath39 . to compare the numerical data with the weak coupling results , we have calculated the impurity density of states for different values of the interaction strength @xmath15 . the results are shown in fig . [ fig : sp_func ] . the numerical data validates the weak coupling results for @xmath86 . in our nrg calculation we considered a flat band with constant density of states @xmath87 , where @xmath44 stands for the half bandwidth . in the lower panel of fig . [ fig : sp_func ] the renormalized value of the hybridization , @xmath75 is shown as a function of the interaction strength @xmath15 . in nrg calculation , we have defined @xmath75 from the finite size spectrum directly . the finite size spectrum as a function of iteration number crosses over from the initial fixed point to the strong coupling one characterized by single particle phase shifts @xmath88 at around @xmath89 . @xmath89 is determined by the renormalized hybridization , @xmath90 . we take @xmath91 when the energy of the first excited state exceeds @xmath92 of its fixed point value .     and @xmath93 as obtained by perturbative rg and wilson s nrg . the lower panel shows the renormalized value of the hybridization , @xmath75 as a function of the interaction strength @xmath15 . the numerical data supports the weak coupling results for @xmath94 . ]    to answer the question whether an intermediate maximum appears outside the weak coupling limit or not , we have performed calculation with very large values of the interaction strength up to @xmath95 . the results are shown in fig . [ fig : v_ren_n2n4 ] . our conclusion is that even for @xmath39 such a non - monotonic behavior is found but the position of the maximum as well as the shape of the curve for large @xmath15 differs essentially from those obtained by weak coupling calculation . it still remains a question whether for case of many channels the weak coupling calculation is reliable or not . to treat many channels with nrg is very challenging but to see the tendency with increasing channel number , we performed the numerical analysis of the case @xmath42 . the results are plotted in fig . [ fig : v_ren_n2n4 ] as well . our data suggests that already for @xmath42 the position of the turning point as well as the decay of the curve at large @xmath15 is reproduced by the weak coupling calculation with a much better accuracy than in case of @xmath39 .    0.3 cm   as a function of the interaction strength @xmath15 for @xmath39 and @xmath42 . , title=""fig : "" ] 0.3 cm in most of the physical cases the coulomb interaction @xmath15 dominates over the hopping term @xmath96 . to overcome that difficulty , anderson and yuval@xcite introduced a path integral method for the kondo problem where the interaction @xmath15 is described in terms of phase shifts while the hopping is treated as perturbation . the similarity between the kondo and the present problem can be exploited in the following way : the complex time axis is divided into intervals and as it is shown in fig .  [ fig : time_intvals ] where the solid lines represents the time interval when the impurity level is occupied and the light ones stand for unoccupied level . the conduction electrons can join the time line at the end points of the intervals where hopping @xmath96 takes place while they can touch the time line at any other points due to the coulomb interaction . those are indicated by dashed lines which are labeled according to the channel indices @xmath97 . thus the incoming and outgoing conduction electron lines should be connected all possible ways and finally a summation over all possible configuration of channel labellings @xmath97 must be carried out . 0.5 cm   takes place while they can touch the time line at any points due to the coulomb interaction . those are indicated by dashed lines which are labeled according to the channel indices @xmath97 . , title=""fig : "" ] 0.5 cm    some of the connections are indicated in fig . [ fig : time_intvals ] by dotted lines . the final result for the partition function can be given in analytical form as in refs.@xcite where the kondo or the two level system problems were treated . the partition function has the form of a one dimensional coulomb gas with appropriately defined vector charges @xmath98 ( @xmath99 ) . the scaling equations are derived by eliminating short time intervals at the short time cutoff @xmath100 with its initial value taken as the inverse bandwidth @xmath101 . the interaction @xmath96 must be also made dimensionless by a factor @xmath102 . the phase shifts for electrons in case of filled and empty impurity levels are : @xmath103 and @xmath104 , respectively . only their difference will appear in the scaling : @xmath105 . the phase shifts are limited : @xmath106 , @xmath107 . the friedel sum rule requires @xmath108 which expresses that the one electron difference between the filled and empty sites must be screened by charge oscillations formed by the conduction electrons . the hybridization can be associated with the fugacity @xmath109 the interaction can be represented by charges at the interaction points as @xmath110 where the index @xmath111 labels hopping in and out of the impurity level assisted by an electron annihilation or creation in channel  0 . the lengthy derivation of the scaling equations closely follows refs .  ) and the final result is @xmath112 or expressed in terms of phase @xmath113 ( phase shifts ) they are @xmath114 here the scaling is carried out by increasing @xmath100 to reduce the electronic bandwidth . the term @xmath115 in the first line of eq.([eq : sca_eqs_yz ] ) originates in the explicite factor @xmath116 in the definition of @xmath117 ( [ eq : fugacity ] ) and disappears from the corresponding scaling equation of @xmath3 . the system of equations eqs . ( [ eq : sca_eqs_yz ] ) must be solved for initial values @xmath118 but @xmath119 can be arbitrary . the fugacity can either increase or decrease exponentially depending on the quantity @xmath120 . similar expressions were obtained in ref . by matching the perturbative results with expression in terms of phase shifts . the regions for attractive interaction and large enough repulsive one will be treated separately . in the first case @xmath121 ( @xmath68,@xmath122 ) . the solution is @xmath123 thus @xmath117 is decreasing , therefore @xmath119 ( @xmath124 ) are slowly varying thus the @xmath100 dependence can be ignored . thus @xmath125    the situation is different for repulsive interaction ( @xmath126 ) . there are two regions in that case . in the first one @xmath127 and @xmath117 is increasing . then eq . ( [ eq : vscal_yuval ] ) is valid as far as @xmath128 is satisfied . there is , however , a crossover where @xmath129 to the second region where @xmath117 decreases again and the screening dominates . the larger @xmath24 the stronger the decrease is . the crossover between the increasing and decreasing regions is at @xmath130 as @xmath119-s are very slightly renormalized thus the unrenormalized values can be used and @xmath131 is independent of @xmath26 ( @xmath132 ) . thus the crossover is at @xmath133 and then for @xmath134 comparing with the results of nrg in case @xmath39 the turning point is at @xmath135 thus the agreement is not complete but at least it could be argued that it is inside the accuracy of the scaling equation . the weak coupling scaling result is very poor as it was expected ( see fig.[fig : sp_func ] ) . for @xmath42 all the methods give very similar results . the general solution of the scaling equations can be searched in the form @xmath136 . then @xmath137 the scaling trajectories are @xmath138 during the renormalization @xmath117 is fast increasing and the scaling is stopped where it reaches unity . meanwhile @xmath139 decreases slowly and its renormalized value can be extracted from eq.([eq : trajectory ] ) . the result in leading order in @xmath117 reads as @xmath140 outside that region the long time approximation for the conduction electron green s function can not be applied . considering theoretical methods two ways can be followed : the keldysh green s function method or the calculation of the scattering amplitude by time - ordered perturbation theory . here the second method will be followed , where the initial conduction electron states can be arbitrary non - equilibrium states and for the intermediate and final states the actual non - equilibrium distributions are taken into account . that method has been earlier applied in the leading logarithmic approximation@xcite , which is a generalization of anderson s poor man scaling@xcite .    here the extension of that method is presented to next leading order . for equilibrium first the kondo model was treated by that way @xcite . the basic idea is to calculate the development of the initial @xmath141 state to the final @xmath142 one , but in second order the renormalization of the norms of those states must be corrected also . thus the scattering matrix element to be considered is    @xmath143 t    { [ \langle f| % 1+[1/(\omega - h_0)]t \sum\limits_{n=0}^{\infty}\left(\frac{1}{\omega - h_0}h_{\rm int}\right)^n    \langle i| % 1+[1/(\omega - h_0)]t \sum\limits_{n=0}^{\infty}\left(\frac{1}{\omega - h_0}h_{\rm int}\right)^n    \label{eq : state_norm}\ ] ]    where @xmath69 is the initial energy of state @xmath141 and the hamiltonian is split as @xmath144 . in the present problem the correction of the normalization occurs for the impurity electron states while in the kondo model for the spin states . those normalizations appeared in the previous treatment as @xmath145 in eq.([eq : v_inv ] ) . the scaling equation can be obtained after changing the cutoff @xmath146 by adjusting the coupling constant to keep @xmath147 invariant for appropriate @xmath141 and @xmath142 . in the following we use the original left and right states ( @xmath148 ) with @xmath149 as a start . in order to derive the scaling for coupling @xmath15 the initial and final states should be @xmath150 where @xmath151 is the non - equilibrium state at applied voltage @xmath152 , for which disregarding @xmath3 the state is the noninteracting ground state . considering the occupation @xmath153 of the @xmath154-level the occupation probability in the steady state must be determined in presence of @xmath152 . that value will be @xmath155 for @xmath45 but in the general case @xmath156 it can depend on @xmath152 . the diagrams of the numerator up to @xmath157 order are shown in fig.[fig : ucorr ] ( i)-(vi ) where the diagrams should be decorated by the direction of the lines in all possible ways . the diagram of the self - energy is shown in fig.[fig : ucorr](vii ) . order contributing to the numerator of eq.([eq : state_norm ] ) . the diagrams should be decorated by the direction of the lines in all possible ways . the diagram of the self - energy is shown in panel ( vii ) . ]    in logarithmic approximation only the diagrams linear in @xmath158 are contributing to the scaling equations thus the relevant vertex corrections are ( ii),(v ) and ( vi ) while ( iii ) and ( iv ) are not as these provide @xmath159 . the type ( ii ) diagrams with the parallel and antiparallel lines cancel each other . as the logarithmic terms in diagrams ( v),(vi ) and ( vii ) come from closed electron loops which are independent of the actual value of @xmath0 and @xmath1 thus to the logarithmic term the left and right contacts contribute separately which should be independent of the applied voltage . that simplification is not sustained in higher order contributions where the left and right lines simultaneously occur . the self - energy correction in ( vi ) contributes by adding that to either of the incoming and outgoing @xmath154-lines . one of those corrections is cancelled by the denominator in eq.([eq : state_norm ] ) . as it is well known from the spinless fermionic case e.g. the x - ray absorption problem @xcite the remaining diagram is cancelled by ( v ) . thus single logarithmic term does not remain . that is similar to the equilibrium case , see eq.([eq : uinv_noscaling ] ) thus the invariant coupling @xmath160 . ( for the details see appendix a. )    in the following the renormalization of the hybridization depicted in fig.[fig : vertex_corr]b and [ fig : v_corr ] is crucial where e.g. @xmath161 and @xmath162 . keeping terms up to @xmath163 . after taking the denominator in eq.([eq : state_norm ] ) into account the final form of @xmath147 is    @xmath164    where the first correction is due to the vertex depicted in fig.[fig : v_corr ] , while the second one arises from the self - energy on the leg of diagram reduced by the denominator by a factor 1/2 . this result agrees with eq.([eq : v_corr2 ] ) ( @xmath39 ) at @xmath165 . here taking the special case @xmath45 the voltage @xmath152 serves as a low energy cutoff . as it has been mentioned earlier considering the @xmath154-level there is a steady state occupation @xmath153 . that value is determined from the ballance of the in and outflow of the conduction electrons . to determine it for @xmath156 two other quantities must be known , namely the changes in the level position and the spectral function of the @xmath154-level , @xmath166 and @xmath167 due to the applied voltage . that calculation can be carried out numerically in a self - consistent way . the probability of scattering of an electron coming from the left ( l ) or right ( r ) into the @xmath154-level is denoted by @xmath168 while the opposite process by @xmath169 . these quantities are @xmath170 and @xmath171 where @xmath172 are determined from renormalization group equations with the appropriate infrared cutoffs and @xmath173 is the fermi distribution function for the leads in presence of the voltage . those will be taken at zero temperature @xmath174 . the steady state is determined by @xmath175 this equation combined with eqs.([eq : w+])([eq : w- ] ) gives    @xmath176d\varepsilon } { \int\varrho_d(\varepsilon)\left[v_{l}^2(\varepsilon)+   v_{r}^2(\varepsilon)\right]d\varepsilon}\;. \label{eq : nd}\ ] ]    if electron - hole symmetry holds thus @xmath45 , then @xmath177 . the next step is to determine the self - energy of the @xmath154-electron . the @xmath154-electron propagator is @xmath178 which can be simply developed because the occupied @xmath154-level determines the time flow . the self - energy corrections appear also in the normalization . the effect of hybridization is just to give an extra broadening of the @xmath154-level to be considered later . without hybridization the self - energy is    @xmath179    which can be evaluated as @xmath180 and @xmath181 in the equilibrium calculation the term proportional to @xmath182 is contributing to the function @xmath51 in eqs.([eq : gamma_d ] ) and the last constant term @xmath183 is eliminated by the applied counter term to keep @xmath12 unrenormalized while @xmath184 is a korringa type of relaxation . to be noted that the voltage does not occur as the energy goes directly into the electron - hole creation of the same electrode . as we mentioned at the end of sec.[sec : weak_coup ] , that broadening is less important at small energies . the hybridization of the @xmath154-level gives the essential part of the broadening just like in the anderson impurity model @xmath185 where the voltage dependent hybridization strength must be used . the the @xmath154-electron spectral function is @xmath186 with the help of these quantities we are ready to calculate the current through th impurity : @xmath187 combining this equation with the expression of @xmath188 given in eqs.([eq : w+])([eq : w- ] ) the current takes the form    @xmath189 \varrho_d(\varepsilon)d\varepsilon\nonumber\\ -2\pi\varrho_0\int\left[f(\varepsilon - ev/2)v_r^2(\varepsilon)-f(\varepsilon+ev/2 ) v_l^2(\varepsilon)\right ] \varrho_d(\varepsilon)d\varepsilon\;. \label{eq : curr2}\ ] ]    the numerical calculation goes as follows : for a fixed value of @xmath152 we discretize the energy interval @xmath190 $ ] and calculate the renormalized hybridization @xmath191 and the impurity self - energy . the latter is evaluated in such a way that the renormalized @xmath154-level position zero @xmath192 . by performing a sum over @xmath193 we cab calculate at the level occupation @xmath194 and the current @xmath195 for the given value of the voltage . the result is shown in fig.[fig : current ] for @xmath196 .    0.5 cm , and @xmath197 . for this range of interaction strength the weak coupling method was reliable in equilibrium . , title=""fig : "" ] 0.5 cm    0.5 cm , and @xmath198 . note that the weak coupling result is reliable for @xmath94 only . , title=""fig : "" ] 0.5 cm    in that regime of @xmath15 the weak coupling rg gave good results in equilibrium ( presented in sec . [ sec : nrg ] ) therefore one expects reliable results in out - of - equilibrium as well . as it is shown in fig.[fig : current ] , the current increases with increasing interaction strength . the results can be interpreted as follows : with increasing @xmath15 the impurity spectral function gets broadened since the hybridization is enhanced . in the linear regime ( @xmath199 ) the @xmath15-dependence drops out since the increase of coupling to the leads @xmath200 is cancelled by the decrease of the height of the @xmath154-level spectral function which scale as @xmath201 . for larger values of the voltage @xmath202 the @xmath154-level is experienced not only at the peak of the spectral function ( @xmath203 ) thus the current is not linear in @xmath152 any more . for @xmath204 the complete @xmath154-level contributes to the current thus it saturates and the asymptotic value is proportional to @xmath200 . the resonant level model studied has very different behavior for attractive and repulsive interaction . this difference can be understood using the site representation for conduction electrons in the strong @xmath15 limit by the following argument :    \(i ) _ in case of attractive interaction _ the particle on the @xmath154-level attracts electrons to pile up around the impurity occupying the next site thus the electron on the @xmath154-level is blocked for hopping to the conduction band . \(ii ) _ in case of repulsive interaction _ the site next to the occupied @xmath154-level is empty thus that electron can easily jump to the conduction band . all the methods predict that increasing the strength of an attractive interaction the hopping rate @xmath3 is reduced and for strong enough coupling it even goes to zero ( see fig.[fig : v_ren_n2n4 ] for @xmath205 ) . the effect of orthogonality catastrophe reducing the hopping is less relevant because that have been already reduced by the vertex correction .    in the repulsive case for large @xmath15 the orthogonality catastrophe ( self - energy correction ) is reducing essentially the hopping rate . thus the effective hopping @xmath206 is first enhanced by the effect described above and can reach a maximum which is followed by a reduction due to the orthogonality catastrophe . the position of the maximum can be pushed to lower energies by increasing the number of the screening channels @xmath24 thus the perturbative result becomes more and more reliable . in case of @xmath39 the latter method leads to a pronounced maximum but the nrg indicates only slowly varying bump . in the anderson - yuval approach the maximum is even pushed to infinity . thus the existence of the maximum is supported only by the nrg .    considering the time ordered scattering formalism the results are in accordance with the expectation of the weak coupling result for @xmath39 . the increasing @xmath15 results in increasing current as first @xmath3 is increased but for larger @xmath15 due to the orthogonality catastrophe the current is essentially reduced ( see fig.[fig : current_decrease ] ) . as the nrg does not give a sharp crossover for the hopping rate @xmath206 thus the corresponding effect in the current must be less pronounced in reality . of course , for @xmath207 the crossover must clearly exist . unfortunately , in the work of mehta and andrei the crossover is in the range of reduced current , which is just the opposite what is expected on the ground of the physical picture established and results obtained by different methods for the hopping rate . very detailed further studies of the bethe ansatz method are needed to understand and resolve the origin of the presented discrepancies . the authors acknowledge the fruitful discussions with n. andrei , p. mehta , j. von delft , j. kroha , p. wlfle , p. schmitteckert and g. zarnd . this work was supported by projects otka d048665 , t048782 , ts049881 and t046303 . a.z . is grateful to the humboldt foundation to support his stay in munich . l.b . acknowledges the support of the jnos bolyai scholarship . contributing to the numerator of eq.([eq : state_norm ] ) . a ward identity ensures the cancellation of these diagrams for small frequencies meaning that no logarithmic term survives in second order thus the invariant coupling @xmath160 . ]    the diagrams of the numerator of eq.([eq : state_norm ] ) up to @xmath157 order are shown in fig.[fig : ucorr ] ( i)-(vi ) and the diagram of the self - energy is shown in fig.[fig : ucorr](vii ) . as noted earlier , the logarithmic terms come from diagrams ( v),(vi ) and ( vii ) . note that the self - energy correction in ( vi ) ( see also fig.[fig : app]b ) contributes by adding that to either of the incoming or outgoing @xmath154-lines . one of those corrections is cancelled by the diagram shown in fig.[fig : ucorr](vii ) ) in the denominator in eq.([eq : state_norm ] ) . therefore the two relevant diagrams are those depicted in fig.[fig : app ] . the contribution of fig.[fig : app]b can be written as          on the other hand , the contribution of fig.[fig : app]a for small frequencies can be evaluated and the @xmath154-electron lines indicated by arrows occur twice just like the denominator squared in eq.([eq : appdiag2 ] ) . that ward identity ensures the cancellation of diagram shown in fig.[fig : ucorr](v ) by one of the leg one in fig.[fig : ucorr](vi ) . this means that no logarithmic term survives in second order thus the invariant coupling @xmath160 . 99 see e.g. l.i . glazman , m. pustilnik , in `` nanophysics : coherence and transport , '' eds . bouchiat et al .

"the rapidity - gap events recently observed at hera @xcite revived the community s interest in regge - pole description of high energy scattering . the word ` pomeron ' seldom heard in recent years is once again found in the lexicon of experimentalists . it is perhaps then a good time to have a new look at the connection between perturbative qcd and regge pole . non - perturbative effect may be important for momentum transfer of the order of @xmath0 or smaller , but we shall avoid it by going to a larger momentum transfer if necessary . it was proposed by low and nussinov @xcite some years ago that the pomeron may simply reflect a two - gluon exchange in qcd . diagrammatic calculations have been carried out @xcite in the leading log approximation to substantiate this proposal and to study other aspects of the high energy near forward scattering amplitudes . we shall follow the classical approach of implementing physical ( @xmath1-channel ) unitarity by summing up feynman diagrams in the feynman gauge @xcite . however , other approaches are available . the use of physical gauge and dispersion relation @xcite can sometimes make things more transparent . one can also emphasize on the complex angular momentum aspect by concentrating on @xmath2-channel towers and their interactions as guided by @xmath2-channel unitarity @xcite . we shall speak no further of these alternate approaches except to remark that our cut diagram method , to be discussed below , can be thought of an intermediate link between the classical feynman diagram sum and the dispersion relation approaches .    due to the gauge and non - abelian nature of the theory , perturbative calculations are lengthy and complicated . even by ignoring self energy and vertex corrections , as well as renormalization effects on the grounds that they will not alter the qualitative nature of high energy scattering we are trying to learn , even by ignoring quark pair productions as a first step , a complete qcd calculation can be carried out only up to the 6th order . in the much simpler case of qed , an 8th order calculation @xcite was reported to have taken sixteen months and two thousand pages to complete . in the case of qcd , it is much worse , a complete calculation of the 8th order is not available , though partial calculations have been carried out @xcite . what makes the calculation so complicated is the large number of diagrams that has to be tackled , and the inevitable cancellations between them . the computation of each diagram is fairly straight forward , though somewhat lengthy at higher orders . after the individual diagrams are calculated , care must also be exercised to add them up because of the presence of many delicate cancellations . leading - log dependences on energy get subtracted away , complicated functions of momentum transfer also disappear . what emerges at the end is a product that is surprisingly simple . to the extent that it has been verified , high energy near forward scattering is described by multiple reggeized gluon exchange , supplemented by elementary gluon production off the reggeons and by @xmath1-channel unitarity @xcite . this outcome has been verified up to the 6th order @xcite . as mentioned above , many delicate cancellations take place in the sum to enable this simple picture to emerge . a complete calculation in the 8th order is not available , but if one assumes these cancellations which take place up to the 6th order also occur in the 8th and higher orders , then this reggeized picture has been verified up to the 10th order@xcite . this gives a strong support to the conjecture that it is true to all perturbative orders .    while the conjecture is attractive , it is impossible to verify or refute without a new method to simplify the complicated calculations . we report in this article such a new method , in which high energy scatterings are computed via _ cut diagrams _ rather than the normal feynman diagrams . these cut diagrams are _ not _ the cutkosky cut diagrams . the sum of all cut diagrams here is equal to the sum of all feynman diagrams , and not just their discontinuities . these cut diagrams can be regarded as a resummation of the feynman diagrams in which many of the delicate cancellations encountered in the latter have been built in and explicitly avoided . consequently , the simplicity of the final sum is revealed already in individual cut diagrams , and not masked by terms to be cancelled as is the case with feynman diagrams . besides , individual cut diagrams are easier to calculate than individual feynman diagrams . in this paper we shall introduce the formalism of cut diagrams , as well as an explict calculation to the 6th order to demonstrate its effectiveness . we shall discuss quark - quark scattering throughout but allow the quarks to carry any @xmath3 color charge . the result should be equally valid for gluon - gluon and other scatterings because high energy processes are insensitive to the spins of the colliding particles . we will study pure @xmath3 qcd and ignore the production of quark pairs . if one is bothered by considering quark - quark scattering while ignoring quark productions , one can consider instead gluon - gluon scattering , and as mentioned above , the result would be the same .    in a subsequent paper@xcite we shall use the cut diagrams to discuss the reggeization conjecture in higher orders .    in sec . 2 the result of feynman diagram calculations to @xmath4 is reviewed . how these diagrams combine to give a sum much simpler than the individuals will be discussed in some detail . in sec .  3 , we begin to examine more carefully these cancellations by using sum rules . in sec ,  4 , the method of cut diagrams is explained , and in sec .  5 , this method is applied to 4th and 6th order calculations to demonstrate the savings effected by this method . leading - log calculations in qcd , at high c.m .  energy @xmath5 and comparatively small momentum transfer @xmath6 , are discussed , among others@xcite , in the book of cheng and wu @xcite . citations to the original literature can also be located there . we review in this section the calculation of quark - quark scattering to the 6th order done in this standard way . -0 cm    3 truein    -2 cm.1 cm    the relevant feynman diagrams are given in fig . the 2nd order diagram is labelled a , the 4th order diagrams labelled b1 and b2 , and the 6th order diagrams c1 to c21 . this last labelling is identical to the ones used in fig . 12.7 of ref . @xcite@xcite .    under the interchange of the mandelstam variables @xmath7 and @xmath8 , the spacetime parts of these diagrams are either self conjugate , or one goes into another . for example , a@xmath9a , b2@xmath9b1 , c2@xmath9c1 , c15@xmath9c16 , c17@xmath9c19 , and c18@xmath9c20 , under @xmath10 .    normalizing the dirac spinors to @xmath11 , and designating the fermion mass and gauge coupling constant as @xmath12 and @xmath13 , with @xmath14 , the t -

dimensional vector @xmath25 in the transverse direction is the momentum transfer . the functions @xmath26 and @xmath27 are defined as follows : @xmath28 the functions @xmath29 are denoted respectively by @xmath30 in ref . the infrared divergences of these integrals can be regulated by a mass , either put in by hand or via the higgs mechanism . this regulation discussed in the literature [ 39 ] does not affect the following discussions so we shall ignore it . there is however also an ultraviolet divergence in the integral defining @xmath31 , but it turns out that this function disappears in the _ sum _ of the sixth order diagrams so it causes no trouble either .    the factors @xmath32 in ( 2.1 ) are the color factors , with @xmath33 for @xmath3 colors . as defined in @xcite , @xmath34 are respectively the color factors for the diagrams a , b1 , c1 , and c15 . they can be computed by an elegant graphical method @xcite from the @xmath3 commutation relation and identities    @xmath35=if_{abc}t_c\ , \quad f_{abc}f_{abd}=2c\delta_{cd}\ , \quad i^3f_{adg}f_{bed}f_{cge}=cif_{abc}\ .\end{aligned}\ ] ]    hence the combination of color factors @xmath32 given in ( 2.1 ) for the various diagrams remain valid whatever the color of the quark is , although @xmath32 themselves would be different for different color of the quark . see app . a for a brief discussion on the computation of the color factors .    the sum of all the terms in ( 2.1 ) , from @xmath36 to @xmath37 , is @xmath38 \!\cdot\!{\bf g}_1 + { 1\over 2 } g^2i(i_2 - 2\beta ci_3\ln s)\!\cdot\!{\bf g}_2\nonumber\\ & + & g^2i\beta\ln s\left [ i_3-{1\over 2}\delta^2i_2 ^ 2\right ] \!\cdot\ ! { \bf g}_3 + g^4{1\over 6}i_3\!\cdot\ ! { \bf g}_4\ , \end{aligned}\ ] ]    with @xmath39 it is important to note the various cancellations taking place to make the sum ( 2.4 ) vastly simpler than the individual terms appearing in ( 2.1 ) . for example ,    1 .   in the fourth order , the leading term proportional to @xmath40 is cancelled out between @xmath41 and @xmath42 in the color amplitude proportional to @xmath43 , though not in @xmath44 . 2 .   in the sixth order , the leading @xmath40 contributions to @xmath45 from @xmath46 to @xmath37 also add up to zero . the expressions given in ( 2.1 ) are not accurate enough to deal with the subleading terms . the term in ( 2.4 ) proportional to @xmath45 is obtained separately from the eikonal formula . 3 .   as a result of these cancellations , the energy dependence and the @xmath3 ( or @xmath47 ) dependence of the @xmath44 amplitude is @xmath48 , and those of @xmath49 are respectively @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 . these dependences can be summarized all at once by introducing a different notation for the color factors . we shall use the notation @xmath53 to denote a color factor with @xmath54 parallel vertical lines connecting the two fermions , and @xmath55 parallel horizontal lines joining any two of the vertical gluon lines . we shall also write @xmath56 simply as @xmath57 . the relations with the color factors @xmath32 are @xmath58 , and @xmath59 . the @xmath60 and @xmath40 dependences of @xmath53 in ( 2.4 ) are then given by @xmath61 for a diagram of order @xmath62 . we shall refer to such dependences as _ regge - like _ , for the reggeization of the scattering amplitude to be discussed later relies critically on this feature of the scattering amplitude . note from ( 2.1 ) that contributions from individual diagrams are not regge - like . only the sum is . simplification in transverse - momentum dependences also occur in the sum . the simple integrals @xmath63 survive , but the complicated integral @xmath64 and the divergent integral @xmath65 do not appear in the sum . this cancellation is highly nontrivial because both of them contribute different amounts to different color amplitudes . more specifically , 5 . the function @xmath66 appears in all the color amplitudes @xmath67 and @xmath45 in diagrams c15 to c20 . those in @xmath68 actually get cancelled out in the sum , but its presence in the @xmath44 amplitude survives . however , since this term is of order @xmath69 , it is negligible compared to terms of order @xmath70 appearing in the @xmath44 amplitudes of @xmath22 and @xmath71 to @xmath72 , it can be ignored in the leading - log result displayed in ( 2.4 ) . @xmath31 appears in the color amplitudes @xmath73 and @xmath74 in individual diagrams c1 to c14 and all these appearances get cancelled out .    as a result of these cancellations , @xmath16 acquires a very simple interpretaion in terms of reggeized gluon exchanges . these exchanges are constructed in such a way to ensure @xmath1-channel unitarity [ 3,7 ] . let us denote the reggeon propagator by @xmath75 this reduces to the ( transverse part of the ) ordinary propagator @xmath76 for small @xmath77 . similarly , let us denote the reggeized version of @xmath27 by @xmath78 indicating the exchange of @xmath79 reggeons . then to order @xmath80 in @xmath23 , we can write @xmath81   \nonumber\\ & + & { g^4\over 3!}r_3(\delta , s)\!\cdot\!{\bf f}_3\ .\end{aligned}\ ] ] in other words , the @xmath82 , and @xmath83 components looked precisely like diagrams a , b1 , c1 , and c15 respectively , but with the vertical gluons replaced by their reggeized version whose propagators are given in ( 2.6 ) , _ and _ with all longitudinal - momentum integrations omitted . to interpret it this way for @xmath84 we need to know the lipatov - dickinson vertex @xcite describing how elementary gluons are produced and absorbed from the reggeized gluons . this remarkable simplicity and regularity led to the conjecture @xcite that the reggeized formula ( 2.8 ) , suitably generalized , is the correct high energy limit to all perturbative orders . this conjecture is very difficult to verify on account of the shear complexity in higher order calculations . for qcd in the 8th order it is simply not manageable without simplifying assumptions . if one assumes all cancellations occured up to @xmath4 will also occur in higher orders , the final result can be extracted from a _ relatively _ small set of diagrams , then it is reported that this reggeization conjecture is true to 8th and 10th orders @xcite . even so these heroic calculations are so lengthy and complicated that to our knowledge the full details have never been published . we shall discuss in the next two sections a method of using _ cut diagrams _ to sum up the feynman diagrams , a method in which most of the cancellations discussed in the last section are automatically built in . this simplification shortens the computations and makes it possible to study higher order diagrams . in this paper we shall discuss how it simplifies the calculations up to @xmath4 . in a subsequent paper @xcite we shall discuss how it helps to verify part of the reggeization conjecture to all orders . to prepare for the grounds for both , we discuss here the relevant kinematical features of high energy scattering which enables this new method to work . we will assume the colliding beams in their c.m . system to be directed along the z direction . in lightcone coordinates , @xmath85 , the components of a four - vector are labelled in the order @xmath86 , with the two - dimensional vector @xmath87 lying in the transverse x  y plane . in this notation , the incoming fermion momenta are @xmath88 and @xmath89 , in which their mass @xmath12 has been neglected . the outgoing fermion momenta are approximately given by @xmath90 and @xmath91 . see fig .  1 . suppose @xmath79 gluons are hooked up to the upper fermion line as shown in fig . the initial and final fermions are on - shell but the gluons can be off - shell , though with an amount of energy far less than @xmath5 . at high energy , the numerator of the propagator can be approximated by @xmath92 provided the dirac spinors are normalized to @xmath93 . with that , the dominant current @xmath94 at high energy is just its translational part @xmath95 . this shows that the spin content at high energy is unimportant . all that it does is to enforce helicity conservation of the fermion , and to produce a factor @xmath96 at each vertex together with an overall normalization factor of @xmath97 . for most of the discussions below we shall ignore this qed factor and concentrate on the contribution from the denominators , _ i.e. , _ the corresponding scalar theory .    -.2 cm    3.2 truein    0 cm.1 cm    the denominator of the @xmath54th inverse propagator is @xmath98 where @xmath99 . the scalar amplitude in fig . 2 is given by @xmath100 times @xmath101\equiv -2\pi i\delta\left (   \sum_{j=1}^nx_j\right)\prod_{i=1}^{n-1}{1\over\sum_{j=1}^ix_j+i \epsilon}\ .\end{aligned}\ ] ] note that a momentum conservation @xmath102-function for the negative components ( together with an explicit factor @xmath103 ) has been incorporated . in eq . ( 3.3 ) the ordering of the gluon lines from left to right is @xmath104 $ ] . if they are ordered differently , say @xmath105\equiv v$ ] , then the corresponding amplitude is @xmath106\equiv a[v ] \equiv -2\pi i\delta\left (    \sum_{j=1}^nx_{v_j}\right)\cdot\prod_{i=1}^{n-1}{1\over\sum_{j=1}^ix _ { v_j } + i \epsilon}\ .\end{aligned}\ ] ] it is possible to compute sums of feynman diagrams without much of the delicate cancellations discussed in sec .  2 , by using the _ cut diagrams _ which we shall describe in this section and the next . the derivation of cut diagrams relies on two exact combinatorial formulas for the quantity @xmath107 $ ] in ( 3.4 ) : the _ factorization formula _ and the _ multiple commutator formula _ derived in ref . we shall discuss the former in this section , and the latter in the next section . consider an ordering of @xmath108 gluon lines : @xmath109\equiv v_i$ ] . we shall use the notation @xmath110 to denote the _ set _ of _ all _ orderings of the @xmath111 gluon lines , _ provided _ the relative orderings of lines within each @xmath112 are maintained . the number of orderings in this set is given by the multinominal coefficient @xmath113 . for example , if @xmath114 , v_2=[24]$ ] , then @xmath115 consists of the @xmath116 orderings [ 13524 ] , [ 13254 ] , [ 13245 ] , [ 12354 ] , [ 12345 ] , [ 12435 ] , [ 21354 ] , [ 21345 ] , [ 21435 ] , and @xmath117 $ ] . we shall use the notation @xmath118\end{aligned}\ ] ] to denote the sum of all amplitudes for the gluon orderings in the set . the factorization formula @xcite then states that @xmath119\ \end{aligned}\ ] ] in particular , if each set @xmath120 $ ] consists of only one gluon line labelled by @xmath121 , then @xmath122 is the set of _ all _ orderings of the @xmath12 gluon lines . in that case the factorization formula reduces to the well - known _ eikonal formula _ other special cases of this formula have also been discovered before@xcite . it is useful to adopt an alternative notation for the right hand side of ( 4.2 ) to denote @xmath123 $ ] simply as @xmath124 $ ] . this notation is suggestive because the vertical bar can be interpreted graphically as a cut in the fermion propagator between the last gluon line of @xmath112 and the first gluon line of @xmath125 . for a cut propagator , instead of the usual factor @xmath126 , we have @xmath127 . this notation is also convenient because it makes ( 4.2 ) deceptively simple . it now reads @xmath128 $ ] ; we simply have to change the semicolons to vertical bars . cut propagators are not limited to tree diagrams like fig .  2 . the offshell gluons can be connected to other diagrams to form a composite diagram that inherits the original cuts . the cut diagrams so formed are similar to but different from the cutkosky cut diagrams . similar because we have the same factors for the cut propagators . different because the cuts here occur only on fermion lines whereas in a cutkosky diagram they can occur on any line . moreover , via ( 4.2 ) , our cut diagram represents a sum of @xmath113 ( uncut ) feynman diagrams , with their real and imaginary parts fully included , which is unlike the cutkosky diagrams in which only the imaginary part or the discontiuity is represented . it is clear from ( 4.2 ) that the factorization formula can be thought of as a sum rule , to represent sums of feynman diagrams as cut diagrams . as will be discussed in appendix b , a cut diagram is easier to compute than an uncut diagram . in this way not only it is unnecessary to compute the individual diagrams first , the cut diagram representing the sum is actually easier to compute than just one single feynman diagram . we shall now apply the factorization formula to compute sums of amplitudes quoted in sec .  2 . we shall see that the @xmath40 factor and the @xmath129 functions that get cancelled out in the sum never once appear in the cut diagrams .    in what follows we shall use the notation @xmath130 to denote the spacetime part of @xmath41 ( without the color factor @xmath43 ) . similar notation will be used for the spacetime part of other diagrams as well . -.3 cm    3.0 truein    -0 cm.2 cm    in the 4th order , the @xmath43 coefficient in @xmath16 is given by @xmath131 . using the eikonal formula @xmath132+a[21]=a[1|2]$ ] on the upper fermion line ( see fig . 3 ) , @xmath131 is reduced to a cut diagram that can be easily calculated ( see appendix b for all the calculations ) , yielding the correct result @xmath133 given in ( 2.1 ) and ( 2.4 ) . similary , the sum rule @xmath134 $ ] applied to the six horizontal ladder diagrams in the 6th order , yields a cut diagram ( see fig . 4 ) which gives the sum of @xmath135 to @xmath136 to be @xmath137 . this is the correct coefficient of @xmath45 given in ( 2.4 ) . note that neither @xmath40 nor @xmath64 ever appears . -0 cm    3 truein    0 cm.1 cm    -0 cm    2.7 truein    0 cm.1 cm -0 cm    3.7 truein    .1 cm.3 cm    let us now look at the cancellation of @xmath66 in the @xmath43 and @xmath74 color factors , as discussed in point ( 5 ) of sec .  2 . according to ( 2.1 ) , the coefficient of @xmath138 from diagrams c15 to c20 is given by @xmath139 . using @xmath140 $ ] on the upper fermion line as in fig .  5 , this sum is given by a cut diagram which can be evaluated to be @xmath141 . again @xmath64 does not appear in the cut diagram . similarly , the coefficient of @xmath142 from diagrams c15 to c20 is given by ( 2.1 ) to be @xmath143 . this is equal to twice the previous sum , plus @xmath144 . to use the sum rule , this requires an expression ( see fig . 6 ) for @xmath145+a[213]+a[132]$ ] . it is easy to see that this is equal to @xmath146 , and by the factorization formula , also equal to @xmath147-a[23|1]+a[13|2]$ ] . there may seem to be very little gained by replacing the sum of three terms by the sum of another three terms , but this is not so . we are replacing the sum of three uncut diagrams by the sum of three cut diagrams . the computation of cut diagrams is much easier than the computation of uncut diagrams . for one thing the complicated function @xmath64 that appears on all the three uncut diagrams but disappears from their sum never appears in any of the three cut diagrams . evaluating the cut diagrams , the coefficient of @xmath142 from c15 to c20 is @xmath148 , agreeing with the answer given in ( 2.4 ) . the method introduced in the last section has a serious shortcoming . it does not tell us which cut diagrams to compute without detailed considerations of the kind carried out there . in this section we discuss a remedy for this shortcoming with the help of the _ multiple commutator formula _ [ 12 ] . so far we have been treating fig .  2 mostly as a qed or a scalar amplitude . for qcd the non - abelian color matrices @xmath149 have to be incorporated . instead of ( 3.4 ) the amplitude is now @xmath150=a[v_1v_2\cdots v_n]t[v_1v_2\cdots v_n ] \equiv a[v]t[v]\equiv a[v]\ , \end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath151=t_{v_1}t_{v_2}\cdots t_{v_n}$ ] . what we want is a formula for the sum of the @xmath152 permuted gluon orderings , @xmath153 $ ] . for qed , where we can take all @xmath154 , this is simply the eikonal formula , so what we need is the non - abelian generalization of it . this is the multiple commutator formula @xmath155t[v]=\sum_{v\in s_n}a[v_c]t[v_c']\ .\end{aligned}\ ] ] it expresses the sum of @xmath107t[v]$ ] in terms of sums over the corresponding cut amplitude @xmath156t[v_c']$ ] . compared to the eikonal formula this looks complicated ; instead of a single term on the right hand side we have now a sum over @xmath152 terms . the complication is inevitable because we are attempting to sum up amplitudes for _ every _ color . however , we shall see that many of these terms are actually zero , and moreover , the cut diagrams on the right are considerably simpler to evaluate than the uncut diagrams on the left . again delicate cancellations will largely be avoided as before . what remains to be described is what the cut diagram @xmath157 that corresponds to the feynman diagram @xmath158 is , as well as what the amplitudes @xmath156 $ ] and @xmath159 $ ] are . given a @xmath160 $ ] , start from the rightmost number @xmath161 and proceed leftward until one comes to the first number less than @xmath161 . put a cut just to the right of this number . then start from this number and proceed leftward again until one comes to the first number that is less than this number , and another cut is put just to the right of this new minimum number . continue this way until the end and we have constructed the cut diagram @xmath157 . for example , for @xmath162 , the 2 cut diagrams are @xmath163_c=[1|2]$ ] and @xmath164_c=[21]$ ] . for @xmath165 , the six cut diagrams are @xmath166_c=[1|2|3]$ ] , @xmath167_c=[21|3]$ ] , @xmath168_c=[31|2]$ ] , @xmath169_c=[1|32]$ ] , @xmath170_c=[231]$ ] , and @xmath171_c=[321]$ ] .    to each cut diagram we associate a spacetime cut amplitude @xmath156 $ ] as described in the last section . namely , it is given by ( 3.4 ) except the propagator at a cut is replaced by @xmath172 . the complementary diagram @xmath173 of a cut diagram @xmath157 is obtained as follows . if a cut appears between two numbers in @xmath157 , then there will be no cut between the same two numbers in @xmath173 , and vice versa . for @xmath162 , the complementary cut diagrams are @xmath174'=[12]$ ] and @xmath164'=[2|1]$ ] . for @xmath165 , the complementary cut diagrams are @xmath175'=[123]$ ] , @xmath176'=[2|13]$ ] , @xmath177'=[3|12]$ ] , @xmath178'=[13|2]$ ] , @xmath170'=[2|3|1]$ ] , and @xmath171'=[3|2|1]$ ] . when no cut appears in @xmath173 the color factor @xmath159 $ ] is simply @xmath179=t_{v_1}t_{v_2}\cdots   t_{v_n}$ ] . if a cut appears between @xmath121 and @xmath180 , then the product @xmath181 is replaced by their commutators @xmath182 $ ] . if two or more consecutive cuts appears , then the corresponding product of @xmath2 s is replaced by multiple commutators . for example , @xmath183=[t_2,t_1]t_3 $ ] , @xmath184=[t_2,[t_3,t_1]]$ ] , and @xmath185=[t_4,[t_3,[t_2,t_1]]]t_5 $ ] . we shall compute the cut diagrams to @xmath4 to demonstrate the simplifications obtained therefrom . -0 cm    3.7 truein    0 cm.1 cm    using ( 5.2 ) on the upper fermion , we obtain a set of cut diagrams as shown in fig .  7 . this set is not unique as others can be obtained from a different labelling of the gluon lines .    in the horizontal ladder diagrams b1 , b2 , c15c20 , we choose the planar diagrams b1 and c15 to be the ones whose upper lines are completely cut . this fixes the labelling [ 12 ] for b1 and [ 123 ] for c15 as shown , and it in turn determines how diagrams b2 and c16 to c20 are to be cut . using computational methods discussed in app . a and b , these diagrams yield    @xmath186    similarly , we choose to cut the line of the planar diagram c1 to obtain @xmath187 \!\cdot\!{\bf g}_3&\nonumber\\ \overline{c2}_c&=-\beta^2({\ln^2s})\left [ { 1\over 2 } \delta^2i_2 ^ 2-j_2i_2\right ] \!\cdot\!c^2{\bf g}_1&\end{aligned}\ ] ]    the twelve diagrams c3 to c20 can be divided into four groups of three , each giving identical contributions , so it is necessary to consider only one of these groups . the group of c3 , c7 , c12 have been chosen for that purpose . there is a symmetry between gluon lines 2 and 3 so we may double this group and consider it as a sum of six feynman diagrams . by applying the multiple commutator formula , the six cut diagrams shown in fig .  7 are obtained . their values are @xmath188 the expressions in ( 6.1)(6.3 ) should be compared with those of the uncut diagrams , eq . it should also be compared with the sum found in eq .  ( several points can be noted from these comparisons :    1 . @xmath40 factors that get cancelled in the sum of the feynman amplitude ( see points ( 1 ) to ( 3 ) in sec . 2 ) never even appear in ( 6.1)(6.3 ) . cancellation of this kind is automatically built into the cut diagram formalism . 2 .   the tranverse function @xmath64 appears only in @xmath189 in eq . this expression survives the sum but can be ignored compared to the contribution from @xmath190 . in other words , as opposed to the feynman amplitude ( 2.1 ) where @xmath64 appears in many places but most of them are cancelled out at the end ( see points ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) in sec . 2 ) , in the cut amplitude @xmath64 does not appear except when it survives the sum . the cut amplitude is not as successful in cancelling the transverse function @xmath65 ( point ( 6 ) of sec . 2 ) , although there is still an imporvement here over ( 2.1 ) in that @xmath65 appears in fewer places . in fact , it appears in @xmath191 to @xmath192 only when absolutely needed to cancel its previous appearance in @xmath193 and @xmath190 . in order for @xmath65 to disappear completely it is necessary to combine diagrams with triple and four gluon vertices together using the lipatov - dickinson vertex @xcite . the technique of cut diagrams by itself , which deals mainly with the fermion lines , is not sufficient for that purpose . 4 .   other than the @xmath65 complication mentioned above , the summands of the final answer ( 2.4 ) appear directly in the cut amplitudes . in that sense the cut amplitudes are as economical and as simple as they can ever be . in particular , the regge - like feature mentioned in point ( 3 ) of sec .  2 is present already in individual cut diagrams . this research is supported in part by the by the natural science and engineering research council of canada , and the fonds pour la formation de chercheurs et laide  la recherche of qubec . yjf acknowledges the support of the carl reinhart foundation , and ohr thanks the ministry of culture and higher education of iran for financial support . the method to compute the color factors graphically @xcite is briefly reviewed here . it is suitable for both cut and uncut diagrams . -0 cm    2.7 truein    -0.5 cm.3 cm    the basic tool is the graphical identities depicted in figs . 8 and 9 , which are nothing but the commutation relation and identities in ( 2.3 ) . the commutation relation is valid for all representations of the color matrix @xmath149 , hence fig . 8 remains true when the quark line is replaced by a gluon line . -0.3 cm    3.2 truein    -.5 cm.1 cm    -1 cm    3.2 truein    -.8 cm.1 cm    as an example , the computation of the color factor for the uncut diagram c19 in eq . ( 2.1 ) is carried out in fig . 10 , and the computation of the color factor for the cut diagram c19@xmath194 in eq . ( 6.1 ) is carried out in fig . 11 . for the latter , we have to remember to use the _ complementary _ cut diagram for the color factor , and not the cut diagram itself shown in fig . 0 cm    3.5 truein    0 cm.2 cm    the color factors in eqs . ( 2.1 ) , ( 6.1)(6.3 ) can all be obtained in this way . high energy limit of a feynman diagram can be computed either in the feynman - parameter representation@xcite , or directly in momentum space using lightcone coordinates@xcite . we follow the latter approach and review briefly the main points . for a more detailed discussion see ref . it serves well to remember at this point that the bottom fermion carries mostly the ` @xmath195 ' momentum and the top fermion line carries mostly the ` @xmath196 ' momentum . the procedure to follow for the computation is simple : ( i ) carry out the ` @xmath196 ' momentum integration using residue calculus ; ( ii ) then carry out the ` @xmath195 ' momentum integration to produce the @xmath40 dependence . the transverse momentum integrations are never explicitly carried out , which is why the answers are all expressed in terms of functions like @xmath27 and @xmath26 given in eq . ( 2.2 ) .          step ( i ) requires a knowledge of the location of poles for each propagator , which in turn depends on the choice of loop momenta @xmath197 . suppose @xmath198 is the momentum flowing through a propagator , with @xmath199 being some combination of external momenta and @xmath200 some integer coefficients . the propagator @xmath201 has a pole in the integration variable @xmath202 if @xmath203 . this pole is located in the upper half plane if @xmath204 is negative , and in the lower half plane if it is positive . a way to keep track of the sign is to draw a _ flow diagram _ for the ` @xmath195 ' momentum , with arrows indicating the direction of the ` @xmath195 ' flow . see fig . 12 for some illustrative examples . the arrows around a loop pointing one way ( clockwise or counter clockwise ) have their poles in one half plane , and those pointing the other way have poles in the opposite half plane . the arrows in the flow diagrams must obey momentum conservation , and one may also assume they do not go around in closed loops . otherwise the poles will all be in the same half plane , and the integral is zero if the contour is closed in the opposite half plane . with these constraints we see in fig . 12 that a one - loop diagram allows only one flow path , but for two and more loops there is bound to be more than one flow diagrams because these constraints simply can not fix the direction of the ` @xmath195 ' flow on a boundary line of two loops . we shall always close integration contours in the lower half planes , and indicate the poles so enclosed by a cross ( x ) in the flow diagram . for a _ diagram , the @xmath23-matrix element is equal to the product of @xmath206 propagators @xmath207 , integrated over the @xmath208 loop momenta @xmath209 , with an extra numerical factor @xmath210^\ell$ ] . each ` @xmath196 ' integration produces a factor @xmath103 , the @xmath23-matrix is equal to @xmath211 where @xmath212 is the scaled ` @xmath195 ' momenta , @xmath213 is the measure for transverse momentum integration , and @xmath214 is either the propagator evaluated at the x poles or the residue of the x pole divided by @xmath5 . each summand in ( b1 ) corresponds to a flow diagram with a pole taken from the lower half plane ( an x pole ) of each loop . a flow diagram may have more than one set of x poles , in which case the sum is taken over all possible sets . for example , the one - loop diagram b1 in fig . 1 has only one flow path ( fig . 12(a ) ) and one set of x poles . the two - loop diagram c17 of fig .  1 has two flow paths , figs . 12(b ) and 12(c ) . the first flow diagram has two sets of x poles , and the latter flow diagram has one set of x poles . we shall see later that in the leading log approximation , we may discard the @xmath215 dependence on the upper fermion line and the accompanied poles , in which case 12(b ) is also left with one set of x poles . let @xmath217 . every @xmath218 is a linear combination of @xmath219 , and in the case of a propagator along the bottom fermion line , @xmath220 is also involved . the sign of each @xmath218 is fixed by the direction of arrows in the flow diagram . if there are @xmath221 cut lines , then the last @xmath221 @xmath219 will be chosen to be equal to @xmath222 of these cut lines . the @xmath206 indices @xmath54 will now be divided into three sets , @xmath223 for indices from 1 to @xmath208 labelling the internal lines with an x pole , @xmath224 for indices labelling propagators on the top fermion line , and @xmath12 for the rest . then @xmath225 , and @xmath226 can be expressed as linear combinations of @xmath227 , _ @xmath228 within the leading log approximation , one has @xmath229 the ` @xmath195 ' momentum flows mainly along the bottom fermion line , with very little seeping out to avoid a substantial mixing with the ` @xmath196 ' momentum coming from the top fermion line , for a finite mixture of these two at a propagator would make it proportional to @xmath1 and therefore negligible . this means the dominant contribution to @xmath23 comes from regions where all @xmath219 are small . since @xmath230 for @xmath231 , on account of the @xmath102-functions of the cut lines , the region of ` @xmath195 ' integration can be roughly divided into regions where the remaining @xmath232 @xmath219 s are strongly ordered , and regions where two or more of these @xmath219 s are of the same order of magnitude . we shall label any one of the latter regions by @xmath233 , and the former regions by @xmath234=\{1\gg x_1\gg x_2\gg\cdots \gg x_\ell'\ge a / s\}$ ] and its permutations . the @xmath235-dependence of @xmath236 in @xmath234 $ ] is of the form @xmath237 , so the @xmath235-integral encountered in ( b1 ) is @xmath238 where @xmath239 and @xmath240 is determined by how many times the sum @xmath241 reaches zero by varying @xmath242 from 1 to @xmath243 . clearly @xmath244 , and the only way for @xmath245 is to have all @xmath246 , in which case we will call the @xmath40 dependence of @xmath23 _ saturated_. otherwise it is said to be _ unsaturated_. for the uncut diagrams , @xmath247 and @xmath248 . we see in ( 2.1 ) that all the diagrams except for the 6th order horizontal ladder diagrams c15 to c20 are saturated . for the cut diagrams in ( 6.1 ) to ( 6.3 ) , only @xmath189 is unsaturated , but this diagram does not contribute to the final sum because of its subdominance . the integral in an @xmath233 region is like one in an @xmath249 region with @xmath243 reduced . for example , suppose @xmath250 to @xmath251 are roughly equal but @xmath252 to @xmath253 ( @xmath254 ) are strongly ordered as in @xmath255=r''$ ] . then the volume element in the last three variables in spherical coordinates is @xmath256 , so the integration region is effectively @xmath257 but with @xmath253 replaced by @xmath258 . since @xmath259 , integrals in @xmath233 will never lead to saturation . cut diagrams are easier to compute than uncut feynman diagrams for three reasons . first and most trivial , a cut line contains a @xmath260 which makes the corresponding ` @xmath195 ' integration simpler to carry out . second and more importantly , the @xmath102-function demands the absence of the ` @xmath195 ' momentum across this line , so the cut line is cut also in the sense of being an open electric circuit . this generally reduces the number of possible flow diagrams and makes the corresponding integral easier to saturate . for example , each of the two - loop diagrams in fig . 13 has only one flow path . thirdly , the flow pattern often leads to vanishing cut diagrams . for example , both diagrams 13(c ) and 13(d ) are zero from the ` @xmath196 ' integration around the loop ( 12345 ) because the ` @xmath195 ' flows around that loop are all in the same direction . this accounts for the equality @xmath261 in eq . ( 6.1 ) . the cost of this simplicity is the presence of _ tricky diagrams _ , which are cut diagrams that are apparently logarithmic divergent at large @xmath202 . this happens whenever there is a loop with only one arrow present . arrows on the top fermion line should not be counted for this purpose because their approximate propagators @xmath262 no longer carry any @xmath202 . 13(a ) and 13(b ) are examples of such diagrams . this apparent divergence is produced by the approximation of replacing the inverse propagators of an upper line by @xmath263 , thus losing some @xmath215 factors needed for convergence . to regulate it we must replace the @xmath102-function of the cut line by a smeared @xmath102-function , thereby allowing a small amount of ` @xmath195 ' momentum to flow through , and in the process restoring the lost @xmath215 factor . if we do so to 13(a ) , the @xmath264 integration is no longer divergent , it will have exactly the same flow path as in 12(a ) and this is indicated in 13(a ) by the dotted arrows , so a pole can be taken at the bottom fermion line as shown . the result is given by ( b1 ) to be @xmath265 , the extra @xmath266 is there because the @xmath235 integration is bounded by the flow path in 12(a ) to be between 0 and 1 , so only half of the @xmath267 is integrated . when multiplied by the qed vertex and normalization factor @xmath268 , one obtains @xmath269 in ( 6.1 ) . there is another way to compute fig . this is to recognize the fact that the cut makes it symmetric in lines 1 and 2 , so we may replace the diagram by half the sum of it and its crossed diagram . using the sum rule ( 3.4 ) , @xmath132+a[21]=a[1|2]$ ] , a cut can be produced at the bottom line , and the resulting factor @xmath270 makes the @xmath271 integration convergent . see fig . moreover , the result of this ` @xmath196 ' integration is @xmath103 , exactly the same as if we were to do it by residue calculus . the extra factor of @xmath266 obtained in the last paragrpah now emerges because the double - cut diagram on the right of fig . 14 is the sum of two diagrams . now we come to the tricky diagram 13(b ) , which unlike the one - loop case is much more difficult to compute by regulating the @xmath102-functions . the reason is that there are now two cut lines , the relative magnitude of the small ` @xmath195 ' flows matters , and that produces once again two flow diagrams like 12(b ) and 12(c ) . the poles are no longer at the bottom fermion line and the computation is no simpler than the uncut diagrams . we must then compute it by the second method . with the double cuts in 13(b ) , it is symmetric in all the @xmath272 variables . insisting on this symmetry , 13(b ) is equal to @xmath273 times the sum of 6 diagrams , obtained by permuting the bottom gluon lines in all possible ways . from the factorization formula @xmath134 $ ] used on the bottom line , the result is equal to a diagram with all its fermion propagators cut . so 13(b ) is given by ( b1 ) to be @xmath274 . incorporating the extra qed factor @xmath275 for the @xmath23 matrix , we obtain the contribution of @xmath276 to @xmath277 shown in ( 6.1 ) . we conclude this appendix by discussing the remaining expressions in eqs . ( 6.1)(6.3 ) . we shall use the notation @xmath278 to denote the spacetime contribution to @xmath279 , etc . then @xmath280 , @xmath281 , @xmath282 , and @xmath283 can be obtained from ( 2.1 ) . the zero of @xmath284 in ( 6.1 ) is due to the vanishing of the color factor as shown in fig . next , we compute @xmath285 . the flow path of this is shown in fig . 13(f ) , with the dotted arrows indicating the small regulating current which is allowed to flow only in the direction shown . the calculation is identical to the uncut diagram @xcite , except that the factor @xmath286 is replaced by @xmath287 ( @xmath103 from the cut , @xmath40 because only one uncut line is left on top , and @xmath266 because only half of the @xmath102-function is integrated ) . the result can then be read off from ( 2.1 ) to be @xmath288 which gives rise to the expression in ( 6.3 ) . finally , we must show that @xmath289 and @xmath290 . the former can be seen from the flow path in fig . 13(g ) , where the arrows around the small triangle goes around in a closed loop . the latter is so because the scalar diagram in fig . 7 for @xmath291 is symmetrical in lines 2 and 3 but the triple gluon vertex is antisymmetrical in these two lines . nieh and y.p . yao , phys . 32 ( 1974 ) 1074 ; phys . d13 ( 1976 ) 1082 ; b. mccoy and t.t . wu , phys . 35 ( 1975 ) 604 ; phys . d12 ( 1975 ) 3257 ; d13 ( 1976 ) 1076 ; l. tyburski , _ ibid . _ 13 ( 1976 ) 1107 ; l.l . frankfurt and v.e . sherman , yad . 23 ( 1976 ) 1099 [ sov . j.  nucl .

"the interaction of electrically charged particles with an external magnetic field leads to a variety of phenomena in condensed matter physics . the classical examples are integer and fractional quantum hall effects which have been studied extensively both experimentally and theoretically in the last decades.@xcite in the domain of cold atoms the magnetic field can also change the behavior of the system , _ e.g. _ driving the bec - bcs transition by means of feshbach resonances.@xcite however , as cold atoms are neutral objects , the application of the magnetic field does not lead to an appearance of the lorentz force and hall effect . meanwhile , the possibility of generation of an artificial magnetic field in the atomic systems was proposed.@xcite this phenomenon is based on the effect of the geometric ( berry ) phase and requires illumination of the sample by several laser beams tuned in resonance with atomic transitions.@xcite this has opened the way for the observation of the analog of quantum hall effect for neutral cold bosons and fermions .    in solid state physics there exist electrically neutral bosonic particles similar to atoms . these are excitons bounded electron - hole pairs . the impact of excitons onto optical and transport properties of semiconductor materials have been studied intensively,@xcite and the possibility of bose - einstein condensation for excitons was consider theoretically long time ago.@xcite however , an experimental observation of exciton bec still remains an open question.@xcite a great step forward was achieved by using the effect of strong exciton - photon coupling in semiconductor microcavities.@xcite hybrid light - matter quasiparticles called exciton - polaritons revealed intriguing physical properties and the formation of a macroscopically coherent state of polaritons was experimentally reported.@xcite however , the question of how it is connected with the standard bec picture is still under debate.@xcite indeed , usually cavity polaritons have a very short lifetime ( not exceeding tens of picoseconds ) which prevents the possibility of full thermalization of the system . other candidates proposed for the achievement of bec in condensed matter systems are indirect excitons , composite quasiparticles consisting of electrons and holes located in spatially separated quantum wells and bound together by coulomb attraction ( see sketch in fig . [ fig1 ] ) . they obey bosonic statistics and can undergo bose - einstein condensation at temperatures around @xmath0.@xcite spatially indirect excitons differ from the usual 3d or 2d direct excitons by a much longer lifetime , robustness with respect to the effects of disorder and much stronger exciton - exciton interactions provided by dipole - dipole repulsion . consequently , much experimental efforts were devoted for observation of emergence of spontaneous coherence of the indirect exciton gas and macroscopically ordered exciton state.@xcite    properties of an exciton subjected to magnetic field were studied intensively@xcite and two qualitatively different behaviors of exciton were found . in the case of small magnetic field , where magnetic length is much bigger than exciton bohr radius , the center - of - mass motion of the exciton is not affected , while its internal structure is modified.@xcite in the opposite limit of strong magnetic fields an electron and a hole from lowest landau levels form _ magnetoexciton _ with properties different from the conventional exciton case.@xcite their internal structure and center of mass motion are coupled , and being exposed into crossed electric and magnetic field exhibit motion perpendicular to both directions due to collinearity of the drift velocities of the particles of opposite charge . @xcite    in this article we study the behavior of spatially indirect excitons in the _ weak _ magnetic field which is inhomogeneous in out - of - plane @xmath1 direction . while in this limit a homogeneous magnetic field only changes the binding energy of the exciton , the inhomogeneous magnetic field acts differently on electrons and holes and results in appearance of the lorentz force acting on the center - of - mass ( cm ) of a neutral exciton . consequently , an exciton acquires an effective `` charge '' and observation of an analog of the hall effect becomes possible . one should note that the following mechanism is qualitatively different from the case of magnetoexcitons described above . form spatially indirect excitons . the inhomogeneous in @xmath1 direction magnetic field @xmath2 affects the orbital motion of the center - of - mass ( cm ) of exciton . ] we start by considering the quantum problem of a single indirect exciton in a weak external magnetic field.@xcite the generic quantum hamiltonian of an electron and a hole in different quantum wells separated by distance @xmath3 with an external magnetic field pointed in @xmath1-direction perpendicular to the quantum well ( qw ) plane reads @xmath4 where @xmath5 are the radius - vectors of 2d electrons and holes , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are their effective masses and @xmath3 is the separation between qws . in the following consideration we restrict ourselves to the approximation of narrow qws . taking into account the finite width of the qw is straightforward but requires additional computational efforts.@xcite the external magnetic field acting on an electron and a hole is introduced into the hamiltonian via the vector potential @xmath8 . the magnetic field is considered to be inhomogeneous in @xmath1 direction and therefore the vector potentials for electrons and holes @xmath9 are different . the following hamiltonian for an electron - hole pair with attraction can be rewritten in terms of cm coordinates @xmath10 and relative motion coordinates @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 . thus , eq . ( [ h0 ] ) can be recast as @xmath14 where @xmath15 are vector differential operators for cm and relative exciton motion coordinates , respectively . we consider the case of a magnetic field @xmath2 that is inhomogeneous in @xmath1 direction . within the approximation of narrow qws this means that 2d electrons and holes in parallel layers feel different values of @xmath16 . in the following derivation we use the symmetric gauge for the vector potentials @xmath17/2 $ ] with values of the magnetic field taken different for the electrons and the holes , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , where the parameter @xmath20 describes the degree of the inhomogeneity of the magnetic field , @xmath21 . it is convenient to rewrite the hamiltonian ( [ h0 ] ) using the phase shift transformation of the wavefunction of the exciton similar to those used for the case of the homogeneous magnetic field @xcite @xmath22\cdot \mathbf{r}\big)\psi(\mathbf{r},\mathbf{r } ) . \label{psi}\ ] ] the new hamiltonian reads    @xmath23\cdot ( -i\nabla_{r})+\\ \notag & + \frac{e\hbar}{2\mu c}(\gamma - \alpha\xi_{2})[\mathbf{b}\times\mathbf{r}]\cdot ( -i\nabla_{r } ) + \underline{\alpha^{2}\frac{e^{2}b^{2}r^{2}}{8\mu c^{2 } } } - \underline{\alpha\frac{e\hbar}{mc}[\mathbf{b}\times \mathbf{r}]\cdot ( -i\nabla_{r})}-\\ \notag & -\alpha\frac{e\hbar}{2\mu c}[\mathbf{b}\times\mathbf{r}]\cdot ( -i\nabla_{r})-\alpha\frac{e^{2}}{4\mu c^2}(1-\alpha\gamma)[\mathbf{b}\times\mathbf{r}]\cdot[\mathbf{b}\times\mathbf{r}]-\frac{e^2}{\varepsilon\sqrt{r^2+l^2}},\end{aligned}\ ] ]    where @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 . note , that in the case of a homogeneous magnetic field , when @xmath28 , the phase transformation ( [ psi ] ) fully removes the action of the magnetic field on the cm of the exciton . however , in our case @xmath29 and one sees that the magnetic field affects the motion of the center - of - mass . moreover , strictly speaking it becomes impossible to separate relative and cm motions , and numerical treatment becomes necessary .    in eq . ( [ h3 ] ) the first two terms correspond to the kinetic energy of the cm and relative motion of an exciton . the third term is simply a modified diamagnetic shift , the fourth term is a quasielectric field term which pushes the electron and the hole in opposite directions and the fifth term is a modified zeeman - like term for the relative motion . all these terms exist for the homogeneous case ( @xmath28).@xcite    the new sixth , seventh , eighth and ninth terms ( where @xmath20 enters in the overall pre - factors ) describe the effect of the magnetic field on the cm motion of an exciton . finally , the tenth term represents the coulomb attraction between the electron and the hole and is responsible for creation of the bound exciton state . let us now examine the hamiltonian given by eq . ( [ h3 ] ) in more detail . the terms corresponding to the exciton in a uniform magnetic field have been analyzed before . in small fields the binding energy of the exciton increases , while strong magnetic fields on the contrary lead to a transition to the magnetoexciton regime.@xcite the crossover between these two regimes is well studied . in the present consideration we restrict ourself to the small magnetic field limit where cyclotron energy is much smaller than indirect exciton binding energy . as well , we do not consider the terms corresponding to the mixing of the center of mass and relative motion . the latter assumption can be justified by using the separate treatment of cm and relative motion of the exciton which corresponds born - oppenheimer approximation in atomic physics . indeed , considering the relative motion as fast and cm motion as slow , and averaging over fast motion , it is easy to see that those terms cancel as @xmath30\rangle=0 $ ] . here we focus on additional terms which appear due to the gradient of the magnetic field in the @xmath1 direction .    ) . ] the part of the hamiltonian corresponding to cm motion thus reads ( only underlined terms in eq . ( [ h3 ] ) are considered ) @xmath31 which can be simplified to @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the cm momentum of the electron - hole pair and @xmath34/2 $ ] . one can see that expression ( [ h6 ] ) looks exactly the same as the hamiltonian of a 2d particle with effective charge @xmath35 placed in a magnetic field perpendicular to the plain in the presence of an in - plane external parabolic confining potential @xmath36 . the value of the effective charge of the indirect exciton which describes its response to an inhomogeneous magnetic field is @xmath37 as one can expect , it is proportional to the difference of the magnetic field acting on the electron and hole subsystems and vanishes for the uniform case . note that this effective charge describes only the response to the magnetic field and an external electric field will still not affect the motion of an exciton which remains a neutral particle .     direction . ( b ) the profile of 2d density of indirect excitons in the inhomogeneous magnetic field . the drift velocity is taken @xmath38 cm / s , magnetic field difference @xmath39 mt and background concentration @xmath40 . the hall effect causes deviation of exciton density equal to @xmath41 . ] the solution of the eigenvalue problem for a particle in a magnetic field in the presence of parabolic confined potential is well known.@xcite this allows us to write the expression for the energy spectrum of an indirect exciton in an inhomogeneous magnetic field as    @xmath42    where @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are integer numbers . the quantum number @xmath46 corresponds to an angular momentum . the cyclotron frequency @xmath47 and the potential well quantization frequency @xmath48 read @xmath49 energy levels given by eq . ( [ ll ] ) are shown in fig . note , that differently from the case of the landau quantization for the free electrons , the spectrum is not equidistant . it should also be noted that the energy distance between the levels corresponding to the quantization of cm motion of an exciton is much smaller than the distance between excitonic levels appearing due to the quantization of relative motion . the spectrum in fig . [ fig2 ] thus can be interpreted as `` fine structure '' of @xmath50 exciton state in an inhomogeneous magnetic field .    for @xmath39 mt we can estimate @xmath51ev , which is much smaller than the thermal energy corresponding to @xmath0 . therefore , direct observation of quantization of the energy levels is hardly possible . one thus needs to propose another way of the observation of the effect of an inhomogeneous magnetic field on indirect excitons . note that the binding energy of the exciton in typical gaas / algaas structure with @xmath52 nm separation between centers of quantum wells is @xmath53 mev , which is much larger than @xmath54 . this confirms the validity of the born - oppenheimer approximation which we used . we propose an experiment where the lorentz force for neutral excitons can be detected analogously to the classical hall effect case ( see fig . [ fig3 ] ) . the key point is generation of a flow of excitons , which is a more complicated task than for the case of electrons since excitons are electrically neutral particles and application of an electric field does not lead to the appearance of the exciton current . however , this current can be created in a counter - flow experiment , where polarity of the drain - source voltage is different for the layers of the electrons and the holes . the counterflow techniques is a well developed method and was widely used by eisenstein and co - workers for the study of the physical properties of quantum hall bilayers.@xcite    the drift velocity of an indirect exciton in a counter - flow experiment will be governed by the value of the electric fields in electron and hole layers , @xmath55 , and mobilities of the electrons and the holes @xmath56 :    @xmath57    one should note that the velocity can not be too large since the magnetic field tends to unbind fast moving excitons.@xcite        due to non - zero effective charge of the indirect exciton the lorentz force acting on cm coordinates appears @xmath58 . it deviates the moving exciton in the direction perpendicular to the direction of the electric field @xmath59 . in the stationary regime this force should be compensated by the force provided by a gradient of potential energy of the exciton - exciton repulsion , which can be estimated as @xmath60 , with @xmath61,@xcite where @xmath3 is the distance between the qws with the electrons and holes and @xmath62 is a dielectric permittivity . putting @xmath63 one can determine the spatial profile of the exciton concentration in the hall bar geometry shown in fig . [ fig3 ] , where the flux of the excitons is directed along the @xmath64 axis , @xmath65 and @xmath66 denotes a background 2d density of the indirect excitons . the density profile is shown in fig . [ fig3 ] for the magnetic field @xmath67 , @xmath68 and drift velocity @xmath69 . the variation of the density can be measured by analyzing the spatial variation of the blueshift of the exciton photoluminescence in the near - field experiment . one should also note that for the described hall effect for exciton the relevant quantity is difference of magnetic fields @xmath70 and not an absolute value @xmath16 , which can be chosen arbitrarily small . previously we considered an abstract situation of inhomogeneous magnetic field . the realization of such situation in experiment is a non - trivial task . for an infinite sample the gauss s law for magnetism forbids the possibility of magnetic field generation with gradient in growth direction . however , the finiteness of studied structure allows one to consider a situation where magnetic field lines are non - uniform in @xmath71 plane , but characteristic magnetic length is much larger than size of the sample . thus , a magnitude of magnetic field is locally homogeneous and different for electron and hole layer . these can be realized in practice using several schemes.@xcite    first , the difference in the magnetic fields acting on electrons and holes @xmath70 can be achieved _ e.g. _ by using magnetic semiconductor material for one of the qws ( fig . [ fig4 ] ( a ) ) . in particular , the inhomogeneity can be realized by growing a ga@xmath72mn@xmath73as quantum well for electrons , where @xmath64 denotes a fraction of manganese magnetic impurities . experimentally , @xmath64 usually lies in the range from @xmath74 to @xmath75,@xcite but in state of art samples it can achieve @xmath76 fraction of manganese.@xcite the magnetic field induced by a single mn atom as a function of distance from it @xmath77 reads as @xmath78 where @xmath79 is a vacuum permeability , @xmath80 is a radius of the atom and @xmath81 denotes its magnetic moment . for mn atom it is equal to @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the bohr magneton.@xcite    using eq . ( [ mnb ] ) we can estimate that an electron moving through the structure with @xmath84 will experience a magnetic field of magnitude @xmath85 mt . the magnetic field in the hole qw , which is separated from electron qw by distance @xmath52 nm , is however three orders of magnitude smaller , and total magnetic field difference is @xmath86 mt . if we take @xmath64 to be @xmath76 the magnetic field can exceed @xmath87 mt . therefore the values of @xmath70 used for calculation of hall effect in the article can be in principal realized in experiments . second , an inhomogeneous field can be generated using the meissner effect . in the vicinity of superconducting film ( sc ) the magnetic field lines are strongly non - uniform and this can be used for local generation of magnetic field gradient in growth direction ( see sketch in fig . [ fig4 ] ( b ) ) . finally , another possible way of non - uniform magnetic field generation relies on the quadrupole magnet field . in the volume between four magnets magnetic field lines are strongly non - uniform and magnetic field magnitude changes rapidly in the plane of the system . in conclusion , we proposed a method of generation of the effective magnetic field acting on a system of electrically neutral spatially indirect excitons . it appears in the case of applied weak magnetic field which is inhomogeneous in @xmath1 direction . we analyzed the energy spectrum of the system and predicted the existence of an analog of the classical hall effect for spatially indirect excitons . it can be detected in a counter - flow experiment where asymmetric photoluminescence profile of indirect excitons is expected . j. kasprzak , m. richard , s. kundermann , a. baas , p. jeambrun , j. m. j. keeling , f. m. marchetti , m. h. szymanska , r. andre , j. l. staehli , v. savona , p. b. littlewood , b. deveaud , and le si dang , nature * 443 * , 409 ( 2006 ) .","**Summary of the Article:**

The article discusses the interaction of electrically charged particles with an external magnetic field, specifically focusing on the behavior of spatially indirect excitons in a weak magnetic field. The authors review the classical and quantum effects of magnetic fields on excitons, including the Lorentz force, magnetic field-induced binding energy, and the quantization of energy levels.

**Key Points:**

1. **Classical Effects:** The authors discuss the classical effects of magnetic fields on excitons","we study the effect of an inhomogeneous out - of - plane magnetic field on the behaviour of 2d spatially indirect excitons . due to the difference of the magnetic field acting on electrons and holes the total lorentz force affecting the center of mass motion of an 
 indirect exciton appears . 
 consequently , an indirect exciton acquires an effective charge proportional to the gradient of the magnetic field . 
 the appearance of the lorentz force causes the hall effect for neutral bosons which can be detected by measurement of the spatially inhomogeneous blueshift of the photoluminescence using counterflow experiment .",18771,537,626,17.21 seconds,2.42 MB,0.36470588235294116,0.11904761904761905,0.29411764705882354,0.8364303708076477,medium
"understanding the wetting behavior of liquids on solid substrates @xcite is a prerequisite for making use of a myriad of biological and technological applications such as eye irrigation , cell adhesion , tertiary oil recovery , coating , lubrication , paper industry , micro - mechanical devices , and the production of integrated circuits . generically , the solid surfaces in the above mentioned examples are not ideal in the sense that they are neither smooth nor homogeneous . most surfaces are topographically or chemically heterogeneous . such heterogeneities may substantially change the wetting behavior of these surfaces @xcite , which is not necessarily detrimental with respect to envisaged applications . certain topographically structured surfaces are superhydrophobic or superhydrophilic . in the first case droplets roll off these substrates ( instead of flowing ) , such that these surfaces are self - cleaning @xcite . in the second case the surface topography leads to a complete spreading of droplets @xcite . tailored topographic surface structures can induce particular dewetting processes which in turn can be exploited to pattern substrates on the micron scale @xcite . microfluidics is another strong driving force for the research on the dynamics of fluids on structured substrates . shrinking standard laboratory setups to a lab - on - a - chip promises huge cost reduction and speed - up @xcite . open microfluidic systems , i.e. , with free liquid - vapor or liquid - liquid interfaces , may provide various advantages such as reduced friction , better accessibility of the reactants , and reduced risk of clogging by solute particles @xcite . in open microfluidic devices fluids are guided along chemical channels @xcite or in grooves @xcite , which can be chemically patterned in oder to provide additional functionality @xcite . wetting phenomena on topographically structured substrates have attracted substantial research efforts @xcite with , however , the main focus on equilibrium phenomena . in view of the aforementioned applications , dynamical aspects are of particular interest . in spite of this demand , theoretical work on the dynamics of liquid films and droplets on topographically structured substrates has started only recently . in most of these studies the dynamics of the fluids is assumed to be well described by macroscopic hydrodynamic equations , which are solved either directly @xcite , by a lattice boltzmann method @xcite , or in the thin film ( lubrication ) regime @xcite . the applicability of this latter method is limited because the inherent long - wavelength approximation does not keep track of many relevant microscopic features @xcite .    on the nanoscale , macroscopic hydrodynamic equations turn out to be inadequate for describing the dynamics of fluids . overcoming this deficit is the focus of a new research area called nanofluidics @xcite . wetting phenomena in particular reveal these deviations ; for a recent review of these issues see ref . however , hydrodynamic equations can be augmented to include hydrodynamic slip , the finite range of intermolecular interactions , and thermal fluctuations . the resulting mesoscopic hydrodynamic equations have been rather successful in analyzing , e.g. , the dynamics of dewetting on homogeneous substrates @xcite . the presence of intermolecular interactions can be summarized into the so - called disjoining pressure ( djp ) , @xmath0 where the effective interface potential @xmath1 is the cost of free energy to maintain a homogeneous wetting film of prescribed thickness @xmath2 . on a homogeneous substrate @xmath1 is independent of lateral coordinates parallel to the substrate surface and the equilibrium wetting film thickness @xmath3 minimizes @xmath4 . however , on chemically or topographically inhomogeneous substrates ( structured , rough , or dirty ) the generalized disjoining pressure does depend in addition on these lateral coordinates . in most studies , the lateral variations of the disjoining pressure have been modelled rather crudely , i.e. , the substrate is assumed to be locally homogeneous and lateral interferences of heterogeneities are neglected : e.g. , a step is typically modelled by an abrupt change of the disjoining pressure @xcite . recently we have demonstrated , that the actually smooth variation of the lateral action of surface heterogeneities can change the behavior of droplets in the vicinity of chemical steps @xcite or topographical features ( edges and wedges ) @xcite even qualitatively . in the present study we extend these results to the case of an isolated straight topographic step in an otherwise homogeneous substrate ( as shown in fig . [ dpstep ] ) and we recover the previously studied case of isolated wedges and edges in the limit of infinite step height @xmath5 . we should emphasize that our investigation provides only a first but nonetheless essential step towards understanding the dynamics of droplets on arbitrarily structured substrates . although more refined than previously used models the present one is still rather simple . we only consider additive lennard - jones type intermolecular interactions , i.e. , we do not take into account electrostatic interactions which would be very important for polar fluids . we assume the fluid to be newtonian , non - volatile , and incompressible ( which is compatible with the frequently used so - called sharp - kink approximation of classical equilibrium density functional theory ( see , e.g. , ref . we also assume a no - slip boundary condition at the solid surface @xcite and neglect the influence of thermal fluctuations @xcite . for numerical reasons we restrict our investigation to two - dimensional ( 2d ) droplets , corresponding to three - dimensional ( 3d ) liquid ridges ( or rivulets ) which are translationally invariant in the direction parallel to the step ; nonetheless we expect our results to hold qualitatively also for 3d droplets . ( on the top side and bottom side of the step ) are exposed to the vertically and laterally varying disjoining pressure @xmath6 , the contour plot of which is shown . the topographic step and the drops are taken to be translationally invariant along the @xmath7 axis ( i.e. , orthogonal to the image plane ) . in ( a ) the substrate is chosen to correspond to the minus case with ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) and in ( b ) the substrate corresponds to the plus case ( @xmath10 , @xmath9 ) ( see eq . ( [ djpfar ] ) for definitions ) . lengths ( @xmath11 , @xmath2 , @xmath5 ) and the disjoining pressure @xmath6 are measured in units of @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively ( see the main text for definitions ) . ] we study the dynamics of non - volatile and newtonian nanodroplets ( corresponding to three - dimensional ridges which are translationally invariant in one lateral direction ) on topographically stepped surfaces within the framework of mesoscopic hydrodynamics , i.e. , by solving the augmented stokes equation presented in sec .  [ mesohydrosec ] with the numerical method described in [ numersec ] . we consider in particular the effects due to the long range of lennard - jones type intermolecular interactions which enter the theoretical description in terms of the disjoining pressure ( djp ) as illustrated in fig . [ dpstep ] . we assume the substrate to be chemically homogeneous in the lateral directions and the surface to be covered by a thin layer of a different material . as detailded in sec . [ modeling ] this leads to two adjustable parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 which enter into the djp and characterize the wetting properties of the substrate , i.e. , the equilibrium contact angle @xmath16 and the wetting film thickness @xmath3 ( see fig .  [ djpshapes ] ) . as shown in fig . [ bc ] both for positive and for negative hamaker constants one can find a one - parameter family of pairs @xmath17 leading to the same @xmath16 on a flat substrate ( i.e. , without a step ) . as shown in fig . [ flat ] nanodroplets on substrates with the same @xmath16 but with different values of @xmath14 and @xmath15 assume shapes which differ mainly in the vicinity of the three - phase contact line with the apex region is almost unaffected by the substrate potential . the results of the numerical solution of the mesoscopic hydrodynamic equations are presented in sec . [ results ] . in contrast to macroscopic expectations based on a capillary model ( i.e. , taking into account only interface energies and neglecting the long range of the intermolecular interactions ) , topographic steps do influence droplets in their vicinity : on substrates with a positive hamaker constant ( figs .  [ effstepplus ] and [ wedgediffhplus ] ) , droplets move in uphill direction while on substrates with a negative hamaker constant ( figs . [ effstepp ] and [ wedgediffhminus ] ) the droplets move in the opposite direction . as expected the forces on the droplets and their resulting velocity increase with the step height , but also with the absolute value of the hamaker constant . this is the case if the contact angle is varied ( see , e.g. , figs .  [ edgeeffc ] and [ wedgediffcminus ] ) and even if the contact angle is fixed by varying the hamaker constant and the properties of the coating layer together ( see figs .  [ edgediffb ] , [ edgeplus ] , [ wedgediffb ] , and [ wedgediffbplus ] ) .    the speed of the droplets increases with their size as demonstrated in fig . [ wedgedropsize ] . as detailed in subsec . [ direction ] , the influence of the step on a droplet can be phrased in terms of an effective wettability gradient , i.e. , a spatially varying equilibrium contact angle . the driving force on droplets on such substrates increases linearly with the droplet size because the difference in equilibrium contact angle at the two contact lines of the liquid ridges increases roughly linearly with the distance from the steps . the velocity of droplets driven away from the step decreases rapidly with the distance from the step as shown in sec .  [ discuss ] . but droplets moving towards the step ( either on the top side or on the bottom side of the step ) stop with their leading contact line close to the step edge or wedge , respectively . therefore they do not cross the step ( see figs . [ effstepp ] , [ comppisigma ] , [ edgeeffc ] , [ edgediffb ] , [ wedgediffhplus ] , and [ wedgediffbplus ] ) . accordingly , edges , wedges , and steps act as barriers for migrating droplets ( which is also true macroscopically ) because droplets sitting right at the tip of an edge are in an free - energetically unfavorable state ( see fig .  [ overedge ] ) while droplets located in the corner of a wedge are in a state corresponding to a local minimum of the free energy ( see fig . [ wedgeforce ] ) . therefore , an external force is required to push droplets over edges ( see fig . [ edgeforce ] ) or to pull them out of wedges ( see fig . [ wedgeforce ] ) . in both cases , the total ( i.e. , integrated over the droplet volume ) force required to accomplish this increases slightly with the droplet volume , but less than linearly . this means , that if the force is applied via a body force density acting per unit volume ( e.g. , gravity ) larger droplets experience a larger force and therefore overcome steps more easily . in addition , the lateral action of intermolecular forces can also pin droplets at edges and near wedges . however , droplets which initially span a topographic step always end up filling the wedge at the step base , either with the upper contact line pinned at the step edge or , if the droplet volume is too small , with the upper contact line on the vertical part of the step , as shown in fig . [ overwedge ] . a deeper understanding of the dynamics of droplets in the vicinity of edges and wedges can be reached by analyzing the forces acting on the droplet surface , i.e. , the disjoining pressure and surface tension ( see eqs . ( [ dpforce ] ) and ( [ sigmaforce ] ) , respectively ) . as demonstrated in fig . [ comppisigma ] , if the droplets move under the influence of the topographic step only , the main contribution to the driving force stems from the disjoining pressure . as shown in figs . [ dropsize ] and [ stepsize ] , the numerically observed features of the dynamics of droplets can be understood in terms of the disjoining pressure induced force density on the droplets calculated for droplets of simple parabolic shapes used as initial conditions for the numerical solution of the hydrodynamic equations . as shown in fig . [ profsize ] the actual relaxed droplet shape is different but the calculated forces depend only weakly on the deviation of the actual shape from its parabolic approximation . in the limit of large distances from the step the force can be calculated analytically ( see subsec .  [ direction ] ) : far from the step the total force per unit ridge length @xmath18 ( with the cross - sectional area @xmath19 ) essentially depends on the ratio of the step height @xmath5 and the distance from the step @xmath20 as well as on the ratio of the apex height @xmath21 and @xmath20 . the corresponding asymptotic results are summarized in fig . [ asymptofig ] . in all cases the force density varies according to a power law @xmath22 with @xmath23 . for finite sized droplet and steps of finite height we obtain the fastest decay and for almost macroscopic droplets in the vicinity of finite sized steps as well as for nanodroplets near isolated edges and wedges we get @xmath24 . while our present analysis can not be applied to the case of an almost macroscopic droplet in a wedge , for large drops ( @xmath25 ) next to an isolated edge we get the weakest decay with @xmath26 . in any case , the total force per unit length @xmath27 is proportional to the hamaker constant as observed in the numerical solution of the mesoscopic stokes dynamics as well as in the force analysis presented in subec . [ force ] . the dynamics of large drops ( @xmath25 ) is equivalent to the dynamics of macroscopic drops on a surface with an effective chemical wettability gradient ( i.e. , a spatially varying `` equilibrium contact angle '' @xmath28 ) @xcite . at low reynolds numbers the mean field dynamics of an incompressible newtonian fluid of viscosity @xmath29 is given by the navier - stokes equation for the local pressure @xmath30 and the flow field @xmath31 : @xmath32 with the stress tensor @xmath33 . in this study , we neglect the influence of the vapor phase or air above the film . therefore the tangential components of the component of the stress tensor @xmath34 normal to the liquid - vapor surface @xmath35 ( with outward pointing normal vector @xmath36 ) is zero . the normal component of @xmath34 , i.e. , the normal forces acting on the liquid surface , are given by the sum of the laplace pressure and of the disjoining pressure : @xmath37 with the surface tension coefficient @xmath38 and the local mean curvature @xmath39 of the liquid surface ; @xmath40 is the strength of a spatially constant external body force density pointing in the @xmath11-direction ( with @xmath41 as the corresponding potential ) which we introduce in order to study the strength of barriers to the lateral motion of droplets . alternatively , for incompressible fluids one can define a new pressure @xmath42 such that the external body force density @xmath40 enters into the stokes equation eq . ( [ eq : stokes ] ) rather than the boundary condition in eq . ( [ eq : surfacebc ] ) : @xmath43 . although this approach might be more intuitive , the equivalent form used here is more convenient for implementing the boundary element method used here to numerically solve these equations ( see [ numersec ] ) . the dynamics of the free liquid surface is determined by mass conservation together with the incompressibility condition : the local normal velocity is identical to the normal component of the local flow field . we neglect hydrodynamic slip at the liquid - substrate surface @xmath44 and we only consider impermeable substrates . since we assume the substrate to be stationary this results in the following boundary condition for the flow field : @xmath45    in order to avoid strong initial shape relaxation of the droplets ( in response to placing them on the substrate with a certain shape ) which can lead to significant lateral displacements @xcite , we choose a parabolic initial profile which is smoothly connected to a precursor film of thickness @xmath3 : @xmath46^{|x-\bar{x}|^m+1},\ ] ] such that @xmath47 is the droplet height at the center and half the base width . accordingly the distance of the droplet edge from the step at @xmath48 is given by @xmath49 with @xmath20 the position of the center of the droplet in the @xmath11-direction . the parameter @xmath50 specifies the smoothness of the transition region from the drop to the wetting layer . in this study we choose @xmath50 to be @xmath51 . we investigate the droplet dynamics for two different situations . in the first one we position the droplet on the top side of the step of height @xmath5 with the three - phase contact line @xmath52 at a distance @xmath53 with @xmath54 from the step edge at @xmath48 . in the second situation we place the droplet on the bottom side of the step with the three - phase contact line @xmath55 at a distance @xmath56 with @xmath57 from the wedge at the base of the step .    in equilibrium ( [ eq : surfacebc ] ) reduces to the euler - lagrange equation of the effective interface hamiltonian of a fluid film on a substrate as derived , e.g. , in ref . this means that we approximate the normal forces on the liquid surface due to the intermolecular interactions by the disjoining pressure derived for equilibrium systems .    in a non - equilibrium situation , the unbalanced forces acting on the fluid surface add up to a resulting net force on the liquid body . we separately consider the two contributions @xmath58 and @xmath59 from the disjoining pressure and from the laplace pressure , respectively , both normalized by the droplet volume @xmath60 and given by the following integrals over the liquid - vapor surface @xmath61 of the droplets : @xmath62 for a liquid ridge translationally invariant in @xmath7-direction both integrals as well as @xmath63 are proportional to the macroscopic ridge length @xmath64 , so that the latter drops out of the expressions for the force densities ( in units of @xmath65 ) @xmath58 and @xmath59 . in three dimensions @xmath66 is a two - dimensional surface area element . @xmath19 is the two - dimensional cross - sectional area of the liquid ridge . in the following we calculate the disjoining pressure for a fluid film or droplet near a topographic step as displayed in fig . [ dpstep ] . apart from a very thin coating layer of thickness @xmath67 we assume the substrate material to be homogeneous , disregarding its discrete molecular structure . many substrates used in experiments are coated , e.g. , by a native oxide layer or by a polymer brush which is used to modify the wetting properties of the substrate . however , a more refined analysis of the djp , which takes the molecular structure of the substrate and of the fluid into account , yields terms of a form similar to those generated by a coating layer @xcite . in general , i.e. , far from the critical point of the fluid , the vapor or gas phase covering the system has a negligible density which we neglect completely . assuming pairwise additivity of the intermolecular interactions , i.e. , the fluid particles as well as the fluid and the substrate particles are taken to interact with each other via pair potentials @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 relate to liquid ( @xmath71 ) , substrate ( @xmath72 ) , or coating ( @xmath73 ) particles and @xmath74 is the interatomic distance , one can show that the disjoining pressure ( djp ) of the system is given by @xcite @xmath75}\ , \,d^3r,\ ] ] with @xmath76 and @xmath77 and @xmath78 as the number densities of the liquid and substrate , respectively . @xmath79 is the actual substrate volume .    in order to facilitate the calculation of the disjoining pressure of the step we decompose it into contributions from quarter spaces ( edges ) forming building blocks which can be calculated analytically . we first consider an @xmath80dge occupying the lower left quarter space @xmath81 , which in the following we denote by @xmath82 . for lennard - jones type pair potentials @xmath83 , where @xmath84 and @xmath85 are material parameters , the djp in the vicinity of a non - coated edge occupying @xmath86 is given by @xmath87 where @xmath88 and @xmath89 . the first term dominates close to the surface of the edge and the second term at large distances from the substrate . all integrals in eq . ( [ eqpie ] ) can be calculated analytically and one obtains the djp as the corresponding difference @xmath90 of two contributions with @xmath91\nonumber\\\end{aligned}\ ] ] and @xmath92\cdot\end{aligned}\ ] ]    the contributions to the disjoining pressure of a thin @xmath73oating layer of thickness @xmath67 on the @xmath93pper side of the edge occupying @xmath94 , the @xmath74ight part of the edge occupying @xmath95 , and the thin rod which fills the @xmath96ip area of the edge @xmath97 can be calculated analogously : @xmath98 with @xmath99 and @xmath100 ; @xmath101 stands for @xmath93 ( @xmath93pper ) , @xmath74 ( @xmath74ight ) , or @xmath96 ( @xmath96ip ) . actual coating layers have a more complicated structure , in particular in the direct vicinity of edges and wedges , which depends on the specific combination of coating and substrate material as well as on the way the coating is produced . such details can influence droplets if their contact line is right at the edge or wedge but the effect is proportional to the square of the coating layer thickness @xmath67 . for simplicity we only consider systems with coating layers which are thin compared to the wetting film thickness ( see below ) , for which the contribution from the thin rod of coating material at the tip of the edge or in the corner of the wedge is irrelevant . according to eq . ( [ picoat ] ) the contribution to the disjoining pressure from the upper coating layer can be decomposed into @xmath102 . to first order in @xmath67 we obtain @xmath103\end{aligned}\ ] ] and @xmath104.\end{aligned}\ ] ] by symmetry one has @xmath105 for the contribution of the vertical part of the coating . the djp of a coated edge occupying @xmath106 is therefore given by @xmath107    the djp contribution from a coated edge occupying the right quarter space @xmath108 can be obtained analogously . however , since the integrals for the right part corresponding to eqs . ( [ eqpie ] ) and ( [ picoat ] ) are the mirror image ( with respect to the @xmath109-plane ) of their counterparts for the left hand side , the former ones can be expressed in terms of the latter ones . therefore the djp of the coated lower right quarter space @xmath110 is equal to @xmath111 . combining the contributions of the left and the right part leads to the following expression for the djp of a step of height @xmath5 : @xmath112 the last term on the right hand side of eq . ( [ dpstepeq ] ) removes the artificial extra coatings on the left and the right quarter spaces ( at @xmath48 , @xmath113 ) which get buried upon building the step out of the coated edges . figure  [ dpstep ] shows typical examples for the djp . the djp is not only a function of the vertical distance from the substrate , but also of the lateral distance from the step . in this regard , the substrate in the vicinity of the step resembles a chemically structured substrate with laterally varying wettability @xcite . for positions far from the step the distribution of the djp resembles that of the @xmath73oated , laterally @xmath5omogeneous flat substrate obtained by setting @xmath114 in eq . ( [ dpstepeq ] ) . to linear order in @xmath67 one has @xmath115 since the repulsive contributions decay rapidly with distance from the substrate we neglect all those repulsive contributions which are shorter ranged than the corresponding term ( @xmath116 ) arising from @xmath117 @xcite , leading to @xmath118 with @xmath119 . the equilibrium thicknesses @xmath3 of the wetting film on such a substrate minimizes the effective interface potential @xcite @xmath120 with eq . ( [ piflat ] ) this leads to @xmath121 the second term is usually written as @xmath122 , where @xmath123 is the so - called hamaker constant .    at this point we introduce dimensionless quantities ( marked by @xmath124 ) such that lengths are measured in units of @xmath125}^{1/6}$ ] which for @xmath126 and @xmath127 is the equilibrium wetting film thickness @xmath3 on the uncoated flat substrate . the djp is measured in units of the ratio @xmath13 where @xmath38 is the liquid - vapor surface tension . thus the dimensionless djp @xmath128 far from the edge has the form @xmath129 in the first and second term of eq . ( [ djpfarstar ] ) the upper ( lower ) sign corresponds to @xmath130 @xmath131 and @xmath132 @xmath133 , respectively . the dimensionless amplitude @xmath134 , with @xmath135 , compares the strength of the effective intermolecular forces in the uncoated case and of the surface tension forces . the amplitude @xmath136 measures the strength of the coating layer . since the molecular structure of the substrate and of the fluid yields a term of the same form @xcite we consider @xmath14 itself as a parameter independent of the actual properties of the coating layer . for the interactions considered here , @xmath137 is a necessary condition for the occurrence of an equilibrium wetting layer of nonzero thickness but @xmath138 can be positive or negative . therefore the first term in eq . ( [ djpfarstar ] ) can only be positive while the second term can be positive or negative . in the following we shall refer to these two cases simply as the minus ( ) and the plus ( ) case . in order to avoid a clumsy notation in the following we also drop the stars . with this , one has @xmath139    figure  [ djpshapes ] shows the typical profile of @xmath140 for the minus and the plus case and also the corresponding equilibrium wetting layer thickness @xmath3 for which @xmath141 . while the parameter @xmath15 measures the strength of the djp , by changing @xmath14 one can modify the shape of the djp @xcite . in eq . ( [ djpfar ] ) the admissible value ranges of @xmath15 and @xmath14 which provide partial wetting can be inferred from considering the equilibrium contact angle @xmath142 @xcite : @xmath143 the admissible value ranges of @xmath14 and @xmath15 for which @xmath144 ( partial or incomplete wetting ) are given in fig . [ bc ] for both the minus and the plus case . in the minus case , for each value of @xmath14 one can find a value of @xmath15 such that the resulting substrate is partially wet . since the signs of the first two terms in eq . ( [ djpfar ] ) differ the disjoining pressure has a zero for any @xmath14 and the depth of the minimum of the corresponding effective interface potential can be tuned by choosing an appropriate value for @xmath15 . in the plus case , however , @xmath14 has to be negative in order to obtain a sign change of @xmath6 . the maximum admissible value of @xmath14 ( i.e. , @xmath145 ) can be obtained by simultaneously solving the following equations for @xmath3 and @xmath146 : @xmath147 @xmath148 from which one finds @xmath149 ( compare fig . [ djpshapes](d ) ) .    in order to obtain dimensionless hydrodynamic equations ( see eqs . ( [ eq : stokes])([eq : surfacebc ] ) ) we choose @xmath150 as the velocity scale . with this , the dimensionless form of the stess tensor is given by @xmath151 and the surface tension coefficient drops out of eq . ( [ eq : surfacebc ] ) . the dimensionless time is given in units of @xmath152 . in order to study the dynamics of nanodroplets we solve the dimensionless hydrodynamic equations with a standard biharmonic boundary integral method described in more detail in [ numersec ] .    ) djp ( in units of @xmath15 ) of a flat homogenous substrate for ( a ) the minus and ( b ) the plus case ( see eq . ( [ djpfar ] ) ) . the corresponding zeros @xmath3 of the djp for different values of @xmath14 are given in ( c ) and ( d ) for the minus and the plus case , respectively . in ( c ) and ( d ) full lines indicate stable wetting films and dashed lines unstable films . ]     and @xmath15 for which the system exhibits a partial wetting ( pw ) situation , i.e. , @xmath153 for the minus ( a ) and the plus ( b ) case . ] on a flat homogeneous substrate for various values of @xmath14 and @xmath15 for the minus and the plus case . ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) for the minus case are i ( -1 , 7.7583 ) with @xmath154 , ii ( 0 , 2.6667 ) with @xmath155 , and iii ( 1 , 1.2703 ) with @xmath156 , and for the plus case i ( -2.5 , 4.2327 ) with @xmath157 and ii ( -4 , 0.9265 ) with @xmath158 . the values of @xmath14 and @xmath15 are chosen such that in all cases @xmath159 . ]    in order to provide the information and terminology required for the subsequent considerations we first recall some basic results for the wetting of flat and homogeneous substrates . for this purpose a nanodroplet with @xmath160 and an initial configuration given by eq . ( [ inicond ] ) was positioned on the substrate . figure  [ flat ] shows the equilibrium profile of the nanodroplet for various values of @xmath15 and @xmath14 resulting in an equilibrium contact angle @xmath159 for both the minus and the plus case , i.e. , the values @xmath17 lie on the dashed curves in figs . [ bc](a ) and [ bc](b ) . it is evident from the figure that the droplets have relaxed from the initial condition . the equilibrium profiles in all cases are roughly equal but the nanodroplets differ near their contact lines ( see the inset of fig . [ flat ] ) and with respect to their heights . the term proportional to @xmath14 in eq . ( [ djpfar ] ) is rather short - ranged and most important in the direct vicinity of the substrate . the top parts of the droplets are only influenced by the term @xmath161 such that the curvature at the peak changes with @xmath15 , independently of @xmath14 . this also changes the droplet height . however , also the wetting film thickness @xmath3 changes with @xmath14 , such that the differences in droplet height in fig . [ flat ] are a combined result of both effects .    due to the translational symmetry of the substrate and due to the symmetry of the initial drop configuration the shape relaxation does not result in a lateral displacement of the droplets , in contrast droplets placed on heterogeneous substrates @xcite . previous studies of droplets near edges ( corresponding to steps of infinite height ) have shown that , in contrast to what is expected from a simple macroscopic model taking into account only interface energies , droplets are attracted towards the edge in the minus case and repelled from the edge in the plus case @xcite . in the minus case , the droplets move towards the edge with increasing velocity , but they stop rather abruptly before the leading contact line reaches the edge . the distance from the edge at which the droplets stop increases with decreasing @xmath14 , i.e. , with increasing strength of the coating layer . in the plus case , the droplets move away from the step with a velocity which decreases with the distance from the step . the strength of the attraction or repulsion is expected to be lower for steps of finite height .       and @xmath162 , respectively . the droplets are initially positioned at a distance @xmath163 from the step . the droplets have an initial radius @xmath160 . @xmath164 and @xmath8 correspond to @xmath159 . the vertical scale is equal to the lateral scale . the corresponding lateral ( b ) and vertical ( c ) position of the center of mass ( @xmath20 , @xmath165 ) of the droplet relative to the step edge as a function of time . ]    . initially it is positioned at @xmath163 ( @xmath166 , dash - dotted line ) . for the minus case it moves towards an isolated edge where it stops with the leading contact line pinned at the step edge ( full line ) . for this final configuration the arclength @xmath72 of the interface is measured as indicated from a certain position on the wetting layer on the vertical side of the step . ( b ) a comparison between djp induced ( eq .  ( [ dpforce ] ) , full line ) and surface tension induced ( eq .

[ effstepp](a ) for @xmath164 and @xmath8 which corresponds to @xmath159 . in order to have a better view on the dynamics we monitor the time evolution of the position of the center of mass of the droplets ( @xmath20 , @xmath165 ) relative to the step edge in figs . [ effstepp](b ) and [ effstepp](c ) , where @xmath20 and @xmath165 are given by @xmath187 with @xmath60 denoting the droplet volume . since the droplets are smoothly connected to the wetting film , which on large substrates would influence the center of mass of the fluid , in calculating @xmath20 and @xmath165 we only consider the fluid above @xmath188 with @xmath189 , i.e. , only the fluid volume slightly above the wetting film . we selected @xmath190 ; but since we focus on substrates with equilibrium contact angles of about @xmath191 the results are only weakly affected by the precise choice of the value of @xmath192 .    in all cases the dynamics of the droplets proceeds in three stages . the first stage is a fast initial shape relaxation , similar to the behavior on homogeneous substrates , which is accompanied by a lowering of the droplet center of mass @xmath165 without any considerable lateral motion . this is followed by a relatively slow lateral motion towards the edge , during which the changes in the droplet shape are almost unnoticeable . although the droplet shape is slightly asymmetric the lateral surface tension induced force density @xmath59 defined in eq . ( [ sigmaforce ] ) is much smaller than the force density @xmath58 induced by the djp ( see eq . ( [ dpforce ] ) ) as shown in figs . [ comppisigma](b ) . figure  [ effstepp](b ) clearly shows that the lateral motion of the droplet slows down rapidly as soon as its leading three phase contact line reaches the edge . during this third and final stage a part of the droplet volume leaks into the wetting film on the vertical part of the step and as a result the droplet experiences a sudden drop in its height @xmath165 ( see fig . [ effstepp](c ) ) . the trailing three - phase contact line of the droplet still continues its motion towards the step and as a consequence the mean height of the droplet increases again and becomes even larger than during the migration stage . while the droplet contracts , its asymmetry gradually increases such that the surface tension induced force density @xmath59 grows and finally , as the equilibrium configuration is reached , cancels @xmath58 . ( this latter stage of cancelation is not visualized in fig .  [ comppisigma](b ) due to numerical problems in evaluating the force densities on droplets once they have reached the step edge . ) in equilibrium , at each point on its surface the laplace pressure and the disjoining pressure ad up to the constant value of the hydrostatic pressure in the droplet ( see fig .  [ comppisigma](c ) ) .    increasing the step height from @xmath193 to 5 and 10 results in a significant increase in the droplet speed during the migration phase . the asymptotic speed for isolated edges ( corresponding to @xmath194 ) , i.e. , the maximum speed , is almost reached for @xmath195 . this height value is large compared to the thickness of the wetting layer but comparable with the droplet size ; here the base diameter is @xmath196 . however , in order to be able to conclude that the step height above which the droplet perceives the step as an isolated edge is comparable with the droplet size further calculations for droplets of different size are needed .    changing the equilibrium contact angle @xmath16 by increasing @xmath15 while keeping @xmath8 does not qualitatively change the behavior of the droplets , as shown in fig . [ edgeeffc](a ) for droplets with @xmath160 near an isolated edge ( corresponding to @xmath194 ) , apart from the increase of @xmath165 during the initial relaxation process for large @xmath16 . the reason for this increase in droplet height is , that the initial shape of the droplet is not adapted to the substrate parameters . changing @xmath15 does not change the functional form of the djp , only its strength . consequently , droplets move faster for larger @xmath15 ( resulting in larger @xmath16 ) and their final shape is less symmetric . with the leading contact line pinned right at the step edge , large @xmath197 also result in an overhang over the step edge . since for fixed wetting film thickness @xmath12 on the uncoated flat substrate the time scale used to obtain dimensionless hydrodynamic equations depends on the substrate parameters in the same manner as the dimensionless parameter @xmath15 , we rescale time by @xmath15 in figs . [ edgeeffc](b ) and [ edgeeffc](c ) , as well as in all subsequent figures which compare @xmath198 and @xmath199 for different values of @xmath15 . this corresponds to changing the substrate material but keeping surface tension , viscosity , and wetting film thickness constant @xcite . figure [ edgediffb](a ) shows the effect of changing the value of @xmath14 ( while keeping the contact angle constant ) on the dynamics and on the final configuration of droplets which start with @xmath160 and for the minus case on the top side of an isolated edge ( @xmath194 ) . for each value of @xmath14 we choose @xmath15 such that @xmath159 , i.e. , corresponding to the dashed curve in fig . [ bc](a ) . for all values of @xmath14 the droplets move towards the edge . changing the values of @xmath14 and @xmath15 does not qualitatively change the behavior of the system . however , a closer examination of @xmath20 and @xmath165 ( see figs .  [ edgediffb](b ) and [ edgediffb](c ) , respectively ) reveals quantitative differences in the dynamics and in the final configuration of the droplets despite the fact that the contact angle is the same for all these cases . for larger ( positive ) values of @xmath14 ( and thus @xmath15 , see fig . ( [ bc])(a ) ) droplets move faster in lateral direction although the contact angle equals @xmath159 for all of them . in addition , the final position of the droplets is closer to the step edge for larger values of @xmath14 , eventually leading to a slight overhang . the small differences in @xmath165 for different values of @xmath14 is related to the fact that the shape of nanodroplets is not only determined by @xmath16 , as shown in fig . [ flat ] , and that the wetting film thickness depends on @xmath14 .       and @xmath200 , respectively . the droplets of size @xmath160 are initially positioned at a distance @xmath163 from the step . @xmath201 and @xmath10 result in an equilibrium contact angle @xmath159 . time evolution of the ( b ) horizontal position @xmath20 and ( c ) vertical position @xmath165 of the center of mass of the droplets relative to the step edge . since @xmath165 depends only weakly on @xmath5 only the case @xmath195 is shown . ]     on the dynamics of the droplets near an edge for the plus case and for an initial droplet shape with @xmath160 . the values of @xmath14 and @xmath15 , i.e. , i ( @xmath10 , @xmath201 ) and ii ( @xmath202 , @xmath203 ) are selected such that the equilibrium contact angle is @xmath159 in both cases .

[ edgeplus ] ]    even if they exhibit the same equal equilibrium contact angles @xmath16 the behavior of droplets in the plus case differs substantially from that in the minus case : the direction of motion is reversed . however , apart from this sign change , the influences of the step height , the equilibrium contact angle , and @xmath14 are similar . the dependence of the droplet dynamics on the step height for the plus case is shown in fig . [ effstepplus](a ) . the initial size of the droplets is @xmath160 and the contact angle @xmath159 ( with @xmath201 , @xmath10 ) . the corresponding lateral and vertical positions of the center of mass of the droplets relative to the step edge are shown in figs . [ effstepplus](b ) and [ effstepplus](c ) , respectively . as in the minus case the migration phase is preceded by a fast initial relaxation process ( during which @xmath165 drops slightly ) . however , the droplets are repelled from the step . the lateral speed of the motion continuously decreases as the distance of the droplets from the step edge increases . for higher steps the droplets are faster . but as in the minus case , the maximum speed ( reached for @xmath194 , i.e. , in the case of an isolated edge ) is almost reached for @xmath207 ( see fig .  [ effstepplus](b ) ) .    the results for different values of @xmath14 , while keeping the contact angle @xmath159 fixed , are depicted in fig . [ edgeplus](a ) . the corresponding lateral @xmath20 and vertical @xmath165 positions of the center of mass of the droplet relative to the step edge are given in figs . [ edgeplus](b ) and [ edgeplus](c ) , respectively . for all the cases considered the droplets move away from the step . however , as in the minus case , the droplet speed increases with @xmath14 ( i.e. , for less negative values of @xmath14 ) , even though the contact angle is not changed . the reason for this is , that larger ( i.e. , less negative ) values of @xmath14 require larger values of @xmath15 in order to maintain the same @xmath16 . as in the minus case the droplet height , i.e. , @xmath165 , depends on @xmath14 as well .      in ref . @xcite we have demonstrated that droplets near corners , i.e. , at the base of a step of infinite height , are attracted to the corner in the plus case and repelled from the corner in the minus case ( while in a macroscopic model taking into account only interface energies the free energy of the droplets is independent of their distance from the corner ) . in other words , the direction of motion is reversed as compared to the case of the edge . however , as we shall show in the following , at a step composed of an edge and a corner at its base , the direction of motion of nanodroplets is the same on both sides of the step . positioned at the base of topographic steps of different height for the minus case . the droplets start at a distance @xmath163 from the step . @xmath164 and @xmath8 correspond to @xmath159 . the dashed and the solid lines correspond to the configurations just after the initial relaxation at @xmath208 and to a later time @xmath209 , respectively . as function of time the horizontal position @xmath20 and the vertical position @xmath165 of the center of mass relative to the step base are shown in ( b ) and ( c ) , respectively . since @xmath165 depends only weakly on @xmath5 , in ( c ) only the trajectory for @xmath195 is shown . ] near a corner of substrates with different contact angles @xmath16 in the minus case . the top panel shows the initial droplet profile with @xmath210 . the other panels show the droplets after the initial relaxation ( @xmath211 ( i ) , @xmath212 ( ii ) , and @xmath213 ( iii ) , dashed lines ) and during the migration stage ( @xmath214 ( i ) , @xmath215 ( ii ) , and @xmath216 ( iii ) , solid lines ) for @xmath173 ( i , @xmath217 , @xmath8 ) , @xmath174 ( ii , @xmath218 , @xmath8 ) , and @xmath175 ( iii , @xmath219 , @xmath8 ) , respectively . the time evolution of the center of mass @xmath220 relative to the corner is shown in ( b ) and ( c ) for the lateral and vertical direction , respectively .

[ wedgediffhminus ] for droplets of size @xmath160 starting at a distance @xmath163 from the corner . the initial distance @xmath225 is chosen such that after the initial relaxation which precedes the migration phase the contact line facing the corner is well separated from the wetting layer on the vertical part of the step . for the minus case fig . [ wedgediffhminus](a ) presents the results of our stokes dynamics calculations for droplets at the step base for different step heights . the droplets are repelled from the step and move away with a speed which decreases continuously with the distance from the step . the differences in droplet speed are significant between step heights @xmath193 , 5 , and 10 ( see fig .  [ wedgediffhminus](b ) ) . increasing the step height further influences the dynamics of the droplets only at large distances from the step .    changing the equilibrium contact angle @xmath16 does not change the droplet dynamics qualitatively . this is demonstrated in fig . [ wedgediffcminus](a ) for droplets on substrates with different values of @xmath15 ( while keeping @xmath8 ) . the top panel shows the initial shape used in all cases considered here for the numerical solution of the stokes dynamics . the corresponding lateral position @xmath20 and vertical position @xmath165 of the center of mass of the droplets relative to the corner are depicted in figs . [ wedgediffcminus](b ) and [ wedgediffcminus](c ) , respectively . increasing @xmath16 ( by increasing @xmath15 ) results in faster droplet motion . since the initial droplet shape is not adapted to the modified contact angle @xmath226 , @xmath165 changes rapidly during the initial relaxation process for @xmath226 . the dynamics of droplets on substrates with the same contact angle @xmath159 but different values of @xmath14 ( with @xmath15 adapted accordingly ) is shown in fig . [ wedgediffb](a ) . the top panel shows the initial configuration . for all cases considered the droplets move away from the step . comparing @xmath198 for different values of @xmath14 ( see fig .  [ wedgediffb](b ) ) shows , that the droplet velocity increases with @xmath14 ( which , for fixed @xmath159 , implies increasing @xmath15 ) . after the initial relaxation process the vertical coordinate @xmath165 of the center of mass does not vary in time ( see fig .  [ wedgediffb](c ) ) . the droplet dynamics depends on the droplet size . this is demonstrated in fig . [ wedgedropsize ] for droplets of initial sizes @xmath224 and @xmath160 starting at @xmath227 near an isolated wedge for the minus case . the larger droplet moves faster because its two three - phase contact lines have a larger lateral distance from each other such that they experience a larger difference in the local disjoining pressure .       on substrates with @xmath159 ( @xmath201 and @xmath10 ) starting at @xmath163 on the base of steps with heights varying between @xmath193 ( top ) and @xmath194 ( bottom , corresponding to an isolated wedge ) right after the initial relaxation process at @xmath228 ( dashed lines ) and during the migration process at @xmath229 ( solid lines ) . the horizontal position @xmath20 and the vertical position @xmath165 of the center of mass are shown in ( b ) and ( c ) , respectively , as a function of time . ]     near isolated wedges ( @xmath194 ) in the plus case . @xmath159 on both substrates : ( i : @xmath10 , @xmath201 ) and ( ii : @xmath202 , @xmath203 ) . ( a ) the top panel shows the initial droplet shape and the lower panels show the droplets just after the initial relaxation at @xmath171 ( dashed lines ) and in their final configuration at @xmath230 and @xmath231 for substrate i and ii , respectively ( solid lines ) . the horizontal position @xmath20 and the vertical position @xmath165 of the center of the mass during the motion are shown in ( b ) and ( c ) , respectively . [ wedgediffbplus ] ]    in the plus case the direction of motion of the droplets is reversed as compared to the minus case . as shown in fig . [ wedgediffhplus](a ) , the migration speed increases with the step height , but the droplets stop before the leading contact line reaches the wedge such that the droplets do not move into the corner . as in the other cases discussed so far , the droplet speed increases significantly as the step height is increased up to @xmath195 . in fig . [ wedgediffhplus](b ) the trajectories @xmath198 for @xmath195 and for @xmath194 almost coincide . the final distance of the droplets from the wedge decreases with the step height , but it remains finite in the limit @xmath232 . once the droplets reach the wedge there is a brief drop of @xmath165 due to fluid leaking out of the droplet into the corner area . after that their vertical position @xmath165 of the center of mass increases again ( see fig .  [ wedgediffhplus](c ) ) . this increase is the result of a contraction of the droplets , which is also observed for droplets on the top side of steps in the minus case and which is more pronounced for higher steps .    changing @xmath14 and @xmath15 such that @xmath159 remains the same does not change the dynamics of the droplets qualitatively . higher values of @xmath14 and @xmath15 result in larger droplet velocities ( see fig . [ wedgediffbplus ] concerning the example of droplets near an isolated wedge ) . beside this change of droplet speed we find that for larger values of @xmath15 the final position of the droplets is closer to the step and the final height @xmath165 of their center of mass is larger . the magnitude of the disjoining pressure and therefore the forces acting on the droplet increase with @xmath15 . in response to these forces the droplets deform more upon increasing @xmath15 .      in the previous subsections we have discussed the behavior of nanodroplets originally positioned at a certain lateral distance from topographic features such as edges , wedges , and steps . their behavior suggests that these surface features provide migration barriers for droplets . even in those situations in which droplets migrate towards the edge or wedge , respectively , they stop just before reaching them . this result is also borne out in a macroscopic model which takes into account only interface energies : the free energy of a droplet positioned right on an edge is larger than that of a droplet of equal volume residing on a flat and homogeneous substrate , and the free energy of a drop in the corner of a wedge is even lower . as a consequence , we expect that droplets sitting on edges to be in an unstable and droplets sitting inside the corner of a wedge to be in a stable configuration . moving , by force , a droplet ( with the shape of the liquid - vapor interface remaining a part of a circle ) in the first case slightly to one side results in an increased contact angle on this side , while the contact angle on the other side decreases . however , with the leading contact angle being larger than the equilibrium one the corresponding contact line will move away from the edge , while the trailing contact line ( with the corresponding contact angle being smaller than the equilibrium one ) moves towards the edge . as a consequence , the droplet leaves its position at the edge . in the case of a droplet in a wedge , the situation is reversed : moving , by force , the droplet into one direction results in a decreased contact angle on this side and an increased contact angle at the trailing side , such that the droplet moves back into the corner of the wedge . accordingly one expects that a certain force has to be applied to push a droplet over an edge or to pull it out of the corner of a wedge . in the following our detailed numerical results indicate that this also holds for nanodroplets and they enable us to quantify those external forces . our analyses show that a nanodroplet positioned symmetrically on the tip of an edge is unstable on all types of substrates , regardless of whether the droplets migrate towards the edge or away from the edge ( see fig . [ overedge ] ; there a suitable , highly symmetric initial shape of the liquid - vapor interface has been chosen such that it indeed relaxes to the unstable state of a droplet sitting on the tip of the edge ) . due to the mirror symmetry with respect to the diagonal of the edge , a droplet right at the tip of an isolated edge is in mechanical equilibrium but in an unstable one . in the minus case , after a small perturbation the droplet flips either up or down but then rests next to the step , i.e. , in the position which it would assumes upon migrating towards the edge ( fig . [ overedge](a ) ) . in the plus case , as expected from the previous results the droplet migrates away from the edge after flipping to either side ( fig . [ overedge](b ) ) . at steps of finite height , this symmetry is broken by the presence of the wedge . in the minus case , the droplets are pushed away from the wedge , i.e. , upwards , which is consistent with the dynamics of droplets in the vicinity of isolated wedges of the same material . however , being attracted to the edge as shown in the previous subsections , they come to rest with the trailing contact line pinned to the step edge ( fig .  [ overedge](c ) ) . in the plus case the droplets move in the opposite direction , i.e. , they are attracted by the wedge which they migrate to after leaving the edge area ( fig . [ overedge](d ) ) .    in order to displace a droplet from one side of an edge to the other side ( as shown in fig . [ edgeforce](a ) ) one has to apply an external force , e.g. , a body force such as gravity or centrifugal forces , which we incorporate into the hydrodynamic equations via the boundary condition ( see eq . ( [ eq : surfacebc ] ) ) . if the applied force is small the droplets assume a new but distorted equilibrium position with the leading three - phase contact line still pinned at the edge . but there exists a threshold force density @xmath233 beyond which the configuration described above is unstable and the leading three - phase contact line depins from the step edge . as a consequence the droplet flips around the corner and ends up on the vertical side of the edge . since the applied body force has no component parallel to this vertical part of the substrate , the further fate of the droplet is determined by the action of the intermolecular forces . in the minus case considered in fig . [ edgeforce](a ) the droplet is attracted to the edge such that the new stable equilibrium configuration is that of a droplet residing on the vertical part of the step with the trailing three - phase contact line pinned at the step edge . in the plus case ( which we have not tested numerically ) the droplet is repelled from the edge and it is expected to move down the vertical part of the edge . as shown in fig .  [ edgeforce](b ) we have determined the body force density @xmath40 needed to push the droplets over the edge for various types of substrates ( minus case with @xmath8 ) and for droplets of two different sizes . the threshold force density @xmath233 decreases both with @xmath15 ( i.e. , with @xmath16 ) and with the droplet size . both trends are also expected to occur for macroscopic droplets . in the limit @xmath234 the droplets loose contact with the substrate and the free energy of the droplet at the edge equals the free energy on a planar substrate . taking , however , the finite range of molecular interactions into account this no longer holds , but the barrier still decreases with increasing @xmath16 . since the force density @xmath40 is a body force , i.e. , a force density , the total force per unit ridge length @xmath235 ( with the ridge cross - sectional area @xmath236 ) acting on the droplet is proportional to the droplet cross - sectional area @xmath19 . in fig .  [ edgeforce](b ) we observe that the total threshold force @xmath237 needed to push droplets over the edge increases with the droplet volume . apart from the effects of long - ranged intermolecular forces the main contribution to the barrier effect of the edge is the increase of the liquid - vapor surface area when the droplet is deformed as it passes over the edge . the square root of the ratio of the surface tension coefficient @xmath38 and the body force density @xmath40 defines a capillary length below which the surface tension dominates , while it is less important for larger drops . ( the surface area of three - dimensional droplets increases only quadratically with the droplet radius @xmath47 while the volume increases @xmath238 . ) from dimensional arguments @xmath239 one expects the threshold body force density @xmath233 needed to push droplets over an edge to decrease @xmath240 with the droplet radius , while for liquid ridges the total force per unit length @xmath237 should still increase linearly with the droplet radius @xmath47 . therefore the total threshold force @xmath237 needed for the larger droplet in fig .  [ edgeforce](b ) should be about @xmath241 times the force needed for the smaller drop . the actual value is somewhat smaller and we attribute the difference to the effect of the long - ranged part of the intermolecular forces .     and @xmath8 ) and in the ( b ) plus case ( @xmath201 and @xmath10 ) . a tiny perturbation at @xmath242 pushes the droplet either up or down the step . after that in the minus case the droplet stays next to the step ( a ) whereas in the plus case ( b ) it moves away from the edge ( solid lines , @xmath243 and @xmath244 in ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively ) . in the presence of a wedge , i.e. , for a finite step height @xmath5 , the droplet is ( c ) pushed onto the top side of the step in the minus case but ( d ) towards the corner of the step in the plus case ( solid lines , @xmath245 and @xmath246 in ( c ) and ( d ) , respectively ) . ]     pushed over an edge ( minus case , @xmath8 and @xmath218 ) by an external , horizontal body force @xmath247 ( @xmath248 , direction indicated by the horizontal arrow ) . droplet shapes for @xmath242 ( indicated ) , 100 , 650 , 1050 , 1150 , and 6950 are shown ( from the upper left to the lower right ) .

( b ) the minimum total force per unit ridge length @xmath281 required to extract the droplet from the corner as a function of @xmath15 for droplets of cross - sectional area @xmath265 ( corresponding to @xmath282 , dashed line ) and @xmath283 ( corresponding to @xmath284 , solid line ) in the minus case ( @xmath8 ) . the values @xmath9 , @xmath273 , @xmath285 , and @xmath270 correspond to @xmath257 , @xmath258 , @xmath174 , and @xmath175 , respectively . the force density @xmath40 is measured in units of @xmath259 . ] a macroscopic droplet spanning the whole topographic step ( i.e. , with one contact line on the top terrace and one on the base terrace ) moves downhill : since the surface of a macroscopic droplet is a part of a circle which is cut by the top side of the step at a higher level than by the base of the step the contact angle at the upper terrace is smaller than the contact angle at the lower terrace . this results in a net driving force in downhill direction . the final configuration is a droplet with the upper contact line pinned at the step edge . this is also true on the nano scale , as demonstrated in figs . [ overwedge](a ) and [ overwedge](b ) for the minus case and in figs . [ overwedge](d ) and [ overwedge](e ) for the plus case . the latter indicates that the difference in contact angle at the two contact lines due to the different height level at the top side and at the base side of the step provides a stronger driving force than the lateral action of the disjoining pressure which , in the plus case , moves droplets positioned next to the step in uphill direction .    for all substrates the surface of droplets pinned at the edge becomes convex ( corresponding to a negative pressure in the droplet ) for small @xmath16 ( i.e. , small @xmath15 , see @xmath268 in figs .  [ overwedge](c ) and [ overwedge](f ) ) . for very large @xmath16 the upper contact line depins from the edge and moves down towards the wedge ( see @xmath286 in figs . [ overwedge](c ) and [ overwedge](f ) ) . the result is a droplet sitting in the corner of the wedge area only . the critical value for @xmath16 between both types of configurations depends on the droplet volume and the step height : the smaller the droplet ( as compared to the step height ) the smaller is the value of @xmath16 at which the upper contact line depins and the larger the volume the smaller is the value of @xmath16 at which the droplet surface becomes convex . both phenomena are in qualitative agreement with macroscopic considerations which take into account interface energies only ( see refs . @xcite ) . droplets sitting in the corner of a wedge are in an energetically rather favorable situation as illustrated by the arguments given at the beginning of this subsection . however , even in the plus case , for which droplets are attracted by wedges , they stop before reaching the wedge and they do not move into the corner of the wedge . in any case , there is an energy barrier to overcome in order to move droplets out of wedges , as shown in fig . [ wedgeforce](a ) . if a small horizontal force is applied to a droplet sitting in the corner of a wedge it assumes a new , slightly distorted but stable shape . but there exists a threshold force density @xmath233 above which the distorted configuration becomes unstable and the droplet moves out of the corner . in the minus case considered in fig . [ wedgeforce ] , the droplet is repelled from the wedge such that the effect of the intermolecular forces adds to the external driving force and the droplet definitively moves out of the corner of the wedge . in contrast to the force required to push droplets over an edge , @xmath233 increases with @xmath15 ( i.e. , with @xmath16 ) . the total force per unit ridge length @xmath249 required to pull a droplet out of a wedge increases only slightly ( i.e. , less than linearly ) with the droplet volume ( see fig . [ wedgeforce](b ) ) , so that accordingly the required force density @xmath233 decreases significantly with volume . with the same dimensional arguments used above for droplets being pushed over edges one would expect the total force needed to pull two droplets of different volume out of the corner of a wedge to be proportional to the square root of the volume ratio . in particular for small @xmath287 according to fig . [ wedgeforce](b ) the total threshold force is almost independent of the droplet size , rather than to increase by a factor @xmath288 . we attribute this difference to the influence of the long - ranged part of the intermolecular forces . numerical solutions of the stokes dynamics of nanodroplets in the vicinity of edges , wedges , and steps are rather time consuming , even when using advanced numerical methods . as shown in fig . [ comppisigma](b ) , the main driving force for the migration of droplets is the disjoining pressure induced force density @xmath289 as defined in eq . ( [ dpforce ] ) . after the initial relaxation process , the shapes of the droplets hardly change during the migration process until the droplets either reach the edge ( minus case ) or the corner of the wedge area ( plus case ) . unfortunately the relaxed shape of the droplet is not available analytically , but for droplets on substrates with @xmath290 as mostly considered here the initial shape relaxations are rather mild . accordingly , as demonstrated in the following , the force on the droplets can be estimated rather accurately from calculating @xmath289 for droplets with a shape given by the initial profile in eq . ( [ inicond ] ) positioned at the distance @xmath49 from the edge or from the corner of the wedge . apparently this estimate becomes invalid for @xmath291 . figures  [ dropsize](a ) and [ dropsize](b ) show the disjoining pressure induced force densities calculated along these lines for droplets of size @xmath160 and @xmath292 as a function of the distance @xmath225 of the right contact line to an edge for the minus and the plus case , respectively . since @xmath289 is proportional to @xmath15 only results for @xmath9 are shown . for the plus case the force is always negative for both droplet sizes and at all distances from the edge , with its strength increasing towards the edge . this means that droplets should move away from the edge with a speed which decreases continuously . this is in complete agreement with the numerical results presented in the previous section . for the minus case and for sufficiently large values of @xmath14 , the force is positive in accordance with the numerical results . however , as shown in fig . [ dropsize](a ) , for very small values of @xmath14 , i.e. , for @xmath293 the force in the direct vicinity of the edge becomes negative and droplets are expected to move away from the edge . indeed , as demonstrated in fig . [ edgediffb](b ) ( @xmath294 for i lies below the corresponding values for ii and iii ) , the final distance of the droplets from the step edge in the minus case increases with more negative values of @xmath14 . on the other hand , as shown in the following subsec . [ direction ] , for large distances from the edge , in the minus case even for arbitrarily small @xmath14 the force is positive so that droplets find an equilibrium position with vanishing force at a significant distance from the edge . the sign of the disjoining pressure induced force density does not depend on the droplet size . however , the equilibrium position changes as a function of droplet size . the force calculated for droplets of the same size but in the vicinity of a wedge for the minus and the plus case are shown in figs . [ dropsize](c ) and [ dropsize](d ) , respectively . for the minus case the force is positive for any droplet size and for any @xmath14 , which means that the droplets move away from the wedge . for the plus case the force is negative at large distances , but it changes sign close to the wedge at a distance which increases with decreasing the size of the droplets and with decreasing the value of @xmath14 . the latter relation is in agreement with the numerical results presented in fig . [ wedgediffbplus](b ) . the disjoining pressure induced force density @xmath289 presented in fig .  [ dropsize ] has beeen calculated for droplets with a shape given by eq . ( [ inicond ] ) , i.e. , for droplets with equal height and half width . however , the substrate parameters used in fig . [ dropsize ] do not necessarily lead to @xmath159 , and droplets would adopt a very different shape even during the migration process . in order to check the influence of the droplet shape on the calculated disjoining pressure induced force density @xmath289 we also consider droplets which have a width @xmath295 different from their height @xmath47 ( compare with eq . ( [ inicond ] ) ) : @xmath296^{|x-\bar{x}|^m+1}.\ ] ] figure  [ profsize ] compares the disjoining pressure induced force density @xmath289 on droplets in the vicinity of edges and wedges in both the minus and the plus case for different drop widths @xmath295 but for a fixed drop height @xmath160 . the results indicate that the form of the droplets does not change the sign of @xmath289 , and in particular in the vicinity of the wedge the droplet width has a rather small influence on the force .    in the vicinity of topographic steps the dependence of @xmath289 on the step height @xmath5 is also in good agreement with the results of the full numerical solution of the stokes dynamics . figure  [ stepsize ] shows @xmath289 above and below the step on substrates of the minus and plus type for step heights ranging from @xmath193 to @xmath186 ( i.e. , to isolated edges and wedges ) . the absolute value of the force increases with the step height with the force near isolated edges and wedges as the limiting values . this limiting value is almost reached for a step height @xmath195 ( not shown in fig . [ stepsize ] ) . ( in units of @xmath169 ) on droplets of size @xmath160 and @xmath297 in the vicinity of an edge ( ( a ) and ( b ) ) and a wedge ( ( c ) and ( d ) ) on substrates of the minus ( ( a ) and ( c ) ) and the plus ( ( b ) and ( d ) ) type with @xmath9 and various values of @xmath14 as indicated in the boxes as a function of the distance @xmath225 from the edge or the corner of the wedge . [ dropsize ] ]     ( in units of @xmath169 ) on droplets of height @xmath160 and widths @xmath298 and @xmath299 in the vicinity of an edge ( ( a ) and ( b ) ) and a wedge ( ( c ) and ( d ) ) on substrates of the minus ( ( a ) and ( c ) ) and the plus ( ( b ) and ( d ) ) type with @xmath9 and various values of @xmath14 as indicated in the boxes as a function of the distance @xmath225 from the edge or wedge . [ profsize ] ]     ( in units of @xmath169 ) on droplets of size @xmath300 on the top side ( ( a ) and ( b ) ) and on the bottom side ( ( c ) and ( d ) ) of steps of various heights @xmath5 with substrates of the minus ( @xmath179 , ( a ) and ( c ) ) and the plus ( @xmath10 , ( b ) and ( d ) ) type with @xmath9 as a function of the distance @xmath225 from the step . [ stepsize ] ]      both the force calculations presented in the previous subsection as well as the results of the numerical solution of the mesoscopic hydrodynamic equations indicate , that the direction of motion of a nanodroplet far enough from the step does not depend on whether the droplet is positioned on the top side or on the bottom side of the step . in the minus case the droplets move in downhill direction ( i.e. , in the direction of positive @xmath11-values ) and in the plus case in the opposite direction , independent of the step height and of the values of @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( where the latter has to be positive ) . in order to understand this we further analyze the total force per unit ridge length @xmath18 on liquid ridges as defined in eq . ( [ dpforce ] ) for large droplets far from the step . asymptotically for large @xmath301 the djp reduces to its value on a flat substrate so that there the wetting film thickness assumes its value @xmath3 independent of @xmath11 up to @xmath302 . the leading order correction to the djp is @xmath303 for the plus and minus case , respectively . parameterizing the shape of the liquid - vapor interface to the left and to the right of the droplet apex by @xmath304 and @xmath305 , respectively , from eq . ( [ dpforce ] ) with @xmath306 we obtain : @xmath307\nonumber\\ & \approx & \pm { \mbox{sign}}(x)\,\int_{y_0}^{y_m } \frac{9\,h\,c}{16}\,\left [ \frac{1}{x_r(y)^4}-\frac{1}{x_\ell(y)^4 } \right]\,dy\nonumber\\ & \approx & \mp \frac{9\,h\,c}{16\,|\bar{x}|^5}\,\int_{y_0}^{y_m}\left [ x_r(y)-x_\ell(y)\right]\,dy=\mp \frac{9\,h\,c}{16\,|\bar{x}|^5}\,a_d\/ , \label{flimit0}\end{aligned}\ ] ] with the droplet apex height @xmath21 . in the last but one step we have approximated @xmath308 with @xmath309 . the force is proportional to the droplet cross - sectional area and its sign is determined by the sign of the hamaker constant ( i.e. , depending on the case ; plus or minus ) only : in the plus case the force is negative ( upper sign ) and in the minus case it is positive ( lower sign ) . this is in complete agreement with the numerical data . however , other than suggested by eq . ( [ flimit0 ] ) , the force on a droplet does not diverge in the limit @xmath232 as this limit has to be taken before taking the limit @xmath310 .    at large distances from an isolated wedge as well as from an isolated edge , the disjoining pressure is to leading order given by the djp of the corresponding homogeneous substrate with @xmath311 as the leading order correction for the plus and the minus case , respectively . as in the case of the step , up to this order the thickness of the wetting film is independent of the ( large ) distances from the edge or wedge . using the same approximations as in the case of the step of finite height , the force on a droplet at a distance @xmath312 from an edge is given by @xmath313 with the upper sign corresponding to the plus case and the lower sign to the minus case . the sign of the force is the same as in the case of a step and it is also proportional to the droplet volume . however , it decreases less rapidly with the distance from the step .    for very large , almost macroscopic droplets , the situation is again different from the previous two . in the following we follow the line of arguments developed in refs . @xcite for droplets in the vicinity of chemical steps . in this limit the droplets are approximately symmetric with respect to their apex and the main contribution to the force stems from the vicinity of the contact lines . for the wetting film as well as near the apex the @xmath11-component @xmath314 of the surface normal vector is zero and thus in the vicinity of the apex the djp is negligibly small . in most of the examples discussed here the equilibrium contact angle @xmath16 is about @xmath191 and , as a consequence , the lateral width of the contact lines ( i.e. , the range of @xmath11-values within which the drop profile crosses over to the flat one of the wetting film ) is small and the lateral variation of the djp within this region is negligible . therefore , after parameterizing the droplet surface in the vicinity of the left and right contact line ( at @xmath315 and @xmath316 , respectively ) by the corresponding function @xmath317 , the total force on a droplet can be approximated by @xmath318 \\   & = & -\phi(\bar{x}-a , y_0)+\phi(\bar{x}+a , y_0)\approx 2\,a\ , \partial_x \phi(\bar{x},y_0 ) , \label{forcemi}\end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath319 is the local effective interface potential at the level @xmath3 of the wetting film ( on the top side of the step one has to add @xmath5 to @xmath3 ) . extending eq . ( [ eqtheta ] ) to inhomogeneous substrates one can define a spatially varying `` equilibrium contact angle '' @xmath320 . in this sense , a droplet in the vicinity of a topographic step is exposed to an effective chemical wettability gradient which it follows . expanding @xmath321 for large @xmath301 yields @xmath322 with the upper sign corresponding to the plus case and the lower sign to the minus case . the force is equal on both sides of the step and it increases linearly with the step height but it decreases rather rapidly with the distance from the step , however , more slowly than in the case of nanodroplets . the force increases linearly with the base width @xmath323 rather than with the cross - sectional area @xmath19 . as in the case of nanodroplets the actual force on a droplet does not diverge in the limit @xmath232 . using the same approximations as in the case of the step of finite height , the force on a droplet at a distance @xmath301 from an isolated edge is given by @xmath324 with the upper sign corresponding to the plus case and the lower sign to the minus case . in the vicinity of a wedge the situation is more complicated . in order to obtain as in eq . ( [ forcemi ] ) the effective interface potential , the point @xmath325 corresponding to the upper limit of the integral there has to correspond to a point at infinite distance from the substrate . however , taking @xmath2 to @xmath186 for a fixed value @xmath20 does not change the distance from the vertical part of the wedge . at this point it is not clear whether the force integral in eq . ( [ dpforce ] ) can be approximated by the form given in eq . ( [ forcemi ] ) because the basic assumption , that the disjoining pressure is negligible at the apex , is probably not true . expanding the force as calculated from eq . ( [ forcemi ] ) for large distances from a step of very large height one obtains terms of the order @xmath326 competing with terms of order @xmath327 , which indicates that in the case of a wedge the approximations eq .  ( [ forcemi ] ) is based on lead to a mathematically ill - posed problem .    in all cases @xmath27 essentially depends on the ratio of the step height @xmath5 and the distance from the step @xmath20 as well as on the ratio of the apex height @xmath21 and @xmath20 . the asymptotic results are summarized in fig . [ asymptofig ] . @xmath27 varies according to a power law @xmath22 , @xmath328 , of the distance from the step . for finite sized droplet and steps of finite height ( @xmath329 and @xmath330 ) we obtain the fastest decay with @xmath331 . for almost macroscopic droplets ( @xmath332 ) in the vicinity of finite sized steps and for nanodroplets near isolated edges and wedges one has @xmath24 . for large drops ( @xmath25 ) next to an isolated edge we get the weakest decay with @xmath26 . in any case , the total force per unit length @xmath27 is proportional to the hamaker constant as observed in the numerical solution of the mesoscopic stokes dynamics as well as in the force analysis presented in subec .  [ force ] . the total disjoining pressure induced force per unit ridge length @xmath18 at large distance from steps depends on two length ratios @xmath333 and @xmath334 ( the cross - sectional area @xmath19 is proportional to @xmath335 ) . this figure summarizes the analytical results obtained in subsec . [ direction ] . ]      the driving force @xmath336 on the droplets is balanced by viscous forces . by applying a simple analysis within the lubrication approximation one can show that the rate of energy dissipation is proportional to the square of the velocity @xmath337 of the droplets @xcite . the form of this dependence can be expected to hold also for droplets with large contact angles on the basis of analyticity and symmetry arguments . by equating this dissipation with the work @xmath338 done by the driving force one finds @xmath339 for droplets far from the step with @xmath340 given by eqs . ( [ flimit1 ] ) and ( [ flimit2 ] ) as a power law one has @xmath341 and therefore @xmath342 with @xmath343 for large droplets in the vicinity of edges , @xmath344 for large droplets in the vicinity of steps of finite height as well as for nanodroplets near isolated edges and wedges , and @xmath345 for nanodroplets near steps of finite height . @xmath73 is a constant which also depends on whether there is an edge , wedge , or a step and whether the droplet is large or small . the functional form given by eq . ( [ xt ] ) with the corresponding value of @xmath346 can be fitted to the positions of nanodroplets as a function of time obtained by numerically solving the mesoscopic hydrodynamic equations , e.g. , to the data shown in fig . [ effstepplus ] ( droplet on the top side of steps , plus case ) and fig . [ wedgediffhminus ] ( droplet on the step base , minus case ) . however , the numerically available range of @xmath20 values is rather small so that the fits are consistent with the above values of @xmath346 but can not rule out different ones . in addition , it is not clear whether the distances considered in the numerical solutions of the mesoscopic hydrodynamic equations are large enough to reach the asymptotic regime considered here , and whether the droplets should be considered small or large in the above sense . a major and obvious driving force for studying the dynamics of nanodroplets on structured substrates is the rapid development and miniaturization of microfluidic devices , in particular of open microfluidic devices @xcite . but this is not the only research area for which a detailed understanding of the influence of the long - ranged part of the intermolecular interactions on fluids in the vicinity of lateral surface structures might be important . another example is the dynamics of nanodroplets at chemical surface structures as discussed in refs . moreover , dewetting processes are also strongly influenced by surface heterogeneities , both during the initial phase of film breakup @xcite as well as during hole growth @xcite . the latter example is particularly interesting in this respect because it reveals an intrinsic nanoscopic length scale which has to be understood : the receding contact line is pinned only by steps of a minimum height which increases with the size of the liquid molecules @xcite  a clear indication that details of the intermolecular interactions in the vicinity of the step are relevant . all results presented in this article have been obtained for homogeneous straight liquid ridges . apart from the fact that such ridges are unstable with respect to breaking up into three - dimensional droplets @xcite , the question remains to check how relevant these results are for actual three - dimensional droplets . in this context we point out that the basic driving mechanism for droplets in the vicinity of steps is the difference of the disjoining pressure on that side of the droplet which is closer to the step and the side which is further away from the step . in such a situation also three - dimensional droplets move . however , the third dimension certainly changes the behavior of droplets spanning topographic steps @xcite : depending on the droplet volume , the droplet can spread along the step into a cigar shaped configuration . the influence of the long - ranged part of the intermolecular interactions on this phenomenon has not yet been studied . it is worthwhile to point out that , although the dynamics is different , there are strong similarities between nanodroplets and solid nanoclusters : their energetics on structured surfaces is determined by intermolecular forces as demonstrated in ref . @xcite by molecular dynamics simulations of gold clusters on graphite surfaces . unfortunately , in such simulations taking into account the long - ranged component of the intermolecular forces increases the numerical cost drastically , such that most of the effects discussed here are not accessible by molecular dynamics simulations @xcite . this leaves the question of experimental tests of our theoretical predictions presented here . as detailed in ref . @xcite the forces on the nanodroplets are of the order of @xmath347  n ( i.e. , about eight orders of magnitude stronger than the gravitational force on such a droplet ) and the resulting velocities range between @xmath348 and @xmath349 for viscosities between @xmath350 and @xmath351 . while topographic surface structures of almost any type can be produced with modern lithographic techniques , positioning nanodroplets with nanometer accuracy next to a step remains a tough challenge . most promising are techniques based on using atomic force microscopes as pens @xcite , but there are no experiments available yet . experimentally it is much easier to grow droplets from an aerosol or a vapor phase rather than to deposit them at a specific location . experimentally it has been shown , that water nanodroplets preferentially condense onto terrace steps of vicinal surfaces @xcite . however , these data do not allow one to determine whether the droplets reside on the top terrace , on the bottom terrace , or whether they span the step . this example shows , that condensation on ( and evaporation from ) nano - structured substrates is a challenging problem of its own . from the step . the boundary of the system @xmath352 decomposes into three different groups : liquid - liquid ( @xmath353 ) , liquid - solid ( @xmath354 ) , and liquid - vapor ( @xmath355 ) interfaces . the discretized node points considered in the numerical investigation are indicated ; @xmath36 and @xmath356 represents the normal and the tangential unit vectors on @xmath352 , respectively . ]    in order to study the effect of the intermolecular forces on nanodroplets near a topographic step we solve eqs . ( [ eq : stokes])([eq : surfacebc ] ) numerically using a standard and accurate biharmonic boundary integral method ( bbim ) @xcite . to this end we introduce the stream function @xmath357 so that @xmath358 and @xmath359 as well as the vorticity @xmath360 which allows us to reformulate the dimensionless versions of eqs . ( [ eq : stokes ] ) and ( [ eq : incomp ] ) in terms the following harmonic and biharmonic equations @xcite : @xmath361 and @xmath362    the standard bbim relies on mapping the equations for @xmath363 and @xmath364 onto the boundary @xmath365 of the fluid , parameterized in terms of its contour length parameter @xmath72 . this results in an integral equation for @xmath363 , @xmath364 , and their derivatives @xmath366 and @xmath367 , with the surface normal vector pointing outwards of the liquid . by dividing the boundary of the system into a series of elements ( see fig . [ numfig ] ) one obtains a coupled system of algebraic equations which can be solved numerically . with the tangential velocity @xmath368 and the normal velocity @xmath369 ( with the index @xmath72 indicating the derivative in the direction tangential to the boundary ) the position of the liquid boundary after a time step can be calculated via the explicit euler scheme @xcite : @xmath370 in order to solve these equations the boundary conditions of the system must be expressed in terms of @xmath363 and @xmath364 . depending on the phases in contact with each other , three different types of boundary interfaces can be identified ( see fig . [ numfig ] ) : liquid - solid interfaces @xmath44 , liquid - liquid interfaces ( those boundaries @xmath371 and @xmath372 which are located at the end sides of the system ) , and liquid - vapor interfaces @xmath35 . for @xmath44 we impose the no - slip condition ( @xmath373 ) which corresponds to @xmath374 and @xmath375 . for @xmath371 and @xmath372 we apply a no - flux condition which corresponds to having a vertical symmetry plane there . such a system corresponds to a periodic repetition of the system attached to its mirror image . correspondingly the slope of the liquid - vapor interface at the side ends of the system is zero . these conditions can be implemented by setting @xmath374 and @xmath376 there . the tangential and the normal component of the boundary condition ( [ eq : surfacebc ] ) along the liquid - vapor interface @xmath35 in terms of the stream function and the vorticity read ( lower indices @xmath72 indicate derivatives with respect to the contour length parameter @xmath72 ) @xmath377 and @xmath378 respectively , with the local curvature @xmath379    in order to increase the efficiency of the numerical calculations we employ an adaptive time stepping : for any numerical step , the time step is selected such that the displacement of any node does not exceed @xmath380 percents of the length of the elements connected to that node ; @xmath380 can be changed during the numerical calculations . the starting value for @xmath380 and the rate of its increase depends on the actual situation but typically we have started with @xmath381 and then gradually increased it to 0.1 or even more . in order to avoid numerical instabilities , the position of the end points of the boundary elements are smoothed after a specified number of steps by fitting a spline through the points on the liquid - vapor interface , followed by selecting new and equally spaced points on the spline . dupuis a and yeomans j  m in ed . bubak m , van albada g  d , sloot p  m  a and dongarra j  j , _ computational science - iccs 2004 _ vol . lecture notes in computer science _ pp . 556563 berlin 2004 .","The text discusses the wetting behavior of liquids on solid substrates, specifically focusing on the dynamics of nanodroplets near topographic features such as edges, wedges, and steps.

"this paper considers ( multivariate ) generating functions of the form : _ n=1^ _ g [ n ] ( g ) s^e(g ) , [ eq : genfn ] where @xmath2 indicates a subclass of graphs . @xmath3 is the number of edges a graph @xmath4 . @xmath5 $ ] indicates that the graph has vertex set @xmath6 $ ] and @xmath7 is a specified positive graph weight . the exponents of the variables @xmath8 and @xmath9 indicate the size of the vertex set , respectively , the number of edges . when evaluating at @xmath10 , there are some remarkable cancellations , leading , in some cases , to simple formul for the coefficients . this paper gives combinatorial explanations for the class of two - connected graphs in particular . two - connected graphs are those graphs for which we can remove any vertex and its incident edges and the resulting graph remains connected . there are four cases of used in mayer s theory of cluster and virial expansions , depending on the class of graphs considered and the weights . the sum is either over connected graphs , denoted by @xmath11 , or two - connected graphs , denoted by @xmath12 . the weights are either those for a discrete hard core gas , often referred to as the one - particle hard core gas , or for a continuum one - dimensional hard core gas , also named the tonks gas . for the discrete gas , the goal is to count the number of graphs ; for the continuum model , the coefficients are given by the volume of a polytope associated with the graph @xmath4 . we write a graph @xmath4 as the ordered pair of its vertex set and edge set as @xmath13 . we define the polytope corresponding to the graph @xmath4 as : _ g : = \{()_[2,n]^n-1 |_i-_j|<1 \{i , j } e(g ) } [ eq : graphpolytope ] , with @xmath14 . we use the notation @xmath15}:=(x_2 , \cdots , x_n)$ ] . mayer , in @xcite , established important connections between weighted graph generating functions and expansions in statistical mechanics . these connections are also presented in the framework of combinatorial species of structure in the work of ducharme , labelle and leroux @xcite , leroux and kaouche @xcite and faris @xcite . the results of mayer are that the weighted sum over connected graphs gives the pressure as a function of activity and the weighted sum over two - connected graphs is related to the virial expansion of pressure expanded in terms of density . the two formul are : @xmath16 } w(g ) \\ \beta p(\rho ) & = \rho - \sum\limits_{n=2}^{\infty}(n-1 ) \frac{\rho^n}{n ! } \sum\limits_{g \in \mathcal{b}[n]}w(g ) , \end{aligned}\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the graph weight specified by the particular model . the answers for the four cases are given by the formul for the connected graph discrete case : _ g [ n](-1)^e(g)= ( -1)^n-1(n-1 ) ! and for the connected graph continuum case : _ g [ n](-1)^e(g)(_g ) = ( -1)^n-1n^n-1 . there are also formul for the two - connected discrete case : _ g [ n](-1)^e(g)=-(n-2 ) ! [ eq : virial1phc ] and the two - connected graph continuum case : _ g [ n](-1)^e(g)(_g)=-n(n-2 ) ! [ eq : virialtg ] .for the discrete cases the results are straightforward computations . for the continuum case , derivations are given in @xcite . the statistical mechanical background is explained in full detail in section [ sec : models ] . it is tempting to try and find a simple combinatorial interpretation that explains the cancellations in a direct way . this was posed as a challenge in the paper of ducharme , labelle and leroux @xcite . in the connected graph cases , this was done by bernardi @xcite . the approach was to use an involution that exhibits the result of the almost perfect cancellation as a contribution from the fixed points of the involution . the fixed points were identified as increasing trees in the discrete case and rooted trees in the continuum case . the purpose of this paper is to present similar derivations for the two - connected graph cases . as always this is considerably more complicated . the concept of using an involution to understand the cancellations is natural . recall the formula that , for any finite non - empty set @xmath18 , we have : _ s x(-1)^|s|=0 . in order to prove this , we show we have the same number of sets with even cardinality as we do of odd cardinality . one approach is to pair sets differing by one element . this pairing idea is captured by the involution . in this example , the involution is defined by first fixing a singleton subset of @xmath18 , say @xmath19 , and taking the symmetric difference @xmath20 . if we consider a fixed vertex set @xmath5 $ ] for a graph , then a graph @xmath4 is determined precisely by its edge set @xmath21 , which are subsets of the collection of unordered pairs in @xmath5 $ ] , denoted @xmath5^{(2)}$ ] . we can also use this symmetric difference operation on the edge set for graphs . an important complication is that we consider particular subsets for which taking the symmetric difference with a fixed edge will not suffice , since the removal or addition of the edge may take us outside of the prescribed collection of subsets . we need to find an efficient way of choosing an edge based on the graph we are considering so that we obtain a pairing that will not take us outside of the prescribed collection .    in section [ sec : results ] , we present the combinatorial structures that give the interpretations of the cancellations in the two - connected case . sections [ sec:1phcinv ] and [ sec : chcginv ] give the proofs of the one particle hard core and the tonks gas case respectively . in the latter , the decomposition of polytopes into unimodular simplices attributed to lass is given so that it may be proved as an extension of the previous case . we provide an interpretation why @xmath22 should appear as the number of edges in section [ sec : structure ] .    from the perspective of statistical mechanics , the motivation for understanding such cancellations is to be able to adapt the understanding to models where more complicated weights are used . indeed , the key idea is to emulate what is done for the connections between connected graphs and trees and understand how to modify these in this context . the first parallel to draw is that the involution of bernardi fits within a general concept of externally and internally active elements of a set with a matroid structure as given by bjrner and sokal @xcite . the idea to emphasise here is that this allows the set of connected graphs to be partitioned into subsets , indexed by trees . when we consider graphs with the partial order defined by bond inclusion , the blocks in this partition are boolean . that is , each set has a tree @xmath23 as minimal graph and a corresponding maximal graph @xmath24 , all graphs with edge set @xmath25 such that @xmath26 are included in the set in the partition . this form of a partition lends itself well to performing estimates on the cluster coefficients . this was actually realised earlier by penrose @xcite in the specific case of connected graphs . understanding this partition into boolean subsets also gives rise to an alternative involution . it is intriguing to realise that the general construction does not include the penrose construction as a subcase . these ideas are addressed in section [ sec : extend ] . this combinatorial understanding is also closely linked to the tree - graph identities of brydges battle and federbush @xcite , for which a symmetric version is provided by abdesselam and rivasseau @xcite and a matroid generalisation by faris @xcite . these identities allow estimations to be made on these coefficients , since we may express the sum over connected graphs as a sum over trees with modified weights . a greater goal is to extend these to partially ordered sets where a matroid structure may not be present . interest in providing such bounds on the virial expansion coefficients has recently been renewed with the papers by pulvirenti and tsagkarogiannis @xcite and morais and procacci @xcite , which use the canonical ensemble as a method of achieving bounds . the paper by jansen @xcite suggests that at high temperatures the radius of convergence should be improved : actual improvements on the bounds of lebowitz and penrose @xcite have been proposed recently @xcite . in a classical gas system of @xmath0 indistinguishable interacting particles in a vessel @xmath27 with only two - body interactions and no external potential , we may write the hamiltonian as : h(,)=_i=1^n + _ 1 i < j n(q_i , q_j ) , where @xmath28 represents the generalised coordinates and @xmath29 the conjugate momenta . the canonical partition function of the gas model is : z(,,n)=_i=1^n ( _ ^dq_i _ ^d ^dp_i ) ( - h ) . integrating out the gaussian integrals for the momenta , we obtain a factor @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the thermal wavelength . the partition function is therefore : z ( , , n)= _ i=1^n ( _ ^dq_i ) _ 1 i < j n(-(q_i , q_j ) ) [ eq : canonicalpfinvol ] . the mayer trick @xcite , allows us to rewrite the canonical partition function in terms of weighted graphs . the first stage is to define the mayer @xmath32-function : f(q_i , q_j):=(-(q_i , q_j))-1 .we realise that the product of exponentials in may be rewritten as : _ 1 i < j n ( -(q_i , q_j))=_1 i < j n(1+f(q_i , q_j))=_g [ n]_(i , j ) e(g)f(q_i , q_j ) , where @xmath33 $ ] is the set of simple graphs ( no multiple edges or loops ) on @xmath0 points . we write a graph @xmath34 , where @xmath35^{(2)}$ ] is the edge set and @xmath36 $ ] is the vertex set . this motivates the graph weight : w(g)=_i=1^n ( _ ^dq_i ) _ ( k , l ) e(g)f(q_k , q_l ) . we can therefore write the partition function as : z ( , , n)=_g [ n]w(g ) . in order to obtain the grand canonical partition function we sum : ( , , z)=_n=0^ z^n^n z ( , , n ) , where @xmath37 the activity and @xmath38 is the chemical potential . in terms of graphs , we write this as : ( , , z)=_n=0^_g [ n]w(g ) = : _ the pressure is defined to be : p= _ || ( , , z ) .if we define the new weight @xmath39 , then the pressure function can be written in terms of connected graphs : p = _ w(z)=_n=1^ _ g [ n]w(g ) [ eq : pressureconnectedinv ] .this is the content of mayer s first theorem @xcite and is explained in the paper @xcite . the density @xmath40 is : = z p = ^_w(z ) , where @xmath41 denotes a rooted connected graph . from mayer s second theorem @xcite or by the dissymmetry theorem @xcite , we are able to obtain a series expansion for pressure in terms of density , in which the coefficients are , up to a prefactor , the @xmath42-weighted two - connected graphs . p = - _ n=2^ _ g [ n]w(g ) [ eq : pressure2connectedinv].one may also consult the book by mccoy @xcite for an explanation of the derivation of these two theorems .      the potential for a one - particle hard core gas is : ( q_i , q_j)= , so that @xmath43 and @xmath44 . the grand canonical partition function is : ( z)=1+z . the statistical mechanical relationships give pressure and density as : @xmath45 we may invert , to obtain : z = and substitute for @xmath8 in , to obtain : p = - ( 1- ) . the two series expansions derived from statistical mechanics are : @xmath46 if we compare these two power series with and respectively , using the graph weight @xmath47 , where @xmath3 is the number of edges in graph @xmath4 , we obtain : @xmath48}(-1)^{e(g)}&=(-1)^{n-1}(n-1 ) ! \\ \sum\limits_{g \in \mathcal{b}[n]}(-1)^{e(g)}&=-(n-2 ) ! .\end{aligned}\ ] ] for a continuum hard core gas in one dimension with diameter @xmath49 , the potential is : ( q_i , q_j)=    & |q_i - q_j|<1 + 0 &    . the exponential and mayer @xmath32-functions are : @xmath50 we therefore have the graph weight : w(g)=(-1)^e(g)_^n-1 _ \{i , j } e(g)(|x_i - x_j|<1 ) x_2 x_n , where @xmath14 and @xmath51 is the indicator function .    in @xcite , this is interpreted as a the volume of a convex polytope @xmath52 in @xmath53 . the polytope is defined by : _ g = \ { ( ) _ [ 2,n ] ^n-1 |x_i - x_j|<1 \{i , j } e(g ) x_1=0 } . we use the notation @xmath54=\{2 , 3 , \cdots , n\}$ ] and @xmath15}=(x_2 , \cdots x_n)$ ] . hence the graph weight may be written as : w(g)=(-1)^e(g)(_g ) . the derivation of the cluster and virial expansions , using statistical mechanics , are more difficult in this case , but they are done in @xcite and we achieve : @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the lambert @xmath57-function . if we compare these to the results of mayer s first and second theorems , and , we obtain the combinatorial relationships : @xmath48}(-1)^{e(g)}{\mathop{\mathrm{vol}}}(\pi_g ) & = ( -1)^{n-1}n^{n-1 } \\ \sum\limits_{g \in \mathcal{b}[n]}(-1)^{e(g)}{\mathop{\mathrm{vol}}}(\pi_g ) & = -n(n-2 ) ! .\end{aligned}\ ] ] the results of this article are the combinatorial interpretations of the cancellations in the alternating sums of weighted two - connected graphs . [ thm:1phc ] the difference of two - connected graphs with an even number of edges and an odd number of edges is given by the following formula : _ g [ n](-1)^e(g)=-(n-2)!.    this is proved through an involution @xmath58 , given in section [ sec:1phcinv ] , which effectively pairs graphs differing by only one edge , leaving some small collection of graphs fixed , which give the @xmath59 factor .    the fixed graphs are formed from an increasing tree on the vertex set @xmath60 $ ] with the vertex @xmath0 adjacent to every other vetex . the number of increasing trees on @xmath60 $ ] is @xmath59 . the tree has @xmath61 edges and we add @xmath62 edges from the vertex labelled @xmath0 to achieve @xmath22 edges . this gives the definite minus sign and the combinatorial factor . an increasing tree is a labelled tree on which the sequence of vertex labels along all paths from the vertex labelled @xmath49 to the leaves form increasing sequences . an example of such a graph is shown in figure [ fig : increasingtree ] . [ thm : chcg ] when we add the polytope weights to the alternating graph sum , we achieve the following identity : _ g [ n](-1)^e(g)(_g)=-n(n-2 ) ! . this is proved through a collection of involutions @xmath63 . the index @xmath64 is related to the partition of the polytopes into areas of equal volume attributed to lass in @xcite . the meaning of @xmath64 is explained in subsection [ subsec : lasspolytope ] . the fixed points of these involutions occur only when @xmath64 is of the form @xmath65 , meaning that any edge is possible . there are precisely @xmath0 possibilities of these sequences , which corresponds to the @xmath0 positions of the last zero . the particular @xmath64 provides a bijection @xmath66 \to [ n]$ ] on which the fixed graphs correspond to an increasing tree ( given by the order @xmath67 if and only if @xmath68 ) on the labels @xmath69 . this is paired with every edge from @xmath70 to the vertices @xmath69 . the number of these increasing trees on @xmath62 vertices is @xmath59 and hence we obtain the factor @xmath71 . we notice that these graphs are on @xmath22 edges as above , which provides the minus sign . the two - connected case is necessarily more complicated than the connected case . first of all , minimal two - connected graphs do not all have the same number of edges for a fixed number of vertices as trees ( minimal connected graphs ) do . simply removing edges appropriately down to a minimal graph can not provide a combinatorial understanding as there will still be sign differences to take care of . furthermore , the sign of the factor is constant - the number of edges must always be odd for whatever value of @xmath0 we take . as indicated in the introduction , the proof of theorem [ thm:1phc ] is done through an involution . to explain how the involution @xmath58 provides the combinatorial factor through the number of fixed points , we use the manipulations of bernardi @xcite , where we know that the involution either adds an edge , removes an edge or leaves the graph fixed . we have that : _ g [ n](-1)^e(g)=_g [ n](-1)^e((g ) ) , since @xmath58 is a bijection . the sum of these is therefore : @xmath72}(-1)^{e(g)}&=\sum\limits_{g \in \mathcal{b}[n]}((-1)^{e(g)}+(-1)^{e(\psi(g ) ) } ) \notag \\   & = 2\sum\limits_{g \in \mathcal{b}[n ] \vert \psi(g)=g}(-1)^{e(g ) } . \end{aligned}\ ] ] the fixed points of the involution thus give us the combinatorial factor . this section describes the involution and proves it does what is required .    for graphs , the analogous operation to symmetric difference explained in the introduction is the operation @xmath73 . @xmath74 is the graph @xmath75 . the specific task of the proof of both identities is to identify for each graph a unique edge that we can add or remove . this has to be done in a consistent and efficient manner . consistent in the sense that if we identify @xmath76 as the unique edge in @xmath4 , then we want @xmath77 so that @xmath58 is an involution . it needs to be efficient in the sense that the only graphs it leaves fixed are those that provide the combinatorial factor relevant for the alternating sum . we do not want further cancellations to consider .    in each graph @xmath4 , we consider the vertex labelled @xmath0 . when the vertex @xmath0 is adjacent to every vertex , we realise that the collection of two - connected graphs with this property may be identified with the collection of connected graphs on the vertex set @xmath60 $ ] . bernardi @xcite has already provided an involution on this set that we can use in this case to obtain cancellations , since they will all come with the same prefactor @xmath78 from the @xmath62 edges from the vertex labelled @xmath0 . we thus firstly introduce the involution of bernardi and make rigorous the connection between connected graphs on @xmath60 $ ] and the particular subset of two - connected graphs where @xmath0 is adjacent to every other vertex .    for those graphs where the vertex labelled @xmath0 is not adjacent to every other vetex , we may use the two - connected property of the graph to find an edge suitable for the involution . this is done through using a corollary due to whitney of menger s theorem and introducing a definition of permissible edges . we emphasise how these combine to give a complete involution and that the only contributions arise from the bernardi involution . firstly , we define the neighbourhood of a vertex @xmath79 in a graph @xmath4 .    for a graph @xmath4 and a vertex @xmath79 , we define the neighbourhood of @xmath79 in @xmath4 as @xmath80 . we define the _ lexicographic order _ on edges @xmath81^{(2)}$ ] by : \{i , j } < \{k , l }    \{i , j } < \{k , l } + \{i , j } = \{k , l } \{i , j } < \{k , l }    .    for a subset @xmath82 of a totally ordered set , we define @xmath83 . for a graph @xmath84 and an edge @xmath85 , we define @xmath86 with respect to the lexicographic order above . we give here bernardi s involution on connected graphs , since it used for the two - connected graph version . we write it for the vertex set @xmath60 $ ] as this is the form in which it will be used . an edge @xmath87^{(2)}$ ] is externally active for the graph @xmath88 $ ] , if there is a path in @xmath89 between the endpoints of @xmath85 . if a connected graph @xmath4 has an externally active edge , we define @xmath90 to be the maximal such edge . the involution @xmath91 \to \mathcal{c}[n-1]$ ] defined by bernardi @xcite , is given by : _ b : g    g _ g & g + g &    .    the result of the involution is the following lemma .    under the involution @xmath92 , only increasing trees are kept fixed . we introduce the following notation to simplify the formulation of the connection between two - connected graphs with vertex set @xmath5 $ ] , where the vertex labelled @xmath0 is adjacent to every other vertex , and connected graphs with vertex set @xmath60 $ ] .    * for a graph @xmath84 , we denote by @xmath93 , the graph @xmath94 . * we denote the subset of two - connected graphs on vertex set @xmath5 $ ] with vertex @xmath0 adjacent to all other vertices by @xmath95 $ ] . we define the mapping @xmath96 \to \mathcal{c}[n-1]$ ] , by @xmath97 . we emphasise that removing a vertex and its incident edges from a two - connected graph leaves a connected graph and so defining the codomain of @xmath98 as @xmath99 $ ] is fine . the map @xmath96 \to \mathcal{c}[n-1]$ ] is a bijection . firstly it is injective . if @xmath100 , this means @xmath101^{(2)}=e(h ) \cap [ n-1]^{(2)}$ ] and since @xmath4 and @xmath102 $ ] , the remaining elements of @xmath21 and @xmath103 , namely @xmath104\}$ ] , are the same and so @xmath105 . this is surjective , since for any connected graph on @xmath60 $ ] , if we add the vertex labelled @xmath0 and all edges @xmath106 such that @xmath107 $ ] , the resulting graph is two - connected . if we consider removing any vertex @xmath108 from this new graph we see that every vertex is connected to every other vertex via @xmath0 . if @xmath0 is removed then it is connected by definition and hence it is two - connected . we define the inverse map of @xmath98 to be @xmath38 . a path is an alternating sequence of vertices and edges in a graph @xmath109 , which begins and ends with a vertex . the edges are written in terms of the preceding and following vertices : @xmath110 . two paths @xmath109 and @xmath111 are internally disjoint if the only common vertices or edges are the endpoints @xmath112 and @xmath113 .    for an edge @xmath114 the endpoints are defined as the vertices @xmath79 and @xmath115 . the following result in the case @xmath116 is used to find an edge in each graph where @xmath117 $ ] , by using the fact that we have two internally disjoint paths between @xmath0 and some @xmath118 \setminus n_g(n)$ ] . this is a classical theorem of whitney @xcite based upon menger s theorem . [ thm : whitney ] a graph @xmath4 is @xmath119-connected if and only if every pair of vertices is connected by @xmath119 internally disjoint paths . we introduce the notion of permissible edges as those edges which have both endpoints in the neighbourhood of a vertex @xmath79 and can easily be understood as a chord in the graph @xmath4 , when we neglect any edges in @xmath120 . we will focus on the case when @xmath121 .    given a ( two - connected ) graph @xmath4 and a vertex @xmath122 , such that @xmath123 , we define an edge @xmath81^{(2)}$ ] to be @xmath124-permissible if the following condition holds :    @xmath125 there exists an @xmath126 , such that we have two vertex disjoint paths @xmath127 , intersecting each once in @xmath128 . the intersection vertices are the endpoints of @xmath85 . if a two - connected graph @xmath4 with @xmath36 $ ] has a @xmath129-permissible edge , then we denote the largest such edge in lexicographical ordering by @xmath130 .    for every @xmath131 \setminus \mathcal{b}^{\delta}[n]$ ] , we have a @xmath129-permissible edge .    we know that @xmath132 \setminus n_g(n ) \neq \emptyset$ ] , because we are outside of @xmath95 $ ] . if we choose some @xmath133 , then we know by theorem [ thm : whitney ] we have two internally disjoint paths between the vertices labelled @xmath134 and @xmath0 . both paths must hit @xmath135 at some point . when they first hit @xmath135 , then they could go straight to @xmath0 and so each path need only intersect @xmath135 in one place . this provides us with a permissible edge and so @xmath130 is well defined for every @xmath131 \setminus \mathcal{b}^{\delta}[n]$ ] . we define the involution @xmath136 \to \mathcal{b}[n]$ ] through bernardi s involution @xmath92 and the permissible edge concept . * if @xmath137 $ ] , we consider the graph @xmath138 . this is a connected graph and we may apply bernardi s involution to this subgraph and retain the vertex @xmath0 and its incident edges . + this can be written as @xmath139}:=\mu \circ \psi_b \circ \zeta$ ] . * if @xmath117 $ ] , then we define the involution @xmath140 .    the first point to emphasise is that due to the bijection between @xmath95 $ ] and @xmath99 $ ] , we are able to obtain cancellations for these graphs in the same way as bernardi . we are left with increasing trees on the set @xmath60 $ ] and the vertex @xmath0 adjacent to every other vertex . we still need to prove that @xmath58 is indeed an involution . @xmath58 is an involution and its image is contained within @xmath141 $ ] . the fact this is true for @xmath142}$ ] follows from the proof of bernardi . if an edge is permissible , we note that it is a chord in a cycle within the graph @xmath4 . if we add an edge to a two - connected graph it remains two - connected . we prove below that if we remove a chord from a two - connected graph , then it remains two - connected . we denote the chord we are considering by @xmath143 , the original graph by @xmath4 and the graph @xmath144 by @xmath145 . we prove @xmath145 is two - connected by considering the effect of removing a vertex from @xmath145 . there are two cases :    * @xmath146 and @xmath147 are connected as they are the same graphs as @xmath148 and @xmath149 respectively , which are connected since @xmath4 is two - connected . * if we consider another vertex @xmath119 . we assume for contradiction that the graph @xmath150 is not connected . we know @xmath151 is connected and the only difference is that we have the additional edge @xmath152 . this would then imply that @xmath79 and @xmath115 are in different connected components in @xmath150 . we know that @xmath79 and @xmath115 appear in a cycle in @xmath145 . this means if we remove one vertex then we still have a path between @xmath79 and @xmath115 , hence we obtain a contradiction unless @xmath150 is connected . the collection of permissible edges depends only on edges within @xmath132 \setminus n_g(n)$ ] , between @xmath82 and @xmath135 and edges involving @xmath0 . adding or removing a permissible edge does not change the available edges on which one can make the two internally disjoint paths . hence the collection of permissible edges for @xmath4 and @xmath153 are the same . this means that the largest elements in each set are the same i.e. @xmath154 . therefore it is an involution . hence , @xmath58 is an involution and has only fixed points in the set @xmath95 $ ] . the fixed points are those given by bernardi as increasing trees on the vertex set @xmath60 $ ] with @xmath0 adjacent to all vertices in @xmath60 $ ] . in order to deal with the polytope volume weights , we decompose the polytopes into simplices . this first appeared in @xcite and is used in @xcite to prove the connected graph case . this splitting of polytopes into unimodular simplices is attributed to lass . this subsection explains how this splitting of the polytopes into simplices is used to construct the involution for the continuum case . these ideas are important in reducing the case of the tonks gas to the one particle hard core model . the key idea is to split @xmath53 into @xmath155-simplices of equal volume . we then realise that a polytope either fully contains a simplex , intersects only on the boundary of the simplex or is disjoint from the simplex . the sum is then reorganised so that we may sum over each simplex on the outside and then undertake the alternating sum on the restricted set of graphs whose associated polytopes contain the simplex considered . consider @xmath15 } \in \mathbb{r}^{n-1}$ ] and let @xmath156 be the integer part of @xmath157 and @xmath158 be the fractional part such that @xmath159 . let @xmath160 \to [ 2,n]$ ] be a bijection . we may define the simplex @xmath161 , by the set of @xmath162 with integer part @xmath64 and whose fractional parts satisfy : @xmath163 . this simplex has volume @xmath164 . the condition @xmath165 is equivalent to @xmath166 . we therefore have that @xmath167 if and only if for all @xmath168 , we have that @xmath169 with @xmath170 and @xmath171 .    for any graph @xmath172 $ ] , the value @xmath173 counts the pairs @xmath174 and @xmath175 such that @xmath176 is a subpolytope of @xmath52 . we may rearrange the sums over connected or two - connected graphs of the graph weights by first casting the sum as a sum over the pairs @xmath177 and symmetrising the weight over isomorphic graphs . the symmetrisation procedure can be understood by considering a permutation @xmath178 of @xmath54 $ ] and defining for any vector @xmath179 , @xmath180 . for any graph @xmath4 with labels in @xmath5 $ ] , the graph @xmath181 is the graph , with the same vertex set and satisfies @xmath182 . @xmath167 if and only if @xmath183 for any permutation @xmath178 of @xmath54 $ ] . this equivalence can be elucidated by rewriting @xmath184 and @xmath185 . this allows us to rewrite the latter statement as : @xmath186 . this implies , for the entries in vector @xmath187 , that @xmath188 , @xmath189 . since @xmath190 , we may rewrite this as : @xmath191 @xmath192 . we make the identification that @xmath193 to see that we get precisely the statement that @xmath194 . we let @xmath2 denote either @xmath11 or @xmath12 and then we rewrite : @xmath195 \\ \pi(\mathbf{h } , \sigma ) \subset \pi_g}}(-1)^{e(g ) } & = \sum\limits_{\substack{\mathbf{h } \in \mathbb{z}^{n-1 } \ , g \in \mathcal{h}[n ] \\ \pi(\sigma^{-1}(\mathbf{h}),\text{id } ) \subset \pi_{\sigma(g)}}}(-1)^{e(g ) } \notag \\ & = \sum\limits_{\substack { \mathbf{h } \in \mathbb{z}^{n-1 } \ , g \in \mathcal{h}[n ] \\ \pi(\mathbf{h } , \text{id } ) \subset \pi_g}}(-1)^{e(\sigma^{-1}(g ) ) } \notag \\ & = \sum\limits_{\substack{\mathbf{h } \in \mathbb{z}^{n-1 } \ , g \in \mathcal{h}[n ] \\ \pi(\mathbf{h } , \text{id } ) \subset \pi_g}}(-1)^{e(g ) } \end{aligned}\ ] ] we may therefore , understand the weight as : @xmath196}w(g)&=\sum\limits_{g \in \mathcal{h}[n]}(-1)^{e(g)}{\mathop{\mathrm{vol}}}(\pi_g ) = \frac{1}{(n-1)!}\sum\limits_{\substack { \mathbf{h } \in \mathbb{z}^{n-1 } \sigma \in s_{n-1 } \\ \text{such that } \pi(\mathbf{h},\sigma ) \subset \pi_g}}(-1)^{e(g ) } \notag \\ & = \sum\limits_{\substack{\mathbf{h } \in \mathbb{z}^{n-1 } \ , g \in \mathcal{h}[n ] \\ \pi(\mathbf{h},\text{id } ) \subset \pi_g}}(-1)^{e(g ) } \end{aligned}\ ] ] we define the _ centroid _ of the vector @xmath64 , by @xmath197 , where @xmath198 and @xmath199 . we define @xmath200 as the graph on @xmath5 $ ] where the edges are all pairs @xmath114 such that @xmath201 . we define @xmath202:=\{g \in \mathcal{h}[n ] \vert e(g ) \cap e(k_{\mathbf{h}})=e(g ) \}$ ] where @xmath2 can be replaced by @xmath11 or @xmath203 . the final sum indicates that we need to count pairs @xmath64 and @xmath4 such that @xmath204 . that is that the centroid @xmath205 , since @xmath206 is in the interior of @xmath207 . this can be recast as : for @xmath205 , we require that : \{i , j } e(g )    _ [ n](-1)^e(g ) we can thus consider the total sum as first a sum over the subset of graphs @xmath202 $ ] for each @xmath64 and add the results . this leads to considering separate @xmath208 \to \mathcal{b}_{\mathbf{h}}[n]$ ] which are involutions and finding their fixed points . we define an involution @xmath209 for each @xmath174 on the set @xmath210 $ ] of two connected graphs , which are compatible with the vector @xmath64 . we note that , by the definition of @xmath210 $ ] , edges with @xmath211 are forbidden . we call an edge @xmath212 such that @xmath213 allowed .    in order to make the connection with the proof in the discrete case , we indicate a bijection @xmath214 related to the particular @xmath64 that provides a suitable relabelling of the vertices to allow for an efficient application of the lemmas of section [ sec : chcginv ] to a relabelled graph . we reframe the consequences of these lemmas in the context of the allowed edges . it is important to check that an edge we may want to add or remove by the prescription in section [ sec : chcginv ] is allowed within the specific collection of graphs @xmath210 $ ] . it is then proved that when we have a non empty set of forbidden edges , all terms cancel . in the case when the set of forbidden edges is empty , we obtain the exact values taken by @xmath64 and everything reduces to the discrete gas case with a relabelling . we have a definite order on the entries of @xmath206 , since each entry has a different fractional part . we define a re - ordering of the set @xmath5 $ ] , through a bijection @xmath215 \to [ n]$ ] . this re - ordering is defined through the order for the entries of @xmath206 : @xmath216 . the re - ordered lexicographic order on edges is given by : \{_(i),_(j ) } < \{_(k),_(l ) }    \{i , j } < \{k , l } + \{i , j } = \{k , l } \{i , j } < \{k , l }    .    instead of considering @xmath129-permissible edges , we consider @xmath217-permissible edges since it makes the formulation of the involution easier . [ lem : permisallowed ] all edges @xmath218 are allowed . we realise that @xmath219 we have that @xmath220 and so for every pair @xmath221 , @xmath213 and hence the edge is allowed in @xmath210 $ ] . all @xmath217-permissible edges are allowed . if @xmath222)$ ] , then @xmath210=\mathcal{b}[n]$ ] and @xmath64 is of the form of an initial sequence of zeroes with remaining entries @xmath223 .    by lemma [ lem : permisallowed ] , all edges in @xmath224)^{(2)}$ ] are allowed . the edges @xmath225 for all @xmath226)$ ] are already in the graph and so can not be forbidden . hence every edge is allowed and so @xmath210=\mathcal{b}[n]$ ] .    since @xmath199 , this means @xmath227 for all @xmath79 . we also note that if @xmath228 , then @xmath229 for all @xmath230 . this arises from the fact that the entries of @xmath64 are restricted to @xmath231 . for a negative entry we will have @xmath232 , which is not within distance @xmath49 of the value @xmath233 for any @xmath230 this means that @xmath64 is of the special form of an initial sequence of zeroes with the remaining entries @xmath223 . we define the set @xmath234 $ ] as the collection of two - connected graphs where @xmath235 is adjacent to all other vertices . we have the corresponding maps @xmath236 and @xmath237 between @xmath234 $ ] and @xmath238 \setminus \{\xi_{\mathbf{h}}(n)\}]$ ] , which are the same as in section [ sec : chcginv ] , except we are removing the vertex @xmath235 instead of @xmath0 . formally , we can write these bijections as a conjugation with @xmath214 , when interpreted as its action on graphs . in this case : @xmath239    we define the modified bernardi involution @xmath240 as in section [ sec : chcginv ] , except @xmath89 is interpreted in the sense of the re - ordered lexicographic ordering and for @xmath90 to be maximal externally active edge we use this ordering too . this can also be simply written using the graphical label conjugation : _ b , : = _ _ b _ ^-1    the largest ( using the re - ordered lexicographic order ) @xmath241-permissible edge is denoted by @xmath242 . we define @xmath209 as the involution on @xmath210 $ ] , defined by :    * if @xmath222)$ ] , then we may use a modified version of bernardi , since all edges are possible in @xmath243 . ^_[n ] : = _ _ b , _ * otherwise , we have a permissible edge and can perform the involution @xmath244 . @xmath209 retains the property of being an involution on two - connected graphs as in section [ sec : chcginv ] . we are thus left with only those graphs that have @xmath222)$ ] and are increasing with respect to the re - ordered lexicographic order . the only @xmath64 vectors that contribute are those with an initial sequence of zeros followed by @xmath223s . there are @xmath0 possibilities of these sequences , since the final @xmath245 can appear in any of the entries @xmath246 . the permutation @xmath214 related to the @xmath64-vector with @xmath247 for @xmath248 and @xmath249 for @xmath250 takes the special form : _ : s n.    we observe that the entry @xmath251 has the smallest value so @xmath252 . we then note that the following entries are negative and are in increasing order . the preceding entries are also in increasing order but are positive . hence we have @xmath253 for @xmath254 and @xmath255 for @xmath256 , which can be written in the form in the lemma for brevity . hence we have a precise collection of two - connected graphs . we have the examples from section [ sec : chcginv ] with these linear relabellings .    for @xmath257 , the fixed graphs are all distinct . we indicate that there are no labelled graph automorphisms of the form of @xmath214 described above for the increasing trees on @xmath60 $ ] with @xmath0 adjacent to every vertex . the first observation is that @xmath214 has no fixed vertex labels . we know the degree of the vertex labelled @xmath0 is @xmath62 . if we were to have an automorphism with no fixed labels , then we require another vertex of the same degree to send @xmath0 to . this means we need a vertex in the increasing tree adjacent to all other vertices in the increasing tree . when a tree has at least three vertices , only one vertex can be adjacent to the rest , since if we have two vertices adjacent to all vertices we have them adjacent to each other and some third vertex . this creates a @xmath258-cycle contradicting the fact a tree is acyclic . furthermore , in this increasing tree , this vertex can only be the vertex labelled @xmath49 or @xmath259 . for any @xmath260 $ ] , @xmath119 can not be attached to both @xmath49 and @xmath259 , or else we will have a @xmath258-cycle , as we always have the edge @xmath261 . we therefore require that the graph automorphism exchanges the labels of the two vertices . the automorphisms are translations and since @xmath262 or @xmath263 , we have to translate by @xmath49 or @xmath259 , but then the vertex labelled @xmath49 or @xmath259 would not be relabelled as @xmath0 as we would require . hence @xmath214 is not an automorphism for any of the prescribed graphs and so the collection of these graphs for @xmath257 are all distinct . in this section , we indicate how the structure of two - connected graphs indicates the importance of graphs with @xmath22 edges . firstly , we explain some preliminary concepts about block cutpoint trees and then use these to explain why minimal two - connected graphs , that is a two - connected graph , such that the removal of an edge renders the graph no longer two - connected , on @xmath0 vertices have at most @xmath264 edges .      in this section , we introduce the notion of a block cut - point tree and state a result relating the number of vertices in the individual blocks to the number of vertices in the whole graph . we use the notation @xmath265 to denote the collection of trees .    * an _ articulation point _ in a connected graph is a vertex , which when it and its incident edges are removed , renders the graph disconnected . a synonym that is frequently used is a _ cutpoint_. * a _ two - connected graph _ is a connected graph without articulation points . * a _ block _ is a maximal two - connected subgraph of a connected graph . maximal in terms of edges and vertices it includes . the block cutpoint tree ( bc - tree ) associated to a connected graph @xmath4 is a ( bipartite ) graph where the vertices represent the articulation points and the blocks in a connected graph . an edge , between an articulation point and a block , is present in this graph , when an articulation point is contained in a block . it is a tree , since if there were a cycle in this graph then the cycle itself would have been a block . an example of a block cutpoint tree is shown in figure [ fig : bctreethesis ] .    to define the centre of a tree formally , we define first the _ eccentricity _ @xmath266 of a vertex @xmath267 as the minimal graph distance of @xmath267 to a leaf . this may be formally written as @xmath268 , where @xmath269 indicates the hamming or graph distance in the tree . the centre of a tree is the collection of vertices at which the maximum eccentricity is attained . this can either be two neighbouring vertices or a single vertex . in the former case , we often call the edge between the vertices the centre of the tree . one can apply the function @xmath270 , which for any given tree , removes all leaves and the edges incident to the leaves . formally , we can write this as : f:(v(),e ( ) ) ( v ( ) l , e ( ) ( l v ( ) ) ) , where @xmath271 , the collection of leaves . repeated application of @xmath32 , gives a sequence of trees , @xmath272 which becomes constant either when we have a single vertex or the empty graph . in the case of the single vertex , this is the centre of the tree . for the empty graph , the penultimate step will have been two vertices and an edge . this edge or the pair of vertices is defined as the centre . a bc - tree is bipartite with all leaves in one set ( the blocks ) . it therefore has a unique centre , since the eccentricity of the articulation points will be odd and the eccentricity of the blocks will be even so two neighbours can not have the same maximum eccentricity . since we have a unique vertex at the centre of the bc - tree , we may define a digraph arising from the bc - tree , where the edge is oriented to point away from the centre . an example is displayed in figure [ fig : digraph ] . [ lem : blockdecomp ] if we decompose a connected graph on @xmath0 vertices into its block structure and let @xmath273 index the collection of blocks and @xmath274 be the sequence of block sizes , then we have the following equality : _ i i(k_i-1)=n-1 [ eq : bctreeidentity ] . the key idea is to indicate what vertex we omit inside each block on the left hand side of . the digraph gives an ( essentially ) unique prescription of the missing vertex in each block and in which block an articulation point is counted . the digraph comprises of two types of directed edge @xmath275 and @xmath276 , where @xmath134 indicates an articulation point and @xmath277 a block . the arrow points from the first entry to the second entry . since there is a unique path from the centre to every other vertex , every vertex has precisely one edge in which they are the second entry . there are two key cases :    * * the centre is an articulation point * + for a block , @xmath277 , the unique vertex we neglect on the left hand side of is the articulation point , @xmath134 , where @xmath276 is the directed edge in the digraph . + every articulation point , @xmath278 , except the centre appears in an edge @xmath279 , for which it is the second entry , meaning it is enumerated in the left hand side of in precisely one block . the central articulation point is the only neglected vertex , which gives the right hand side of . * * the centre is a block * + in this case every block , except the centre , can be given the prescription as for the first case . for the central block , we can choose precisely one of its neighbours to neglect . all articulation points in this case have an edge in which they are the second entry and so are counted , excepting the articulation point identified by the central block . therefore , we have .      to understand why the two - connected graphs on @xmath0 vertices with @xmath22 edges play a special role , we first indicate that two - connected graphs with at least this number of edges can not be minimal .    given a graph @xmath4 on the vertex set @xmath5 $ ] , we denote by @xmath280 , the degree of the vertex labelled @xmath49 . two - connected graphs on @xmath0 vertices with @xmath281 edges are not minimal , that is they necessarily have a chord . this is done by induction on the number of vertices @xmath0 . the cases @xmath282 are vacuous and one can see from the examples in figure [ fig:5edges4vertices ] that this holds when @xmath283 . the connected graph @xmath284 may be decomposed into its bc - tree . each block with @xmath285 vertices in the tree has to have @xmath286 edges or else we have a smaller graph which has a chord by induction . we note here that blocks of size @xmath259 or @xmath258 need to be treated separately . we let @xmath287 denote the size of the @xmath79th block not of size @xmath259 or @xmath258 and @xmath288 and @xmath289 denote the number of blocks of size @xmath259 and @xmath258 respectively . we have from lemma [ lem : blockdecomp ] : _ i(l_i-1)+b_2 + 2b_3=n-2 the total number of edges in @xmath290 must then not exceed : _ i2(l_i-1)-2b_4+b_2 + 3b_3 2n-4 - b_2-b_3 - 2b_4 where @xmath291 indicates the number of blocks with more than four vertices . we know that @xmath292 and so we obtain the inequality : d_1 1+b_2+b_3 + 2b_4 1 +    if we have only one block , then we either have two neighbours of @xmath49 and can apply induction to this block , as it will be a two - connected graph on @xmath62 vertices and at least @xmath293 edges . if we have at least three neighbours of @xmath49 in a block , say @xmath278 , @xmath294 and @xmath295 , then we may find a path @xmath296 . this follows from theorem [ thm : whitney ] , since we have two internally disjoint paths between @xmath278 and @xmath294 and between @xmath294 and @xmath295 . if we go along one of the paths between @xmath278 and @xmath294 until we first hit one of the two paths between @xmath294 and @xmath295 , from here we follow the path towards @xmath294 and then take the disjoint path to @xmath295 , this is then a path between @xmath278 and @xmath295 that goes via @xmath294 and does not self - intersect . in this case @xmath297 forms a chord . the final case is if we have at least two blocks and at most two neighbours of @xmath49 in a block . then we have a block with two neighbours of @xmath49 call them @xmath278 and @xmath294 and we have a third neighbour of @xmath49 , @xmath295 in some other block . let @xmath298 be the articulation point of the block containing @xmath278 and @xmath294 closest to @xmath295 . we have a path from @xmath298 to @xmath295 outside of this block since it is a connected graph . we are also able to construct a path @xmath299 since they are all in one block . concatenating these paths gives again a path @xmath296 from which we determine @xmath297 is a chord . it is also possible to construct a graph with @xmath0 vertices and @xmath264 edges that is minimally two - connected , as shown in figure [ fig : minimally2conn ] . the number of edges being @xmath22 marks some transition in the possibility of being minimal . edges and @xmath0 vertices which is minimally two - connected ]     edges and @xmath0 vertices which is minimally two - connected ] in this section , we convey the connection between involutions and partition schemes for connected graphs and how the latter is used to give estimations of the coefficients in the expansions . this is used as motivation to consider whether the two - connected graph involution may have such a connection . the paper @xcite presents the notion of the partition in the sense of penrose and gives the general idea of a partition . we define a partial order of @xmath300 $ ] by bond inclusion : @xmath301 @xmath302 @xmath303 . for @xmath304 , we define the set @xmath305=\{k\vert \ , g \leq k \leq h\}$ ] the penrose construction partitions the set of connected graphs into subsets of the form @xmath306 $ ] , where @xmath307 \to \mathcal{c}[n]$ ] . many different constructions can be used to achieve an @xmath308 . penrose gave one explicit example in @xcite . a partition scheme for the set of connected graphs @xmath300 $ ] is any map @xmath309 \to \mathcal{c}[n]$ ] @xmath310 , such that :    * @xmath311 and * @xmath300 $ ] is the disjoint union of the sets @xmath312 $ ] for @xmath313 $ ] . the penrose scheme is as follows :    for any vertex @xmath79 of @xmath313 $ ] , we denote by @xmath314 the tree distance between the vertices @xmath79 and @xmath49 . we let @xmath315 be the predecessor of @xmath79 i.e. @xmath316 and @xmath317 . we associate to @xmath23 , the graph @xmath318 found by adding ( only once ) to @xmath23 all edges @xmath319^{(2)}$ ] such that either :    * @xmath320 edges between vertices at same generation * @xmath321 and @xmath322 edges between vertices one generation away    for a partition scheme @xmath308 , denote by @xmath323 \vert \ , r(\tau)=\tau \}$ ] the set of @xmath308-trees . in particular , @xmath324 is the set of penrose trees . the following proposition emphasises where the boolean partition offers advantages to providing estimations .    in models where we have soft repulsion ( a positive potential ) , the mayer @xmath32-function satisfies @xmath325 . using a partition scheme , we have the bound : _ g [ n]_e e(g)f_e _ e e()|f_e|     for any numbers @xmath326^{(2)}}$ ] , we have : @xmath48 } \prod\limits_{e \in e(g ) } f_e & = \sum\limits_{\tau \in \mathfrak{a}[n ] } \prod\limits_{e \in e(\tau)}f_e \sum\limits_{f \subset e(r(\tau ) ) \setminus e(\tau ) } \prod\limits_{e \in f } f_e \notag \\ & = \sum\limits_{\tau \in \mathfrak{a}[n]}\prod\limits_{e \in e(\tau)}f_e \prod\limits_{e \in e(r(\tau))\setminus e(\tau)}(1+f_e ) \label{eq : penroserewrite } \end{aligned}\ ] ] when we take the absolute value of the right hand side , we may use the triangle inequality and bound the second product in by @xmath49 .    in the hardcore case , the second product in is zero unless @xmath327 , giving that the fixed points of this @xmath308 function also give a combinatorial interpretation of the cancellations.the alternative combinatorial interpretation of fixed points provided by penrose trees is that , considering the tree as being rooted at @xmath49 , we are required to have precisely one vertex in each generation . this necessarily gives a linear tree . we have to determine the positions of @xmath328 $ ] , which are defined uniquely by their distance from @xmath49 , which corresponds to a bijection , @xmath329 \to [ n-1]$ ] , giving the @xmath330 factor .    to define the penrose involution arising from the penrose construction , we make the following definition of a penrose active edge .    for a graph @xmath4 , we define the hamming distance between vertices labelled @xmath79 and @xmath115 as @xmath331 which is the length of the shortest path between @xmath79 and @xmath115 . an edge @xmath114 is called _ penrose active _ for @xmath4 if , either :    * @xmath332 or * @xmath333 and @xmath334 such that @xmath335 with @xmath336 . we let @xmath337 be the greatest penrose active edge for @xmath4 in lexicographic order . the mapping : _ : g    g e_,g^ & g + g &    is an involution on connected graphs .    we first prove that @xmath338 . the two graphs @xmath4 and @xmath339 differ only on an edge @xmath340 , where @xmath341 . throughout this proof in the case where we have equality , we assume without loss of generality that @xmath342 .    for any @xmath119 , we consider the distance from the vertex labelled @xmath119 to @xmath49 in both graphs . this is defined through the shortest path from @xmath49 to @xmath119 . we indicate that for any path between @xmath49 and @xmath119 containing the edge @xmath114 we can find a path of the same or shorter length that does not contain this edge . if @xmath343 , then considering a path from @xmath49 to @xmath119 up to this edge , we realise that the shortest length the path up to this edge can be is @xmath344 , but we know that there is a shorter path to this endpoint because @xmath343 and so we can replace this initial path with a shorter path . we are left with the case @xmath345 . we know from property @xmath346 that there is some @xmath315 such that @xmath336 and @xmath347 is an edge in both graphs . therefore if the initial segment of a path includes the edge @xmath114 , then the shortest this can be is @xmath348 . if the initial segment ends at @xmath115 rather than @xmath79 then we know we have a shorter path to @xmath115 that we can replace this initial segment by . otherwise it ends at @xmath79 . we know that we have a path of length @xmath349 to @xmath315 on which we can attach the edge @xmath350 to construct a new path of the same length but not using this edge . we now have that condition @xmath351 for penrose active edges is the same in both graphs , since the graph distance is the same . we now indicate that an edge satisfies condition @xmath346 independent of the presence of @xmath114 . we realise if @xmath114 was added or removed satisfying @xmath351 then it has no effect on an edge satisfying @xmath346 , since @xmath346 depends on edges between generations . therefore , we consider that @xmath114 satisfies @xmath346 . since @xmath333 , we have an @xmath322 such that @xmath347 is an edge in both graphs and @xmath336 . this means that if we use @xmath115 to invoke applying condition @xmath346 for an edge to be penrose active , then we can invoke it in both cases by using @xmath315 . we can also go the other way and find a bernardi construction to provide an appropriate partition . the map @xmath309 \to \mathcal{c}[n]$ ] , which adds to @xmath23 all externally active edges for the given tree graph @xmath23 is the appropriate partition scheme . this is explained in the context of matroids below .    in the work of bjrner and sokal @xcite , it is explained that for a matroid @xmath352 , where we give a total order to the underlying set @xmath353 , we may find a partition of the collection of subsets of @xmath354 according to the matroid structure . we introduce below some key definitions for matroids to introduce this connection , which can be found in the book of oxley @xcite and the work of faris @xcite . a matroid @xmath352 on the ground set @xmath355 is defined by a collection of independent subsets , denoted @xmath356 . these subsets must satisfy the following three axioms :    1 . @xmath357 ( non empty ) 2 . if @xmath358 and @xmath359 then @xmath360 ( downward closed ) 3 . if @xmath358 and @xmath361 and @xmath362 , then there exists @xmath363 with @xmath364 ( augmentation property )    for a graphical matroid , the ground set is @xmath5^{(2)}$ ] . we define the independent sets as forests or acyclic graphs . a maximal independent set @xmath365 is called a basis . the set of bases is denoted @xmath366 . the maximal independent sets for a graphical matroid are therefore trees .    the rank of a matroid @xmath352 , @xmath367 is the cardinality of a basis element . all bases have the same cardinality and so the rank is well defined . a matroid can be defined by its set of bases , since @xmath368 if and only if @xmath369 , for some @xmath370 .    given a matroid , @xmath352 , consider @xmath371 . there is a matroid @xmath372 , which is the restriction of @xmath352 to @xmath18 . it has ground set @xmath18 and @xmath373 .    for @xmath371 , the rank of @xmath18 , @xmath374 is the rank of the matroid @xmath372 or alternatively the cardinality of the largest independent subset of @xmath18 . we note that @xmath375 if and only if @xmath18 is independent , so the rank function completely determines the matroid . the dual of a matroid is defined on the same ground set , but has a dual rank function rk@xmath376 , defined by : ^(a):=|a|-(e)+(e a )    let @xmath12 be the set of bases for @xmath25 . the dual basis

of @xmath277 larger than it . we let @xmath380 be the set of externally active elements . an element @xmath381 is _ internally active _ on @xmath277 , if in the dual matroid @xmath85 is externally active on the complement @xmath382 . we denote by @xmath383 the set of internally active elements .    for @xmath384 , we define @xmath385=\{a \vert r \subseteq a \subseteq s\}$ ] . @xmath386 can be written as the disjoint union : 2^e=_b [ b(b),b ( b ) ] [ eq : c1 ] . for the case of the graphical matroid , we recall that the bases are the collection of trees . if we use the lexicographical order on the edges , then an edge is externally active for a tree @xmath23 in this sense , if and only if it is externally active in the sense of bernardi @xcite . this is due to the fact that all independent sets are forests and so a set of edges is dependent if it creates a cycle . we emphasise that for connected graphs , internally active edges play no role , since trees are minimally connected graphs . this therefore gives , when we intersect each set with connected graphs :    [ n]=_[n ] [ , r ( ) ] , where @xmath24 has edge set @xmath387 . we note that the penrose construction does not fit in the construction given above . in figure [ fig : penrosenoorder ] , we see that we would add the dashed edge in each case . in order to do this , we can not have a consistent ordering on the edges @xmath388 , @xmath389 and @xmath390 . the motivation of emphasising this connection is to understand if a similar connection may be drawn for two - connected graphs as the important context of the result . the main conclusion is that we are able to identify combinatorially the cancellations in the alternating sums of weighted two - connected graphs . the combinatorial factor arises from increasing trees on the subset @xmath60 $ ] of the vertices , with the vertex @xmath0 adjacent to every other vertex . there are modified versions for this in the case of the polytope , where we have the isomorphic graph structures , differing only through a relabelling in the form @xmath391 for all @xmath392 $ ] . the key outlook for the work contained in this paper is to modify the set up explained in section [ sec : extend ] towards two - connected graphs so that we obtain a helpful resummation of the graphs amenable to suitable estimation , which is important for the virial expansion . the parallel that is useful to draw here is that for the cluster expansion , we have the increasing and cayley trees as the combinatorial objects representing the two cases above . it has been shown by groeneveld @xcite that these examples provide the extreme cases for positive potentials and an adaptation is available for stable potentials . * acknowledgements . * the author would

"whereas classical statistical inference is performed in a centralized manner , many modern scientific problems and engineering systems are inherently _ decentralized _ : data are distributed , and can not be aggregated due to various forms of communication constraints . an important example of such a decentralized system is a sensor network  @xcite : a set of spatially - distributed sensors collect data about the environmental state ( e.g. , temperature , humidity or light ) . typically , these networks are based on ad hoc deployments , in which the individual sensors are low - cost , and must operate under very severe power constraints ( e.g. , limited battery life ) . in statistical terms , such communication constraints imply that the individual sensors can not transmit the raw data ; rather , they must compress or quantize the data  for instance , by reducing a continuous - valued observation to a single bit  and can transmit only this compressed representation back to the fusion center .    by now , there is a rich literature in both information theory and statistical signal processing on problems of decentralized statistical inference . a number of researchers , dating back to the seminal paper of tenney and sandell  @xcite , have studied the problem of hypothesis testing under communication - constraints ; see the survey papers  @xcite and references therein for overviews of this line of work . the hypothesis - testing problem has also been studied in the information theory community , where the analysis is asymptotic and shannon - theoretic in nature  @xcite . a parallel line of work deals with problem of decentralized estimation . work in signal processing typically formulates it as a quantizer design problem and considers finite sample behavior  @xcite ; in contrast , the information - theoretic approach is asymptotic in nature , based on rate - distortion theory  @xcite . in much of the literature on decentralized statistical inference , it is assumed that the underlying distributions are known with a specified parametric form ( e.g. , gaussian ) . more recent work has addressed non - parametric and data - driven formulations of these problems , in which the decision - maker is simply provided samples from the unknown distribution  @xcite . for instance , nguyen et al . @xcite established statistical consistency for non - parametric approaches to decentralized hypothesis testing based on reproducing kernel hilbert spaces . luo  @xcite analyzed a non - parametric formulation of decentralized mean estimation , in which a fixed but unknown parameter is corrupted by noise with bounded support but otherwise arbitrary distribution , and shown that decentralized approaches can achieve error rates that are order - optimal with respect to the centralized optimum . this paper addresses a different problem in decentralized non - parametric inference  namely , that of estimating an arbitrary quantile of an unknown distribution . since there exists no unbiased estimator based on a single sample , we consider the performance of a network of @xmath0 sensors , each of which collects a total of @xmath9 observations in a sequential manner . our analysis treats the standard fusion - based architecture , in which each of the @xmath0 sensors transmits information to the fusion center via a communication - constrained channel . more concretely , at each observation round , each sensor is allowed to transmit a single bit to the fusion center , which in turn is permitted to send some number @xmath1 bits of feedback . for a decentralized protocol with @xmath10 bits of feedback , we prove that the algorithm achieves the order - optimal rate of the best centralized method ( i.e. , one with access to the full collection of raw data ) . we also consider a protocol that permits only a single bit of feedback , and establish that it achieves the same rate . this single - bit protocol is advantageous in that , with for a fixed target mean - squared error of the quantile estimate , it yields longer sensor lifetimes than either the centralized or full feedback protocols .    the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . we begin in section  [ secdecent ] with background on quantile estimation , and optimal rates in the centralized setting . we then describe two algorithms for solving the corresponding decentralized version , based on @xmath11 and @xmath12 bit of feedback respectively , and provide an asymptotic characterization of their performance . these theoretical results are complemented with empirical simulations . section  [ sectheory ] contains the analysis of these two algorithms . in section  [ secext ] , we consider various extensions , including the case of feedback bits @xmath13 varying between the two extremes , and the effect of noise on the feedforward link . we conclude in section  [ secdiscussion ] with a discussion . in this section , we begin with some background material on ( centralized ) quantile estimation , before introducing our decentralized algorithms , and stating our main theoretical results . we begin with classical background on the problem of quantile estimation ( see serfling  @xcite for further details ) . given a real - valued random variable @xmath14 , let be its cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) , which is non - decreasing and right - continuous . for any @xmath15 , the @xmath16-quantile of @xmath14 is defined as @xmath17 . moreover , if @xmath18 is continuous at @xmath19 , then we have @xmath20 . as a particular example , for @xmath21 , the associated quantile is simply the median . now suppose that for a fixed level @xmath22 , we wish to estimate the quantile @xmath23 . rather than impose a particular parameterized form on @xmath18 , we work in a non - parametric setting , in which we assume only that the distribution function @xmath18 is differentiable , so that @xmath14 has the density function @xmath24 ( w.r.t lebesgue measure ) , and moreover that @xmath25 for all @xmath26 . in this setting , a standard estimator for @xmath27 is the _ sample quantile _ @xmath28 where @xmath29 denotes the empirical distribution function based on i.i.d . samples @xmath30 . under the conditions given above , it can be shown  @xcite that @xmath31 is strongly consistent for @xmath27 ( i.e. , @xmath32 ) , and moreover that asymptotic normality holds @xmath33 so that the asymptotic mse decreases as @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the total number of samples . although this @xmath36 rate is optimal , the precise form of the asymptotic variance   need not be in general ; see zielinski  @xcite for in - depth discussion of the optimal asymptotic variances that can be obtained with variants of this basic estimator under different conditions . we consider the standard network architecture illustrated in figure  [ fignetwork ] . there are @xmath0 sensors , each of which has a dedicated two - way link to a fusion center . we assume that each sensor @xmath37 collects independent samples @xmath38 of the random variable @xmath39 with distribution function we consider a sequential version of the quantile estimation problem , in which sensor @xmath40 receives measurements @xmath41 at time steps @xmath42 , and the fusion center forms an estimate @xmath43 of the quantile . the key condition  giving rise to the decentralized nature of the problem  is that communication between each sensor and the central processor is constrained , so that the sensor can not simply relay its measurement @xmath38 to the central location , but rather must perform local computation , and then transmit a summary statistic to the fusion center . more concretely , we impose the following restrictions on the protocol . first , at each time step @xmath44 , each sensor @xmath45 can transmit a single bit @xmath46 to the fusion center . second , the fusion center can broadcast @xmath47 bits back to the sensor nodes at each time step . we analyze two distinct protocols , depending on whether or     sensors . each sensor is permitted to transmit a @xmath12-bit message to the fusion center ; in turn , the fusion center is permitted to broadcast @xmath1 bits of feedback.,title=""fig : "" ]      for each protocol , all sensors are initialized with some fixed @xmath48 . the algorithms are specified in terms of a constant @xmath49 and step sizes @xmath50 that satisfy the conditions @xmath51 the first condition ensures infinite travel ( i.e. , that the sequence @xmath52 can reach @xmath27 from any starting condition ) , whereas the second condition ( which implies that @xmath53 ) is required for variance reduction . a standard choice satisfying these conditions  and the one that we assume herein  is @xmath54 . with this set - up , the @xmath11-bit scheme consists of the steps given in table  [ tabmbf ] . although the most straightforward feedback protocol is to broadcast back the @xmath55 received bits @xmath56 , as described in step ( c ) , in fact it suffices to transmit only the @xmath57 bits required to perfectly describe the binomial random variable @xmath58 in order to update @xmath43 . in either case , after the feedback step , each sensor knows the value of the sum @xmath59 , which ( in conjunction with knowledge of @xmath55 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 ) allow it to compute the updated parameter @xmath62 . finally , knowledge of @xmath62 allows each sensor to then compute the local decision   in the following round . the 1-bit feedback scheme detailed in table  [ tab1bf ] is similar , except that it requires broadcasting only a single bit ( @xmath63 ) , and involves an extra step size parameter @xmath64 , which is specified in the statement of theorem  [ thm1bf ] . after the feedback step of the 1-bf algorithm , each sensor has knowledge of the aggregate decision @xmath63 , which ( in conjunction with @xmath61 and the constant @xmath65 ) allow it to compute the updated parameter @xmath62 . knowledge of this parameter suffices to compute the local decision  . we now state our main results on the convergence behavior of these two distributed protocols . in all cases , we assume the step size choice @xmath66 . given fixed @xmath22 , we use @xmath27 to denote the @xmath60-level quantile ( i.e. , such that @xmath67 ) ; note that our assumption of a strictly positive density guarantees that @xmath27 is unique . [ thmmbf ] for any @xmath22 , consider a random sequence @xmath68 generated by the @xmath55-bit feedback protocol . then    \(a ) for all initial conditions @xmath48 , the sequence @xmath43 converges almost surely to the @xmath60-quantile @xmath27 . \(b ) moreover , if the constant @xmath69 is chosen to satisfy @xmath70 , then @xmath71 } \ ; \frac{1}{{\ensuremath{m}}}\right),\ ] ] so that the asymptotic mse is @xmath72 . _ remarks : _ after @xmath2 steps of this decentralized protocol , a total of @xmath73 observations have been made , so that our discussion in section  [ secbackground ] dictates ( see equation  ) that the optimal asymptotic mse is @xmath74 . interestingly , then , the @xmath57-bit feedback decentralized protocol is order - optimal with respect to the centralized gold standard .    before stating the analogous result for the 1-bit feedback protocol , we begin by introducing some useful notation . first , we define for any fixed @xmath75 the random variable @xmath76 note that for each fixed @xmath77 , the distribution of @xmath78 is binomial with parameters @xmath55 and @xmath79 . it is convenient to define the function @xmath80 with domain @xmath81 \times [ 0,1]$ ] . with this notation , we have @xmath82 again , we fix an arbitrary @xmath22 and let @xmath27 be the associated @xmath60-quantile satisfying    [ thm1bf ] given a random sequence @xmath68 generated by the @xmath12-bit feedback protocol , we have    1 .   for any initial condition , the sequence @xmath83 . 2 .   suppose that the step size @xmath84 is chosen such that or equivalently such that @xmath85 then @xmath86}{2 \gamma_{{\ensuremath{m}}}({\ensuremath{\theta^ * } } ) - 1 } \right)\ ] ] 3 . if we choose a _ constant step size _ @xmath87 , then as the asymptotic variance behaves as @xmath88,\ ] ] so that the asymptotic mse is @xmath89 . 4 .   if we choose a _ decaying step size _ @xmath90 , then @xmath91,\ ] ] so that the asymptotic mse is @xmath92 . it is interesting to compare the performance of each proposed decentralized algorithm to the centralized performance . considering first the @xmath57-bf scheme , suppose that we set @xmath93 . using the formula   from theorem  [ thmmbf ] , we obtain that the asymptotic variance of the @xmath55-bf scheme with this choice of @xmath94 is given by @xmath95 , thus matching the asymptotics of the centralized quantile estimator  . in fact , it can be shown that the choice @xmath96 is optimal in the sense of minimizing the asymptotic variance for our scheme , when @xmath94 is constrained by the stability criterion in theorem  [ thmmbf ] . in practice , however , the value @xmath97 is typically not known , so that it may not be possible to implement exactly this scheme . an interesting question is whether an adaptive scheme could be used to estimate @xmath97 ( and hence the optimal @xmath94 simultaneously ) , thereby achieving this optimal asymptotic variance . we leave this question open as an interesting direction for future work . turning now to the algorithm @xmath12-bf , if we make the substitution @xmath98 in equation  , then we obtain the asymptotic variance @xmath99 } \ ; \frac{1}{{\ensuremath{m}}}.\ ] ] since the stability criterion is the same as that for @xmath6-bf , the optimal choice is @xmath100 . consequently , while the @xmath101)$ ] rate is the same as both the centralized and decentralized @xmath55-bf protocols , the pre - factor for the @xmath12-bf algorithm is @xmath102 times larger than the optimized @xmath55-bf scheme . however , despite this loss in the pre - factor , the @xmath12-bf protocol has substantial advantages over the @xmath55-bf ; in particular , the network lifetime scales as @xmath103 compared to @xmath104 for the @xmath57-bf scheme . we now provide some simulation results in order to illustrate the two decentralized protocols , and the agreement between theory and practice .    [ cols=""^,^,^ "" , ]      we now briefly consider the effect of communication noise on our algorithms . there are two types of noise to consider : ( a ) _ feedforward _ , meaning noise in the link from sensor node to fusion center , and ( b ) _ feedback _ , meaning noise in the feedback link from fusion center to the sensor nodes . here we show that feedforward noise can be handled in a relatively straightforward way in our algorithmic framework . on the other hand , feedback noise requires a different analysis , as the different sensors may loose synchronicity in their updating procedure . although a thorough analysis of such asynchronicity is an interesting topic for future research , we note that assuming noiseless feedback is not unreasonable , since the fusion center typically has greater transmission power . focusing then on the case of feedforward noise , let us assume that the link between each sensor and the fusion center acts as a binary symmetric channel ( bsc ) with probability @xmath105 . more precisely , if a bit @xmath106 is transmitted , then the received bit @xmath107 has the ( conditional ) distribution @xmath108 with this bit - flipping noise , the updates ( both equation   and  ) need to be modified so as to correct for the bias introduced by the channel noise . if @xmath60 denotes the desired quantile , then in the presence of bsc(@xmath109 noise , both algorithms should be run with the modified parameter @xmath110 note that @xmath111 ranges between @xmath60 ( for the noiseless case @xmath112 ) , to a quantity arbitrarily close to @xmath113 , as the channel approaches the extreme of pure noise ( @xmath114 ) . the following lemma shows that for all @xmath115 , this adjustment   suffices to correct the algorithm . moreover , it specifies how the resulting asymptotic variance depends on the noise parameter :    [ propnoise ] suppose that each of the @xmath55 feedforward links from sensor to fusion center are modeled as i.i.d . bsc channels with probability @xmath116 . then the @xmath55-bf or @xmath12-bf algorithms , with the adjusted @xmath111 , are strongly consistent in computing the @xmath60-quantile . moreover , with appropriate step size choices , their asymptotic mses scale as @xmath117 with respective pre - factors given by    [ eqndefnvnoise ] @xmath118 } \\ \label{eqndefnvnoise1 } v_1({\ensuremath{\epsilon } } ) & { \ensuremath { : \ , = } } & \left [ \frac{{\ensuremath{k}}^2 \sqrt{2 \pi { \ensuremath{\widetilde{\alpha}({\ensuremath{\epsilon}})}}(1-{\ensuremath{\widetilde{\alpha}({\ensuremath{\epsilon}})}})}}{8 { \ensuremath{k}}(1 -

factor in front of the @xmath117 rate . figure  [ figlevels](b ) shows how the asymptotic variances @xmath134 and @xmath135 behave as @xmath124 is increased towards @xmath136 . in this paper , we have proposed and analyzed different approaches to the problem of decentralized quantile estimation under communication constraints . our analysis focused on the fusion - centric architecture , in which a set of @xmath0 sensor nodes each collect an observation at each time step . after @xmath9 rounds of this process , the centralized oracle would be able to estimate an arbitrary quantile with mean - squared error of the order @xmath137 . in the decentralized formulation considered here , each sensor node is allowed to transmit only a single bit of information to the fusion center . we then considered a range of decentralized algorithms , indexed by the number of feedback bits that the fusion center is allowed to transmit back to the sensor nodes . in the simplest case , we showed that an @xmath138-bit feedback algorithm achieves the same asymptotic variance @xmath139 as the centralized estimator . more interestingly , we also showed that that a @xmath12-bit feedback scheme , with suitably designed step sizes , can also achieve the same asymptotic variance as the centralized oracle . we also showed that using intermediate amounts of feedback ( between @xmath12 and @xmath55 bits ) does not alter the scaling behavior , but improves the constant . finally , we showed how our algorithm can be adapted to the case of noise in the feedforward links from sensor nodes to fusion center , and the resulting effect on the asymptotic variance . our analysis in the current paper has focused only on the fusion center architecture illustrated in figure  [ fignetwork ] . a natural generalization is to consider a more general communication network , specified by an undirected graph on the sensor nodes . one possible formulation is to allow only pairs of sensor nodes connected by an edge in this communication graph to exchange a bit of information at each round . in this framework , the problem considered in this paper effectively corresponds to the complete graph , in which every node communicates with every other node at each round . this more general formulation raises interesting questions as to the effect of graph topology on the achievable rates and asymptotic variances . we would like to thank prof . pravin varaiya for some discussion that led to the initial ideas on this subject . rr was supported by the california department of transportation through the california path program . mjw was partially supported by nsf grant dms-0605165 and an nsf career award ccf-0545862 .            _ proof : @xmath119_first notice that by definition : @xmath142 \big ] , \ ] ] where @xmath14 is a @xmath143 random variable . note that if @xmath144 , with @xmath145 , then certainly @xmath146meaning that @xmath147 stochastically dominates @xmath14 . for any constant @xmath148 , @xmath149 furthermore , by the quantizer is , by definition , a monotonically non - decreasing function . consequently , a standard result on stochastic domination  @xcite implies that @xmath150 . differentiability follows from the definition of the function . the finiteness of the variance of the quantization step is clear by construction ; more specifically , a crude upper bound is @xmath151 . thus , analogous to the previous theorems , lemma  [ fq_mon_dec ] is used to establish almost sure convergence . now , some straightforward algebra using the results of lemma  [ f_mon_rate ] shows that the partial derivative @xmath152 is @xmath153 -

"distance estimates to celestial objects are one of the most fundamental measurements in astronomy and astrophysics . knowledge of the distance to astronomical sources in the sky are needed in order to estimate their physical properties , such as luminosities , masses , kinematics , and dynamics . in recent years , the technique of very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) has been used to make precise astrometric measurements ( to a precision of of a few tens of microarcseconds for a single observation ) and thus holds the promise to extend the range of the direct distance measurements of annual parallax up to at least 10 kpc with 10% accuracy using radio telescopes such as the very long baseline array ( vlba ) of the national radio astronomy obsevatory ( nrao ) . compact , bright radio -

0 ) @xcite . the water masers occur at similar line - of - sight velocities as the surrounding gas , but with a somewhat broader range ( lsr velocities @xmath552 to @xmath540 km s@xmath10 ) .    distances to iras  00420@xmath15530  of 4.3 to 7.7 kpc ( presumably kinematic , in most cases ) have been used in recent papers , despite a much closer photometric distance of 1.7 kpc @xcite . reflecting this broad range of distance estimates , luminosities of the iras source ( presumably the exciting star ) between @xmath11 and @xmath12 have been reported ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . clearly , a better distance estimate is desirable for this object . in addition , iras  00420@xmath15530  lies in the direction of the perseus arm , which has been the topic of a recent distance study by @xcite . @xcite addressed the large discrepancy between the luminosity and kinematic distance estimates in the perseus arm by accurately measuring the distance ( using vlbi techniques ) of the methanol masers in the compact hii region w3(oh ) . it is important that distances to other objects in the direction of the perseus arm be precisely measured to compare to the work presented by @xcite , and to determine small - scale deviations from the distances and kinematics in this region which could be due to peculiar motions of the studied objects . we present here a careful analysis of the observing style , calibration techniques , data reduction and parallax / proper motion fitting in order to provide the error analysis required to derive the most precise measurements of the distance to iras  00420@xmath15530 . between 2005 november and 2006 september , we made twelve 4-hour vlba observations ( approximately monthly ) of the h@xmath0o  masers in iras  00420@xmath15530  to measure their annual parallax and proper motion . the large number of monthly epochs were chosen to ensure that the parallax and proper motion fits would not be confused by maser spots fading and disappearing between epochs . in the end , most of the spots persisted through most epochs , and this was not a problem . the observations were made from the vlba s dynamic observing queue , wherein our standardized observing script was initiated opportunistically and periodically in real - time according to availability of the array , scientific ranking ( relative to fixed - schedule programs and other dynamically scheduled observations ) and other operational constraints , such as observing direction and weather . since iras 00420@xmath15530  is at relatively high declination ( and thus circumpolar at most vlba sites ) , our four - hour observation tended to rise to the top of the dynamic queue quite easily and often as a convenient schedule - filler , and so the interval between epochs was often shorter than one month . the properties of the observations are listed in table  [ tab1 ] . cllll a & 2005 nov 24 & 02:3006:30 & @xmath13 @ -17.5@xmath14 & brewster did not participate + b & 2005 dec 19 & 00:5104:51 & @xmath15 @ -16.6@xmath14 & + c & 2006 jan 08 & 23:3303:33 & @xmath16 @ -16.3@xmath14 & + d & 2006 jan 26 & 22:2202:22 & @xmath17 @ -23.7@xmath14 & + e & 2006 feb 22 & 20:3200:32 & @xmath18 @ -18.3@xmath14 & + f & 2006 mar 17 & 19:0123:01 & @xmath19 @ -19.3@xmath14 & + g & 2006 apr 08 & 17:3521:35 & @xmath20 @ -14.3@xmath14 & + h & 2006 may 08 & 15:3719:37 & @xmath21 @ -24.9@xmath14 & + i & 2006 may 31 & 13:5117:51 & @xmath22 @ -13.3@xmath14 & + j & 2006 jun 22 & 12:4016:40 & @xmath22 @ -15.3@xmath14 & + k & 2006 aug 04 & 09:5113:51 & @xmath23 @ 21.7@xmath14 & mauna kea did not participate ; epoch not used + l & 2006 sep 02 & 07:5711:57 & @xmath24 @ -16.7@xmath14 & +    four 16 mhz spectral windows were simultaneously observed in the vlba s 22 ghz band . one spectral window ( the second ) was set up to cover the h@xmath0o  maser lines in iras  00420@xmath15530  at @xmath2546 km s@xmath10 . the other three windows were distributed across the 500 mhz instantaneous if bandwidth of the vlba to provide optimal delay sensitivity for calibration of the troposphere . in addition to iras  00420@xmath15530 , nine compact background radio - loud quasars were observed as calibrators . two of these calibrators were for phase - referencing purposes to provide for accurate relative astrometry ( see table  [ tab2 ] and figure  [ calgeo ] ) . the first of these calibrators ( j0042@xmath15708 , @xmath41.41@xmath14 from iras  00420@xmath15530 ) was observed for primary phase referencing . for most of the observation , iras  00420@xmath15530  and j0042@xmath15708  were observed alternately on a @xmath460s timescale ( 30s dwell on each ) . once per hour , an alternate calibrator ( j0047@xmath15657 , @xmath40.66@xmath14 from j0042@xmath15708 ) was observed to permit verification of the phase - referencing calibration . lllll iras  00420@xmath15530 & 00@xmath2644@xmath2758@xmath28.397 & 55@xmath144647.600 & up to @xmath470.0 & science target : h@xmath0o  masers + j0042@xmath15708 & 00@xmath2642@xmath2719@xmath28.4517 & 57@xmath140836.586 & @xmath40.18 & primary phase -

referencing calibration at the vlba is limited by an zenith angle - dependent delay error arising from inaccuracies in the macroscopic troposphere model used at the vlba correlator @xcite . the seasonal zenith troposphere delay model is typically in error by many centimeters , and this leads to a significant time - dependent delay error between the science target and phase - reference calibrator since they are observed at slightly different zenith angles . as a result , the phase - referencing determined for the calibrator does not fully calibrate the target unless this macroscopic component is compensated . this effect is calibrated by observing a set of bright ( @xmath29 jy ) calibrators at a wide range of zenith angles and fitting the observed residual delays for the zenith troposphere error , assuming the delay increases away from the zenith as @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the zenith angle . the standard approach ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) is to select approximately one dozen such calibrators distributed over the entire sky and observe them 1@xmath53 times over the course of the observation to get a few instantaneous measurements of the zenith delay . such an approach does not permit tracking the delay error in time very accurately and makes no allowance for any azimuth dependence of the delay error , such as might be expected as weather changes over an antenna . our approach was to select a smaller set of calibrators distributed sufficiently in zenith angle ( @xmath32 ) at the approximate azimuth of our target , and observe them more continuously during the observation . after each observation , the data were correlated in two passes . the first pass correlated all four spectral windows at low spectral resolution ( 32 channels ) . the second pass correlated only the spectral window containing the h@xmath0o  maser lines with 1024 channels , yielding a channel spacing of 15.625 khz , and thus a spectral resolution in the lsr of 18.75 khz , or 0.253 km s@xmath10 . the visibility calibration was performed in nrao aips @xcite , following the exact same procedure for each epoch . the low - spectral - resolution data were processed first , as follows . first , several standard a priori calibrations were applied , including revised earth orientation parameter corrections ( eop , important for good astrometry ) , parallactic angle phase , quantized sampling bias amplitude corrections , and system temperature / gain amplitude calibration . second , a scan on one of the bright macroscopic troposphere calibrators ( j2202@xmath14216@xmath33bl  lac , @xmath43.0 jy ) was selected to serve as a reference for all subsequent phase and delay calibration solutions . for this scan , the net residual delay and non - linear bandpass was determined in each spectral window . this solution , applied to the rest of the data , removes constant instrumental phase and delay errors , introduces a tropospheric delay residual offset ( whatever the troposphere delay was toward j2202@xmath14216 in this scan ) , and leaves behind only relative ( and relatively small ) delay residuals that are time- and direction - dependent . these errors include any residual instrumental clock drift , zenith - angle - dependent relative macroscopic troposphere delay errors ( to be solved using the seven bright calibrators ) , and time - dependent ( phase- ) delay errors ( to be phase - referenced ) . the macroscopic troposphere delay residual calibration is obtained by applying the calibrations described above and solving for the phase in each of the four spectral windows and in each of the scans on the seven bright calibrators . these phases are then fit for multi - band delays . in general , the likelihood of ambiguity resolution problems in the multi - band delay determination are small , since these delays are residuals , and the expected zenith delay errors are expected to be only a fraction of a nanosecond . the multi - band delays are then used to jointly solve for the residual instrumental clock drift and time - dependent zenith troposphere delay error , assuming the @xmath30 model . the separation of these two effects depends upon observing the calibrators out of zenith angle order , else a monotonic clock drift would be difficult to distinguish from a component of the elevation - dependent troposphere delay residual . solutions with constant , linear , quadratic , and cubic time - dependence ( and all combinations ) in both clock and troposphere delay terms were attempted . the higher - order fits tended to diverge . optimal fits were obtained for quadratic troposphere and linear clock . typical zenith delay residuals were found to be a few to 15 cm , with variations over four hours at the 1@xmath52 cm level . the overall accuracy of this delay calibration is approximately 0.5@xmath51.0 cm , and is limited by the simplicity of the zenith angle dependence and unmodeled local time - variation of the troposphere delay ( of the sort we would otherwise phase - reference ) . since this is a residual effect , negative troposphere delay solutions are possible . also , the troposphere delay solution is not referenced to any specific antenna since the zenith angle dependence and differential zenith angle sampling at each antenna breaks the usual degeneracy . figure [ mtpherr ] shows , for epoch a , the systematic phase - referencing errors for iras  00420@xmath15530  and j0047@xmath15657  due to their time - dependent zenith angle difference relative to j0042@xmath15708  and the ( mean ) zenith delay model calibration determined as described above . the zenith delay errors range in magnitude from 0.6 cm for kp to 13.5 cm for hn ( br did not participate , and sc was excluded ) . the errors are generally larger for iras  00420@xmath15530  since it has a larger separation from j0042@xmath15708 , and at a relatively unfavorable position angle ( near transit ) that maximizes the zenith angle difference . only for the easternmost antennas in the array ( hn , nl ) , which are observing farthest from transit , is the position angle of j0047@xmath15657  relative to j0042@xmath15708sufficient to excessively amplify this systematic phase error .    the vlba station at st . croix ( sc ) was generally the worst performing station in the delay calibration , yielding poor multi - band delay fits and/or poor zenith delay solutions . this is caused by excessive and highly variable tropospheric water vapor at sc s sea - level location and humid climate . since this station also yields the least accurate phase referencing solutions for the same reasons , it was excised from all epochs . this results in the loss of many relatively long baselines , but the poor calibration of these baselines would be of questionable value .    at this point , the high - spectral - resolution data were processed , first with all of the same _ a priori _ calibrations as the low - resolution data . the tropospheric delay calibration solution ( including the clock drift ) was then transferred from the low - resolution dataset , to be used as an additional a priori calibration for the high - resolution data . the same strong calibrator scan was selected to obtain the global instrumental reference calibration , except a polynomial bandpass was used since the per - channel snr was insufficient for a sampled bandpass at the high spectral resolution . finally , the phase - reference calibration was determined on j0042@xmath15708 . the full calibration was then applied to iras  00420@xmath15530 , j0042@xmath15708 , and the secondary phase - reference calibrator , j0047@xmath15657 . after re - sampling the velocity axis for each epoch to the lsr , the data were exported in uvfits format . the data for each epoch were then imaged in difmap @xcite , selecting the channels with maser emission . first , a relatively low spatial resolution image of a wide field - of - view was generated to spatially locate significant maser regions , then each of these regions were imaged at full resolution . a simple multi - field clean deconvolution script was developed in difmap to optimize the imaging of channels with signal in more than one region . figure [ skyfig ] shows the spatial distribution of the maser regions ( integrated clean components from epoch a ) , integrated in velocity . there are nine major maser spot regions , two of which ( 4 and 7 ) contain two distinct maser spots , with significant emission in a total of 44 channels . the typical imaging sensitivity achieved per channel was 100@xmath5200 mjy / beam , with maser peaks ranging up to @xmath475 jy beam@xmath10 . figure [ integspecfig ] shows the spectrum of iras  00420@xmath15530 integrated over all maser spot regions , for a representative set of epochs ( a , d , g , and j ) , indicating the overall variability of the source . figure [ dynspecfig ] shows separately the time - dependent spectra for maser regions 14 . a variety of spectral structure and behavior is observed . regions 1 and 3 show strong , stable , and simple spectral structure . region 2 shows a monotonic drift of five channels in the peak of emission . region 4 shows two distinct spectral components : the feature at @xmath34 km s@xmath10  drifts by about one channel and fades , while the feature at @xmath35 km s@xmath10 , indistinct at epoch a , grows in strength with epoch and is stationary in velocity . the remaining regions ( not shown ) are generally weaker , and show a similar range of structure and variability . of these , maser region 5 is the most stable . as shown below , the spectral structure and variability has serious consequences for obtaining reliable parallax and proper motion fits . 5530  at epochs a , d , g , and j. [ integspecfig ] ]    ]    to obtain an estimate of the fundamental phase - referencing accuracy of these observations , continuum images ( bandwidth : 14 mhz ) of the secondary phase - reference calibrator , j0047@xmath15657(snr@xmath420 ) , were generated . for the ensemble of epochs ( excluding epoch k ) , the rms peak position of j0047@xmath15657  is @xmath3630 @xmath37as in both right ascension and declination , with no evidence of any significant systematic motion . ( without the macroscopic troposphere solution applied , the declination rms increases by a factor of 2 , indicating the importance of this calibration . ) this estimate establishes a basis for estimating the astrometric precision ( per snr ) of the maser observations . specifically , a snr of @xmath420 nominally corresponds to an astrometric precision of @xmath430 @xmath37as .    this error estimate can not be transferred and scaled directly to the observations of iras  00420@xmath15530 . a variety of systematic errors render themselves differently for iras  00420@xmath15530  and j0047@xmath15657 . j0047@xmath15657  is only 0.66@xmath14 from j0042@xmath15708 , the primary calibrator , less than half the 1.41@xmath14 j0042@xmath15708iras  00420@xmath15530  separation , and so the phase - referencing calibration is nominally more accurate for j0047@xmath15657 . furthermore , near transit at the center of the vlba , the position angle of the j0042@xmath15708j0047@xmath15657  separation is mostly in azimuth while that of j0047@xmath15657iras  00420@xmath15530  is mostly in zenith angle ( see figure [ calgeo ] ) , making any residuals in the zenith angle - dependent macroscopic troposphere calibration more important for iras  00420@xmath15530 . as described below , these and other systematic errors place more stringent limits on the astrometric precision of iras  00420@xmath15530 , despite the fact that most of the maser spots used in the parallax fitting have higher snr than j0047@xmath15657 . parallax and proper motion calculations rely on measurements of the time - dependent direction of consistently identified , small , physically coherent objects relative to a distant , presumed stationary , background reference , in this case , the phase reference calibrator . masers are among the most compact observable objects available , but at the resolution of the vlba , they are generally not strictly point - like . furthermore , it is not clear to what degree masers can be characterized as distinct physical objects since they likely arise not from fixed discrete objects , but rather from coherent velocity structures within a presumably larger physical structure ( e.g. , gas cloud ) .    indeed , most of the maser spots in iras  00420@xmath15530  are clearly not strictly point - like and are variable in their marginally resolved structure and flux density from epoch to epoch . furthermore , the spectral structure of each maser spot is generally non - trivial , with the peak for some spots clearly drifting substantially in velocity from epoch - to - epoch . these factors make reliable epoch - to - epoch identification of distinct physical features difficult . therefore , rather than fitting complicated multiple point and resolved gaussian model components to the images or visibilities , and thereby introducing an additional unphysical component in the analysis , we have adopted the simple peak position ( fitted from image pixels ) as the best estimate of the maser position , and have accepted the inevitable intrinsic variation of this estimate ( a form of traditional confusion within the synthesized beam ) as an additional source of error in our analysis .    for each of eleven distinct spots in 9 spot regions , and in each channel with significant power ( see below ) , we have fitted the sequence of peak positions for parallax and two - dimensional proper motion , according to the standard equation : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the annual parallax , @xmath40 is time , @xmath41 is the 2-dimensional proper motion , @xmath42 denote the maser position at @xmath43 , and @xmath44 is a 2-dimensional function of direction and time describing the parallax ellipse ( the reflection of the earth s orbit onto the sky ) . in using this equation , we nominally assume that any non - linear internal motions with the maser spot regions are negligible . this yielded 44 estimates of the proper motion and parallax of iras  00420@xmath15530 , and the results are listed in table [ tab3 ] . an example fit is shown in figures [ parallaxskyfig ] and [ parallaxtimefig ] .    crrlrrrrrr    1 & -43.4 & 11 & abcdefghij l & * 0.44 * ( 0.02 ) & -2.06 ( 0.08 ) & -1.88 ( 0.05 ) & 32 & 45 & 55 + 1 & -43.6 & 11 & abcdefghij l & * 0.44 * ( 0.02 ) & -2.10 ( 0.07 ) & -1.95 ( 0.05 ) & 29 & 38 & 47 + 1 & -43.9 & 11 & abcdefghij l & * 0.44 * ( 0.02 ) & -1.94 ( 0.06 ) & -1.72 ( 0.04 ) & 31 & 29 & 42 + 1 & -44.1 & 11 & abcdefghij l & * 0.48 * ( 0.02 ) & -2.05 ( 0.07 ) & -1.63 ( 0.05 ) & 23 & 43 & 48 + 1 & -44.3 & 11 & abcdefghij l & * 0.49 * ( 0.03 ) & -2.09 ( 0.09 ) & -1.65 ( 0.07 ) & 28 & 56 & 62 + & & & & & & & & & + 3 & -45.8 & 11 & abcdefghij l & * 0.48 * ( 0.01 ) & -2.55 ( 0.05 ) & -0.89 ( 0.04 ) & 19 & 30 & 36 + 3 & -46.0 & 11 & abcdefghij l & * 0.45 * ( 0.01 ) & -2.52 ( 0.05 ) & -0.84 ( 0.04 ) & 19 & 31 & 36 + 3 & -46.2 & 11 & abcdefghij l & * 0.45 * ( 0.01 ) & -2.52 ( 0.05 ) & -0.89 ( 0.04 ) & 18 & 32 & 37 + & & & & & & & & & + 4a & -46.6 & 6 & abcdef & 0.50 ( 0.06 ) & -2.67 ( 0.13 ) & -1.92 ( 0.25 ) & 26 & 19 & 32 + 4a & -46.8 & 6 & abcdef & 0.49 ( 0.06 ) & -2.66 ( 0.13 ) & -1.97 ( 0.25 ) & 25 & 20 & 32 + 4a & -47.2 & 6 & abcdef & 0.50 ( 0.05 ) & -2.62 ( 0.10 ) & -1.93 ( 0.20 ) & 23 & 11 & 25 + & & & & & & & & & + 4b & -47.4 & 8 & defghij l & * 0.43 * ( 0.02 ) & -2.34 ( 0.08 ) & -1.85 ( 0.08 ) & 18 & 27 & 32 + 4b & -47.6 & 8 & defghij l & * 0.44 * ( 0.02 ) & -2.40 ( 0.08 ) & -1.88 ( 0.08 ) & 22 & 23 & 32 + & & & & & & & & & + 5 & -43.2 & 10 & abcdefghij & * 0.50 * ( 0.02 ) & -2.65 ( 0.09 ) & -1.05 ( 0.06 ) & 32 & 19 & 38 + 5 & -43.4 & 10 & abcdefghij & * 0.47 * ( 0.03 ) & -2.48 ( 0.13 ) & -1.18 ( 0.08 ) & 40 & 30 & 50 + & & & & & & & & & +    7b & -43.9 & 7 & abcdefg & 0.62 ( 0.05 ) & -5.79 ( 0.17 ) & -0.53 ( 0.19 ) & 25 & 28 & 38 + 7b & -44.1 & 7 & abcdefg & 0.51 ( 0.04 ) & -5.33 ( 0.12 ) & -0.77 ( 0.14 ) & 20 & 18 & 27 + 7b & -44.3 & 7 & abcdefg & 0.51 ( 0.04 ) & -5.29 ( 0.12 ) & -0.77 ( 0.13 ) & 15 & 19 & 25 + 7b & -44.5 & 7 & abcdefg & 0.50 ( 0.04 ) & -5.29 ( 0.14 ) & -0.81 ( 0.14 ) & 21 & 17 & 27 + & & & & & & & & & + 8 & -47.4 & 7 & abcdefg & 0.59 ( 0.10 ) & -5.51 ( 0.31 ) & -1.23 ( 0.34 ) & 61 & 48 & 77 + 8 & -47.6 & 7 & abcdefg & 0.56 ( 0.09 ) & -5.71 ( 0.28 ) & -1.18 ( 0.33 ) & 63 & 36 & 73 + 8 & -47.9 & 7 & abcdefg & 0.48 ( 0.09 ) & -5.65 ( 0.27 ) & -1.39 ( 0.32 ) & 63 & 28 & 69 + 8 & -48.1 & 7 & abcdefg & 0.41 ( 0.08 ) & -5.57 ( 0.24 ) & -1.60 ( 0.28 ) & 54 & 23 & 59 + & & & & & & & & & + 9 & -49.3 & 8 & abcdefgh & * 0.43 * ( 0.04 ) & -5.01 ( 0.16 ) & -1.15 ( 0.13 ) & 35 & 30 & 46 + 9 & -49.5 & 10 & abcdefghij & * 0.43 * ( 0.03 ) & -4.99 ( 0.13 ) & -1.21 ( 0.09 ) & 32 & 41 & 52 + 9 & -49.8 & 10 & abcdefghij & * 0.48 * ( 0.03 ) & -5.17 ( 0.11 ) & -1.24 ( 0.08 ) & 36 & 26 & 44 + 9 & -50.0 & 8 & abcdefgh & * 0.48 * ( 0.03 ) & -5.14 ( 0.10 ) & -1.42 ( 0.09 ) & 20 & 20 & 28 +    2 & -44.5 & 10 & abcdefghij & 0.46 ( 0.04 ) & -1.21 ( 0.16 ) & -2.48 ( 0.11 ) & 32 & 56 & 65 + 2 & -44.7 & 10 & abcdefghij & 0.52 ( 0.04 ) & -1.53 ( 0.14 ) & -2.42 ( 0.09 ) & 34 & 47 & 58 + 2 & -44.9 & 10 & abcdefghij & 0.61 ( 0.04 ) & -1.79 ( 0.17 ) & -2.83 ( 0.10 ) & 36 & 57 & 67 + 2 & -45.1 & 10 & abcdefghij & 0.48 ( 0.07 ) & -1.22 ( 0.28 ) & -3.50 ( 0.16 ) & 58 & 100 & 115 + 2 & -45.3 & 10 & abcdefghij & 0.35 ( 0.10 ) & -0.72 ( 0.41 ) & -3.73 ( 0.24 ) & 117 & 120 & 167 + 2 & -45.5 & 10 & abcdefghij & 0.25 ( 0.15 ) & -0.92 ( 0.59 ) & -2.83 ( 0.36 ) & 144 & 239 & 279 + & & & & & & & & & + 6 & -44.7 & 10 & abcdefghij & 0.83 ( 0.51 ) & -4.40 ( 2.10 ) & -11.01 ( 1.11 ) & 161 & 901 & 915 + 6 & -44.9 & 10 & abcdefghij & 1.11 ( 0.44 ) & -5.34 ( 1.70 ) & -10.22 ( 0.93 ) & 251 & 779 & 819 + 6 & -45.1 & 10 & abcdefghij & 0.90 ( 0.45 ) & -4.61 ( 1.71 ) & -10.27 ( 0.99 ) & 211 & 797 & 824 + 6 & -45.3 & 10 & abcdefghij & 0.82 ( 0.42 ) & -4.28 ( 1.56 ) & -10.18 ( 0.95 ) & 199 & 796 & 820 + & & & & & & & & & + 7a & -43.2 & 7 & abcdefg & 0.16 ( 1.60 ) & -13.68 ( 5.07 ) & 0.25 ( 5.43 ) & 908 & 889 & 1271 + 7a & -43.4 & 7 & abcdefg & -2.89 ( 2.30 ) & 2.45 ( 6.92 ) & -14.79 ( 8.06 ) & 1307 & 1227 & 1793 + 7a & -43.6 & 7 & abcdefg & -0.43 ( 1.79 ) & -11.18 ( 5.47 ) & -3.06 ( 6.35 ) & 961 & 1014 & 1397 + 7a & -43.9 & 7 & abcdefg & -1.06 ( 1.89 ) & -8.59 ( 6.32 ) & -4.96 ( 6.32 ) & 873 & 1017 & 1340 +    for the fitting , only channels with maser spot detections greater than @xmath412 jy ( corresponding to snr @xmath45 10 , typically ) were included . additionally , after a trial fit , partial epoch ranges for some spots were discarded where it was evident that the assumption of a consistent discrete physical component following the relatively simple parallax and proper motion trajectory was violated . presumably , the peak derived from our finite - resolution observations shifted abruptly as a result of intrinsic structural changes . epoch k was excluded entirely since the mauna kea station , which provides the longest baselines , did not participate . the fits for three maser regions ( 2 , 6 , & 7a ) were rejected outright from further analysis on the basis of poor consistency among channels or unphysical ( negative ) parallax estimates . each of these regions show substantial spectral complexity , including variation in the velocity of peak emission , indicating that they are non - ideal test - particles for parallax measurements . no degree of judicious epoch selection makes these maser regions recoverable for parallax estimation purposes . determining proper epoch- and maser - dependent weights for the fitting process is non - trivial , since accurate _ total _ errors , including systematics , for the peak position estimates are not readily available _ a priori_. formally , for a well - isolated point source with no systematic errors , the precision of the peak position estimates would be inversely proportional to the snr of the peak emission , and the resulting formal weights would be proportional to the _ square _ of the snr . in practice , such an estimate of astrometric precision must be a lower limit due to systematic errors arising from the complicating maser structure considerations noted above , as well as to per - epoch residuals in the macroscopic troposphere and phase - referencing calibration . additionally , the wide range of flux densities among maser regions and epochs ( @xmath4260 jy ) result in a range of weights of 2 orders of magnitude or more for some maser spots . such weights could have a deleterious effect on the effective sampling of the parallax ellipse during the year , and lead to complicated biases in the parallax estimates . therefore , we adopted weights proportional to snr ( i.e. , the square root of the formal weights ) for the final fits . for most of the fits , this choice was not consequential ; use of the formal weights yields parameter estimates not significantly different from that obtained with snr weights . our parallax measurement is not limited by per - epoch snr , but rather by _ per - epoch _ systematic errors in the astrometry . while the proper motions may be expected to vary among the spot regions ( and even among channels in a single region ) due to intrinsic internal motions , the parallax estimates should be consistent for all of them since the range of maser emission is very small ( @xmath46 mas ) relative to its distance ( kiloparsecs ) , and is unlikely to be significantly deeper than it is wide . in practice , the variation of the parallax estimates among maser spot regions and channels is more complicated . while several ( but not all ) maser regions show impressive internal consistency , the dispersion of parallax estimates over the entire ensemble is considerably larger than the formal errors would imply . this fact is related to residual systematic errors affecting the fits which originate in the complexity and evolution of the spectral and spatial structure of the maser regions , residual calibration errors , and the details of the time - dependent sampling of the parallax ellipse .    at any single epoch , calibration errors will affect different maser spot regions uniformly , and so are systematic , i.e. , relative position measurements among masers at one epoch have no information about the magnitude of such errors . over many epochs ( up to eleven , in this case ) , however , we assume such errors can be treated as approximately stochastic . similarly , after excising obviously discrepant epochs as described above , we treat any _ non - linear _ intrinsic variations in the peak position due to internal structural and flux density evolution as approximately stochastic over many epochs . these errors limit the precision of the parallax estimate , but are unlikely to bias it substantially . with up to eleven epochs per fit , we assert that the rms residuals determined in the fits are a reasonable estimate of the mean per - epoch astrometric precision achieved in our observations , typically @xmath47as in both dimensions . the error bars in figure [ parallaxtimefig ] reflect the relative weights used in the fit , and are conservatively scaled so that their minimum is 30 @xmath37as .    of the remaining 27 fits in 8 maser regions , most yield internally consistent parallax and proper motions ( with channel ) , but the overall range of parallax results remains relatively large : 0.41 - 0.62 mas , with formal errors in the range 0.01 - 0.1 mas ( see figure [ parallaxhist ] which shows the distribution in the range 0.40 - 0.52 mas ) . in addition to several obvious outliers ( there are three such outliers greater than 0.55 mas and not shown in figure [ parallaxhist ] ) , there is some evidence of maser region - dependent systematic errors . a careful analysis of the time - dependent weighted sampling shows that those maser regions for which the later epochs were undetected or discarded tend to yield systematically higher parallax estimates ( near or in excess of 0.50 mas ) compared to those with more complete sampling . fitting trials on the completely sampled maser regions ( e.g. , region 3 ) using _ only _ the early epochs confirm this effect . we therefore have discarded maser regions 4a , 7b , and 8 as insufficiently sampled and inadequate for further consideration . the remaining 16 maser region channels are shown in the filled histogram of figure [ parallaxhist ] . the distribution still appears bimodal , but the two states can not be segregated according to maser region . the unweighted dispersion of the remaining measurements is 0.02 mas , broadly consistent with the typical formal errors in the individual fits , which arise from a combination of pure statistics and per - epoch systematics that are stochastic over many epochs . the individual parallax solutions for the remaining 16 maser region channels have been averaged with weights derived from their formal errors to yield a net parallax estimate of 0.458@xmath360.005 mas . figure [ finalest ] shows the final parallax signature in right ascension and declination as a function of time ( bold curve ) also plotted are the per - channel data ( filled and open dots , with error bars as in figure [ parallaxtimefig ] ) and the range of individual channel fits ( hashed region ) ; the fitted proper motions and relative position offsets from the individual solutions have been removed . it is clear that several epochs ( e.g. , epoch c in right ascension , epochs i and l in declination ) are affected by a substantial residual systematic offset in one dimension or the other , but that for most epochs , the magnitude of these systematics is similar or smaller than the statistical distribution of measurements . since the parallax solution has been derived directly from the data , it is difficult to accurately ascertain the true balance between the per - epoch systematic and statistical contributions . although the formal errors in each individual maser channel solution nominally account for both sources of error ( assuming the per - epoch systematics are approximately stochastic over many epochs ) , we nonetheless conservatively double the formal error estimate and adopt a final parallax estimate of 0.46@xmath360.01 mas . the distance to iras  00420@xmath15530  is therefore 2.17@xmath360.05 kpc , a measurement with a precision of @xmath33% . with direct measurements of the distance and three - dimensional space velocity of objects such as iras  00420@xmath15530  using the vlba , it becomes possible to more accurately evaluate the veracity of the kinematic distances derived from galactic rotation curves , and to do so over a larger portion of the galaxy than with any other available means . this is especially important outside the solar circle where rotation curve analyses have had to rely principally on photometric and other indirect distance estimates . a large range of distance estimates for iras  00420@xmath15530  have been used in the literature for various astrophysical analyses . most tabulated distances have been in the range @xmath48@xmath49 kpc , and are presumably kinematic in origin . our h@xmath0o  maser parallax distance of 2.17 kpc is , in fact , most consistent with the oldest published distance estimate , a photometric distance of 1.7 kpc @xcite .    the direct geometric distance estimate reported here is more than a factor of two closer than the kinematic distance of @xmath44.7 kpc implied by a radial velocity of @xmath50 km s@xmath10  using the rotation curve of @xcite ( henceforth , bb93 ) . however , those authors acknowledge systematic offsets from their rotation curve in the sample they use to derive it ( hii regions and reflection nebulae ) , including the fact that it overestimates the ( galactocentric ) orbital velocities of most objects within @xmath43 kpc outside the solar circle . furthermore , at the galactic longitude and distance of iras  00420@xmath15530 , in particular , their line - of - sight velocity residuals show a systematic deficit of @xmath425 km s@xmath10 ; their rotation curve nominally predicts a radial velocity of @xmath525 km s@xmath10  for iras  00420@xmath15530 , @xmath421 km s@xmath10  slower than observed . similar large - scale systematic residuals occur at many outer galaxy longitudes , and they attribute this to non - circular galactic orbits , or more generally , the inadequacy of an axisymmetric model for the velocity field of the outer galaxy . in short , although the rotation curve predicts galactic orbital velocities with errors of only 10@xmath515% ( out of 200@xmath5250 km s@xmath10 ) , it is a much poorer predictor of _ line - of - sight _ velocities measured at the sun , and so kinematic distance estimates for the outer galaxy will be generally unreliable .    since our vlba measurements provide the three - dimensional space velocity ( relative to the sun ) of iras 00420@xmath15530 , it is possible to explore the nature of its galactic orbit in detail . adopting the maser component in region 3 , @xmath51 km s@xmath10  as representative for iras  00420@xmath15530 we find a _ heliocentric _ line - of - sight velocity of @xmath52 km s@xmath10 , and , at a distance of 2.17 kpc , a ( heliocentric ) physical velocity of @xmath53 km s@xmath10 in galactic longitude and @xmath54 km s@xmath10  in galactic latitude ( at the distance of iras  00420@xmath15530 , 1 milliarcsecond year@xmath10 @xmath33 10.3 km s@xmath10 ) . figure [ galplanobs ] illustrates the in - plane components of these measurements in a plan view of the region of the galaxy containing the sun and iras  00420@xmath15530 . formally , the error in these velocities is @xmath40.5 km s@xmath10 , but there is a full range of @xmath410 km s@xmath10  in the line - of - sight and latitude components , and somewhat less in the longitude components among the brightest maser spot regions . we assume tentatively that the internal motion of this component is not large enough to excessively bias our analysis ( this point will be addressed in greater detail below ) . the following analysis is limited by the accuracy of knowledge of the absolute orbital speed of the galaxy and the sun s peculiar motion relative to the lsr . we have provisionally assumed standard iau values for the lsr parameters , namely that it is @xmath55 kpc from the galactic center and moving at @xmath56 km s@xmath10  on a circular orbit @xcite . the sun s peculiar motion relative to the lsr has been assumed to be @xmath57 km s@xmath10  ( toward the galactic center ) , @xmath58 km s@xmath10  ( along the orbit ) , and @xmath59 km s@xmath10  ( out of the plane ) as measured by @xcite using hipparcos data . the calculations have be done in three dimensions , but with no correction for the sun s unknown distance from the galactic plane .    converting to the galactocentric frame by correcting for @xmath60 and solar peculiar motions , we find that iras  00420@xmath15530  is moving toward the galactic center at 23.0 km s@xmath10 , around the galaxy ( circular component ) at 202.0 km s@xmath10 , and toward the plane ( from below ) at 5.8 km s@xmath10 . the in - plane components of iras  00420@xmath15530 s velocity vector are shown in figure [ irasgal ] . thus , iras  00420@xmath15530  is moving significantly slower than the circular speed of @xmath4224 km s@xmath10  predicted by the bb93 rotation curve , and has a substantial non - circular component toward the galactic center .    by assuming a nominal orbital speed for iras  00420@xmath15530 , we can shift our velocity measurements to a local standard of rest orbiting the galaxy at the position of iras  00420@xmath15530 . figure [ irascorot220 ] shows the resulting in - plane peculiar motion of iras  00420@xmath15530 , assuming its orbital speed is 220 km s@xmath10 . ( the bb93 rotation curve prediction is insignificantly larger ; essentially we nominally assume the rotation curve is flat in this region of the galaxy . ) also shown is the peculiar motion of w3(oh ) ( also in its _ own _ standard of rest ) as reported by @xcite , also assuming an orbital speed of 220 km s@xmath10 . the peculiar motions of iras  00420@xmath15530  and w3(oh ) are in almost exactly the same direction , and very nearly in the direction of the sun . combined with the large - scale systematic line - of - sight velocity deficit observed in the bb93 rotation curve residuals , this is highly suggestive of a large - scale anomalous motion of the material in this region of the galaxy , i.e. , the perseus spiral arm , in a direction toward the sun . such anomalous motion could be related to the formation and propagation of the perseus spiral arm , and is evidence of the inadequacy of axisymmetric models of galactic rotation . an obvious alternative to this conclusion is that the sun has a large velocity component in the direction of these objects , either in terms of the lsr orbital speed , the solar peculiar motion , or both . indeed , the orbital speed component of the sun s velocity is the least well - understood component of its motion due to uncertainties in the overall scale of the galaxy ( @xmath61 and @xmath60 ) , and the component of solar peculiar motion in the direction of galactic rotation . however , the velocity adjustments required of the alternative scenarios are generally implausible . increasing the galactic orbital speed for the solar lsr to 250 km s@xmath10  ( the value favored by @xcite for @xmath62 kpc according to measurements of the proper motion of sgr a@xmath63 ) and maintaining the flat rotation curve out to iras  00420@xmath15530  and w3(oh ) reduces the radial ( toward the galactic center ) component of the anomalous velocity by only @xmath46 km s@xmath10 , without substantially changing the orbital component . the anomaly is even less sensitive to adjusting _ both _ the orbital speed and @xmath61 in such a way as to keep the _ angular _ speed ( @xmath64 ) of the solar lsr constant @xcite . this insensitivity is a result of the relatively small angle ( @xmath411@xmath14 ) subtended at the galactic center by the sun and iras  00420@xmath15530 , and that this angle changes very slowly for a fixed distance to iras  00420@xmath15530  ( our measurement ) over the plausible range of @xmath61 ( 8 @xmath36 1 kpc ) . introducing a difference in nominal orbital speed between the sun and these sources sufficient to account for the anomaly is also implausible , implying zero additional mass outside the solar circle , and would not compensate for the radial component of the anomaly . finally , a sufficient correction to just the solar peculiar motion would require a change to the radial component of @xmath420 km s@xmath10 , entirely inconsistent with the hipparcos measurements of @xcite . it is also possible that we have failed to model a large internal motion of the h@xmath0o  masers in iras  00420@xmath15530  that happens to lie in the direction of the apparent anomalous motion , a possibility noted by @xcite for w3(oh ) . however , we consider this unlikely given the relatively modest range of three - dimensional velocities observed for the main h@xmath0o  masers in iras  00420@xmath15530 , and that they are near ( @xmath65 5 km s@xmath10 ) the systemic velocity indicated by other molecular species in iras  00420@xmath15530 . the maser channel chosen for this analysis ( region 3 , @xmath66 km s@xmath10 ) is reasonably representative of the available information for iras  00420@xmath15530 . other choices are possible , but either can be excluded on grounds of insufficient constraints or do not substantively change the result . the maser regions excluded from the parallax analysis have proper motion estimates biased toward more negative velocities in longitude due to poor sampling of the parallax ellipse in the late epochs . of the remaining 16 well - sampled maser channels used in the parallax analysis , only region 9 differs in the longitude component of its proper motion by more than @xmath45 km s@xmath10  ( at the longitude of iras  00420@xmath15530 , equatorial and galactic coordinates are approximately parallel , so @xmath67 ) . the dispersion in the latitude component is somewhat larger , but it is irrelevant to the space velocity analysis within the galactic plane . region 9 has a velocity in longitude @xmath425 km s@xmath10  more negative than region 3 . alternatively choosing region 9 as representative ameliorates the anomaly in the circular orbital component of the velocity found in the above analysis for region 3 quite well , but also _ increases _ the anomalous component in the direction of the galactic center . while we consider the remarkable consistency with the w3(oh ) anomalous space velocity compelling , it is not , by itself , sufficient evidence of any interpretation of possible internal motions in iras  00420@xmath15530 . without an absolute reference within the source , internal motion biases can not be ruled out , but an anomalous motion in the general direction of the sun and the galactic center can not be excluded by the available h@xmath0o  maser proper motion data . distance and three - dimensional space velocity measurements of a larger sample of such objects in this and other regions of the galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) are necessary to resolve such issues conclusively , and establish the true bulk motion of material in the perseus spiral arm . such observations could possibly also better constrain the galactic orbital speed and solar peculiar motion , but will be limited by the isotropy and homogeneity ( i.e. , the apparent lack of galactic axisymmetry ) of the available sample . @xcite have measured the distance to ngc  281a star -

bubble in their model . using the vlba , we have measured the parallax and three - dimensional space velocity of h@xmath0o  masers in iras  00420@xmath15530 . the parallax of 0.46@xmath360.01 mas provides a purely geometric distance estimate of 2.17@xmath360.05 kpc ( @xmath69% ) , a factor of two closer than popularly assumed kinematic distance estimates suggest , yet consistent with an older , far - less accurate photometric distance . at this distance , the space velocity of iras  00420@xmath15530  shows a substantial anomalous component in the direction of the sun , consistent with similar observations of w3(oh ) , implying a significant non - circular systematic motion of the perseus spiral arm of the galaxy . parallax observations of larger samples of maser sources using the vlba have the potential to extend the distance estimates of a few % accuracy to a large fraction of the galaxy , and will contribute to more accurate non -

"the new generation of radioactive ion beam facilities will provide high intensity ( @xmath3 ions / s ) exotic beams ( for example , @xmath4kr , @xmath5sn , @xmath6xe or @xmath7cs ) . one of the most interesting areas of research with radioactive beams will be the study of the complete fusion process  @xcite where the fusion experiments with exotic beams can be performed to synthesize and study new isotopes of existing elements . the central issue is whether the capture and fusion cross sections will be enhanced due to the large deformation of the neutron - rich or neutron - deficient projectile - nucleus . however , one should bear in mind the smaller intensity of these beams in comparison with the intensity of stable beams . our aim is to find the global trend in the production cross section of exotic nuclei as a function of the charge ( mass ) number of the projectile in complete fusion reactions . based on this trend one can find a consensus between the cross sections resulting from a certain beam and the intensity of this beam .    the goal of the present paper is to compare the fusion of stable @xmath8xe and radioactive @xmath9xe beams with the same target , @xmath1ca , in order to study the effects of the neutron excess and neutron transfer on the fusion process . the target @xmath1ca is ideal for this purpose since this nucleus has the largest possible neutron excess and the systems @xmath9xe+@xmath1ca have positive neutron transfer @xmath10-values while all the corresponding reactions @xmath8xe+@xmath1ca display negative @xmath10-values . in the present paper we demonstrate for the first time the possibilities for producing neutron - rich isotopes of @xmath2w in the complete fusion reactions @xmath11xe+@xmath1ca with rather large cross sections . the nucleus @xmath12w was the heaviest isotope which has been synthesized in ( @xmath13,@xmath14 ) and ( @xmath15,@xmath16 ) reactions @xcite . in these experiments the chemical extraction of @xmath12w was possible after long irradiation . another method to produce the neutron - rich nuclei is fragmentation reactions  @xcite . cross - sections smaller than 0.4@xmath17b were measured for the isotopes @xmath18w in cold fragmentation of 950 mev / nucleon @xmath19au beams on be targets @xcite . however , the production cross section decreases strongly with increasing neutron number . the most neutron - rich w isotopes , up to @xmath19w , were observed in projectile fragmentation of @xmath20u at 1 gev / nucleon on be targets at the fragment separator ( frs ) at gsi @xcite . here , cross - sections smaller than 5 nb were measured for w isotopes with mass numbers a @xmath21 190 where the cross - section decreases by approximately one order of magnitude for every two neutrons more in the residual nucleus . in the present paper we also compare the complete fusion reactions @xmath22xe+@xmath1ca with fragmentation reactions leading both to the production of neutron - rich w isotopes . additionally , we will compare the complete fusion reactions @xmath23cs+@xmath24ga which lead to neutron - deficient rn isotopes with the respective yields from the fragmentation reactions . because the capture cross section is equal to the fusion cross section for the reactions @xmath25xe+@xmath1ca treated in the present paper , the quantum diffusion approach @xcite for the capture is applied to study the complete fusion . with this approach many heavy - ion capture reactions at energies above and well below the coulomb barrier have been successfully described  @xcite . since the details of our theoretical treatment were already published in refs . @xcite , the model will be only shortly described .    in the quantum diffusion approach @xcite the collisions of nuclei are described with a single relevant collective variable : the relative distance between the colliding nuclei . this approach takes into consideration the fluctuation and dissipation effects in collisions of heavy ions which model the coupling with various channels ( for example , coupling of the relative motion with low - lying collective modes such as dynamical quadrupole and octupole modes of the target and projectile @xcite ) . we have to mention that many quantum - mechanical and non - markovian effects accompanying the passage through the coulomb barrier are taken into consideration in our formalism @xcite . the diffusion models , which include the quantum statistical effects , were also proposed in refs . the nuclear deformation effects are taken into account through the dependence of the nucleus - nucleus potential on the deformations and mutual orientations of the colliding nuclei . to calculate the nucleus - nucleus interaction potential @xmath26 , we use the procedure presented in ref . @xcite . for the nuclear part of the nucleus - nucleus potential , the double - folding formalism with a skyrme - type density - dependent effective nucleon - nucleon interaction is used @xcite . the nucleon densities of the projectile and target nuclei are specified in the form of the woods - saxon parameterization , where the nuclear radius parameter is @xmath27 fm and the diffuseness parameter takes the values @xmath28 fm for all nuclei . the absolute values of the quadrupole deformation parameters @xmath29 of deformed nuclei were taken from refs . @xcite and @xcite for the known and unknown nuclei , respectively . for the magic @xmath1ca and semimagic @xmath30xe nuclei in the ground state , we set @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively .    the capture cross section is the sum of the partial capture cross sections @xcite @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the reduced de broglie wavelength , @xmath35 is the reduced mass ( @xmath36 is the nucleon mass ) , and the summation is over the possible values of the angular momentum @xmath37 at a given bombarding energy @xmath38 . knowing the potential of the interacting nuclei for each orientation with the angles @xmath39 , one can obtain the partial capture probability @xmath40 which is defined by the probability to penetrate the potential barrier in the relative distance coordinate @xmath41 at a given @xmath37 . the value of @xmath40 is obtained by integrating the propagator @xmath42 from the initial state @xmath43 at time @xmath44 to the final state @xmath45 at time @xmath46 ( @xmath47 is the momentum ) : @xmath48 . \label{1ab_eq}\end{aligned}\ ] ] here , @xmath49 is an internal turning point . the second line in ( [ 1ab_eq ] ) is obtained by using the propagator @xmath50 ( @xmath51 $ ] , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 ) calculated for an inverted oscillator which approximates the nucleus - nucleus potential @xmath59 in the variable @xmath41 as follows . at given @xmath38 and @xmath37 , the classical action is calculated for the realistic nucleus - nucleus potential . then the realistic nucleus - nucleus potential is replaced by an inverted oscillator which has the same barrier height and classical action . so , the frequency @xmath60 of this oscillator is set to obtain an equality of the classical actions in the approximated and realistic potentials . the action is calculated in the wkb approximation which is the accurate at the sub - barrier energies . usually in the literature the parabolic approximation with @xmath38-independent @xmath61 is employed which is not accurate at the deep sub - barrier energies . our approximation is well justified for the reactions and energy range considered here @xcite . we assume that the sub - barrier capture mainly depends on the two - neutron transfer with positive @xmath10-value . our assumption is that , just before the projectile is captured by the target - nucleus ( just before the crossing of the coulomb barrier ) , the transfer occurs and leads to the population of the first excited collective state in the recipient nucleus @xcite . so , the motion to the @xmath62 equilibrium starts in the system before the capture because it is energetically favorable in the dinuclear system in the vicinity of the coulomb barrier . for the reactions under consideration , the average change of mass asymmetry is connected to the two - neutron transfer . since after the transfer the mass numbers , the isotopic composition and the deformation parameters of the interacting nuclei , and , correspondingly , the height @xmath63 and shape of the coulomb barrier are changed , one can expect an enhancement or suppression of the capture . if after the neutron transfer the deformations of the interacting nuclei increase ( decrease ) , the capture probability increases ( decreases ) . when the isotopic dependence of the nucleus - nucleus potential is weak and after the transfer the deformations of the interacting nuclei do not change , there is no effect of the neutron transfer on the capture . in comparison with ref . @xcite , we assume that the negative transfer @xmath64values do not play a visible role in the capture process . our scenario was verified in the description of many reactions @xcite . the primary neutron - rich products of the complete fusion reactions @xmath25xe+@xmath1ca of interest are excited and transformed into the secondary products with a smaller number of neutrons . since neutron emission is the dominant deexcitation channel in the neutron - rich isotopes of interest , the production cross sections of the secondary nuclei are the same as those of the corresponding primary nuclei . this seems to be evident without special statistical treatment . the calculations are performed by employing the predicted values of the mass excesses and the neutron separation energies @xmath65 for unknown nuclei from the finite range liquid drop model @xcite . to analyze the isotopic trend of the fusion cross section , it is useful to use the so called universal fusion function ( uff ) representation @xcite . the advantage of this representation appears clearly when one wants to compare fusion cross sections for systems with different coulomb barrier heights and positions . in the reactions where the capture and fusion cross sections coincide , the elimination of the influence of the nucleus - nucleus potential on the fusion cross section with the uff representation allows us to conclude about the role of deformation of the colliding nuclei and the nucleon transfer between interacting nuclei in the capture and fusion . on @xmath66 for the indicated reactions . ]     on @xmath67 for the reactions @xmath25xe+@xmath1ca at fixed bombarding energies @xmath68 mev ( triangles ) , @xmath69 ( stars ) , @xmath70 mev ( circles ) . ]    in ref . @xcite the reduction procedure consists of the following transformations : @xmath71 the frequency @xmath72 is related with the second derivative @xmath73 of the nucleus - nucleus potential @xmath26 at the barrier radius @xmath74 and the reduced mass parameter @xmath17 . with these replacements one can compare the cross sections for different reactions .     for the indicated neutron - rich isotopes @xmath75w produced in the @xmath22xe+@xmath1ca reaction . the vertical dashed lines show the range of energies for the production of given isotope . ]     for the indicated neutron - rich isotopes @xmath76w produced in the @xmath77xe+@xmath1ca reaction . the vertical dashed lines show the range of energies for the production of given isotope . ]    in fig .  1 , one can see the comparison of the calculated functions @xmath78 for the reactions @xmath79xe+@xmath1ca with stable and radioactive beams . as expected , at sub - barrier energies the enhancement of the complete fusion ( capture ) cross section is larger in the case of reactions with strongly quadrupole deformed projectile - nuclei and after neutron transfer . the quadrupole deformation parameter @xmath29 of the projectile nucleus increases with changing mass number from @xmath67=136 to @xmath67=130 or to @xmath67=144 . for the reaction @xmath30xe+@xmath1ca with spherical target and projectile and without neutron transfer the cross section is the smallest one at @xmath80 . the sub - barrier cross sections for the reactions @xmath9xe+@xmath1ca with neutron transfer ( positive @xmath10-values ) are larger than those for the reactions @xmath8xe+@xmath1ca , where the neutron transfer is suppressed ( negative @xmath10-values ) . since after two - neutron transfer the mass numbers and the deformation parameters of the interacting nuclei are changed and the height of the coulomb barrier decreases , one can expect an enhancement of the capture . for example , after the neutron transfer in the reaction @xmath81xe(@xmath82)+@xmath1ca(@xmath31)@xmath83xe(@xmath84)+@xmath85ca(@xmath86 ) , the deformation of the target - nucleus increases and the mass asymmetry of the system decreases , and , thus , the value of the coulomb barrier decreases and the capture cross section becomes larger ( fig .  1 ) . we observe the same behavior in the reactions with the projectiles @xmath87xe . the complete fusion ( capture ) cross sections for the reactions @xmath0xe+@xmath1ca at different bombarding energies are presented in fig .  2 . the behaviour of the curves in fig .  2 is determined by the quadrupole deformation and neutron transfer effects . the isotopic dependency is rather weak at energies above the corresponding coulomb barriers . at sub - barrier energies the fusion cross section decreases by about one order of magnitude with increasing mass number @xmath67 of the projectile from @xmath88 up to @xmath89 ( @xmath90 ) . for @xmath91 a steep increase can be observed for beam energies of 5 mev below the corresponding coulomb barriers . at energies near the coulomb barrier the cross section changes in a similar way but the curve shows a much flatter slope .     for the indicated neutron - deficient isotopes of rn produced in the @xmath92-channels ( @xmath93=2 - 4 ) of the @xmath94cs+@xmath24ga reaction . ]    cs+@xmath24ga reaction . ]    in figs .  3 and 4 we present the possibilities for future experiments to produce the neutron - rich isotopes @xmath2w in complete fusion reactions of @xmath11xe+@xmath1ca with radioactive beams . the production cross sections of the neutron - rich @xmath95w isotopes , for example , are between the 10 @xmath17b and 100 mb levels meaning that they can be observed with rather low beam intensities and with the present experimental techniques . the calculated cross sections are more than two orders of magnitude larger than in fragmentation reactions @xcite . note also , that when the neutron number approaches the drip - line the production cross section in complete fusion decreases not so fast as in fragmentation reactions . the availability of heavy radioactive beams at coulomb barrier energies at future facilities like fair , hie - isolde or spiral - ii will enable the experimental utilization of the above discussed effects for fusion reactions . another competing method to produce heavy exotic isotopes is projectile fragmentation at relativistic energies which is for example used at the fragment separator ( frs ) at gsi . in the following , we give some comparative considerations on both methods since , depending on the region of the nuclear chart , fragmentation can lead to high yields of exotic nuclei . as an example , we consider the isotope @xmath96w . cross - sections of up to about 2 mb are predicted for its production in the complete fusion reactions of @xmath22xe+@xmath1ca at e@xmath97 mev . cross - sections on the same order are also measured in the fragmentation reactions leading to yields of @xmath98 ions / s . at the future super - frs facility even yields of @xmath99 ions / s are predicted . in order to obtain at least the same yields of @xmath98 ions / s in fusion reactions , @xmath22xe beams with intensities of at least @xmath100 ions / s are required . the largest intensities for neutron - rich xe beams are expected at spiral - ii where @xmath101 of @xmath22xe projectiles per second are predicted which is , however , still eight orders of magnitude less than needed for an efficient application of fusion reactions to reach @xmath96w .    as an other example , we discuss in the following the synthesis of neutron deficient rn ( @xmath102 ) isotopes in the complete fusion reactions . figures 5 and 6 show the calculated excitation functions for fusion reactions of @xmath103cs beams with @xmath24ga target . the survival probabilities of the excited compound nuclei in the neutron evaporation channels @xmath92 ( @xmath104 ) are calculated by employing the modified statistical code grogif @xcite with the same parameters as in ref . the capture cross sections and fusion probabilities are calculated with the quantum diffusion approach @xcite and the dinuclear system fusion model @xcite , respectively . radioactive cs beams are already now available with high intensities for a broad variety of isotopes and are therefore favourable projectiles . at rex - isolde for example , the isotopes @xmath105cs are provided with intensities around @xmath106 ions / s and for the future hie - isolde facility ten times higher intensities are expected at beam energies of @xmath21 5.5 mev / nucleon . a comparison of the predicted yields for neutron deficient rn isotopes at the superfrs facility with the expected yields from fusion evaporation reactions with @xmath23cs beams at intensities of @xmath106 ions / s leads to the conclusion that the complete fusion is not superior to fragmentation for @xmath25rn isotopes with @xmath107 . for these mass numbers at least 2 - 7 times lower yields can be obtained in the fusion reactions with the presently available beam intensities . because of deformation and neutron transfer effects , a strong dependence of the sub - barrier complete fusion ( capture ) cross section on the isospin was found for the reactions @xmath0xe+@xmath1ca . at fixed bombarding energy , the cross section increases with changing mass number of the projectile - nucleus from @xmath67=136 to @xmath67=130 or to @xmath67=150 . the @xmath30xe+@xmath1ca reaction with magic and semimagic nuclei has the smallest cross section . the complete fusion ( capture ) cross sections for the reactions @xmath8xe+@xmath1ca without neutron transfer are smaller than those for the reactions @xmath9xe+@xmath1ca with neutron transfer . we demonstrated the possibilities for producing neutron - rich isotopes of @xmath2w with relatively large cross sections for future experiments in the complete fusion reactions @xmath11xe+@xmath1ca with radioactive beams . however , we found that for the production of neutron - rich w the fragmentation reactions are more preferable than the complete fusion reactions . even if we consider here the formation of neutron - rich w isotopes as an example , our findings have general validity and are not restricted to specific isotopes . exotic nuclei with large deformations which could be used as projectiles can equally be found in wide regions on the neutron - rich as well as on the neutron - deficient side of the nuclear chart . we concluded also that the complete fusion @xmath23cs+@xmath24ga reaction with radioactive beam @xmath23cs is not superior to fragmentation for the production of neutron - deficient isotopes of @xmath108rn . the fragmentation reactions result in slightly larger yields of these isotopes . note that the choice of the method of production of the isotopes near the drip lines would be also affected by the purposes of the experiments and the available facilities . 99 w.  loveland , phys . c * 76 * , 014612 ( 2007 ) ; _ ibid _ * 75 * , 069801 ( 2007 ) . haustein , e.m . franz , s.  katcoff , n.a . morcos , h.a . smith , jr . , and t.e . ward , phys . c * 14 * , 645 ( 1976 ) . j. benlliure , k .- h . schmidt , d.  cortina -

"mixtures of @xmath0he and @xmath1he atoms exhibit a rich phase diagram , where besides a normal phase , there is a phase where @xmath1he is superfluid , and a phase separated region of superfluid @xmath1he and normal @xmath0he.@xcite in 1971 , blume , emery and griffiths@xcite proposed a model to describe such mixtures . they simplified the continuous phase of the superfluid order parameter such that it could acquire only two values . although they made this very rough approximation and modelled the uniform system in a lattice , their results are very interesting . qualitatively , they reproduced the right phases and the right orders of the phase transitions . furthermore , if disorder is introduced by placing the mixture into aerogel , after some modifications,@xcite the model can still yield the experimentally observed phase diagram.@xcite    here , we generalize this model to a two - component case in order to describe systems with two order parameters and study the problem numerically , using monte carlo simulations . the motivation for the model we are proposing is twofold . firstly , we would like to study condensed matter materials like heavy fermions , high-@xmath2 superconductors , and organic superconductors . in particular , we want to study the interplay between magnetic and superconducting ordering in these materials . both order parameters are modelled as an ising spin variable . concerning the magnetism , we consider the ferro- and the antiferro - magnetic cases , and investigate also the effect of an additional magnetic field . we find that in the absence of a magnetic field , in the region where the two orders coexist , the system is always phase separated . when we add a magnetic field , we also find regions with microscopic coexistence of the two phases . secondly , we want to study mixtures of cold atoms . cold atoms have emerged in recent years as an ideal simulator of condensed matter systems . because experiments with cold atoms are often carried out in a trap , we add a trapping potential to the model . this fact qualitatively changes the physics of the problem . for the case of a single component beg model in a trap , the results are compared with experimental and theoretical work on imbalanced fermi mixtures . for the case of the two - component beg model , we make predictions for the phase diagram of boson - boson mixtures . the outline of this paper is the following : in section  [ sec : twobeg ] , we introduce the two - component beg model , and investigate it in the presence and absence of an external magnetic field . the effect of a trapping potential is described in section  [ sec : trap ] . in section  [ sec : comp ] , we compare the results with magnetic superconductors and cold atom systems . our conclusions are presented in section  [ sec : conc ] . the beg model was originally proposed to describe superfluidity.@xcite the phase diagram found by monte carlo simulations exhibits large similarities with the phase diagram of @xmath0he-@xmath1he mixtures measured by experimentalists.@xcite the main idea of studying superfluidity with the beg model relies on the @xmath3 symmetry - breaking of the ground - state wave function . for superconductivity and bose - einstein condensation we have the same symmetry breaking , hence we can try to model these phenomena in the same way . several physical systems exhibit two unequal symmetry broken phases simultaneously . a general hamiltonian describing this class of systems reads    @xmath4    where @xmath5 can take the values @xmath6 , and @xmath7 . this choice implies that only one kind of boson can occupy each lattice site . @xmath8 is an anisotropy field that controls the number of lattice sites with nonzero @xmath9 . @xmath10 plays the role of an external magnetic field , which may couple only to the order parameter describing a magnetic transition . the hamiltonian is appropriate for describing phase transitions which require two order parameters , one describing the ordering of the fraction of the system with nonzero @xmath11 , the other one of nonzero @xmath12 . this yields several possibilities , both fractions can model superfluidity , superconductivity , or ( anti)ferromagnetism . possible applications could be magnetic superconductors , or two - component bose - einstein condensates .    from now on , we will consider the fraction with nonnegative @xmath11 as describing magnetism , and @xmath12 superconductivity ( preformed bosons that can bose - einstein condensate ) . thus , @xmath9 represents the spin of particle @xmath13 and @xmath14 the discretized phase of the wavefunction . therefore , @xmath15 can be both positive ( ferromagnetism ) and negative ( antiferromagnetism ) , but @xmath16 has to be positive . we define the concentration , the ferromagnetic , antiferromagnetic , and superconducting order parameters as @xmath17 note that @xmath18 and @xmath19 can reach a maximum value of @xmath20 , and @xmath21 of @xmath22 . we define the ratio between the two coupling constants @xmath16 and @xmath15 as @xmath23      we investigate this model by monte carlo simulations . to determine the location of second - order phase transitions , we performed simulations at constant concentration , in which the elementary moves were flips of @xmath14 and @xmath9 or nonlocal spin exchanges . the location of the transition is then obtained from the peak location of the magnetic susceptibility . the locations of first - order phase transitions are obtained from simulations at constant temperature , with as elementary moves local flips of @xmath14 and @xmath9 , as well as same - site replacements of @xmath14 by @xmath9 and vice versa . a jump in the concentration @xmath20 as a function of the anisotropy field @xmath8 is then the signature of the phase transition . all simulations are performed on lattices with approximately @xmath24 sites . per point in the phase diagram , simulations were run over @xmath25 to @xmath26 monte carlo steps per site , depending on the correlation times .      in the absence of a magnetic field , the hamiltonian has ferro - antiferromagnetic symmetry . first , we consider @xmath28 . in this case , @xmath29 , and the shape of the phase diagram must be symmetric under the transformation @xmath30 . the results of the simulations are plotted in fig . [ figure : h0k1 ] . we see that it indeed obeys this symmetry and exhibits four phases : a superconducting phase ( s ) , where the order parameter @xmath21 is nonzero , a ferromagnetic phase ( fm ) , where @xmath18 is nonzero , a phase - separated regime ( ps ) where the spins and the angular phases have formed ordered clusters , and finally the normal phase ( n ) , in which there is neither order nor phase separation . analogous to the beg model , the transition from the phase - separated regions to other phases are first - order ( dashed line ) , the other ones are second - order ( continuous line ) . second , we consider the case @xmath31 . the results of the simulations are plotted in fig . [ figure : h0k01 ] . we can understand the results as follows : @xmath16 is much smaller than @xmath15 , hence the spins will not pay much attention to the angular phases , and the part of the phase diagram concerning the spins will be very similar to the beg model . because @xmath16 is so small , the phases will only order at very low temperatures ( at zero concentration , the temperature is ten times lower than the one at which the spins order at a concentration of one ) . if the concentration is slightly raised from zero , the system is already in the phase separated regime . all the states with a nonzero phase have clustered , and are not diluted by states with nonzero spin . therefore , the critical temperature in the phase separated region will approximately remain constant . because the temperature at which the angular phases order is lower than the temperature at which phase separation begins , there is a phase separated region in which the angular phases of the wavefunction are not ordered , which may appear unexpected at first sight . the transition within the phase separated regime , from the region where the angular phases are not ordered to the phase where they are ordered ( superconductivity ) , is second - order . this is expected , because in the phase separated regime , all the phases have clustered , and the transition will be comparable with the transition in the ising model , which is also second - order .      if we apply a nonnegative uniform magnetic field to the system , the ferro - antiferromagnetic symmetry is broken . we choose to consider the antiferromagnetic case here , because then there are two competing effects , the magnetic field tends to align the spins , whereas the exchange interaction wants to order the spins antiferromagnetically . the magnetic field @xmath10 will be measured in units of @xmath15 . kimel _ et al._@xcite have studied the antiferromagnetic beg model in the presence of a magnetic field , using monte carlo simulations . their results at zero temperature suggest that the behavior of the system should be separated into three qualitatively distinct regions , namely @xmath32 , h \in[2,4]$ ] and @xmath33 $ ] . we consider here the cases @xmath28 and @xmath31 for values of @xmath10 within each of these intervals . first , we considered a magnetic field in the interval @xmath34 $ ] , namely @xmath35 . both for @xmath28 and @xmath31 , the results ( not shown ) are qualitatively the same as in the case of @xmath27 . this behavior was expected from the phase diagram of the single - component beg model at zero temperature . because the magnetic field tries to align the spins , the antiferromagnetic transition temperature is lower than in the absence of a magnetic field .      in the usual beg model , the first - order phase transition disappears in the presence of a magnetic field @xmath36 $ ] . at zero temperature , there is a second - order phase transition between a state with @xmath37 at every site , and a checkerboard phase , where one sublattice has @xmath37 at every site , and the other one @xmath38 . there is also a transition between the checkerboard state , and an antiferromagnetic phase , but this transition is absent at nonzero temperature.@xcite    for @xmath28 , the behavior of the two - component beg model is still very similar to the case @xmath27 . for @xmath31 , the first - order phase transition disappears , and therefore there is no phase - separated region , see fig . [ figure : h25k01 ] . we do observe an antiferromagnetic and a superconducting phase , but it is not clear from the figure whether the two phases overlap . to better understand this low-@xmath39 intermediate regime , we also simulated the problem at a relative coupling strength of @xmath40 . in fig . [ figure : h25k05 ] , we clearly observe that there is a region where antiferromagnetism and superconductivity coexist , _ without true phase separation _ , since the first - order phase transition has disappeared . what is also interesting is that at zero temperature this region begins at a nonzero concentration , and ends at a concentration smaller than one . when there is phase separation , this coexistence region always begins at @xmath41 and ends at @xmath42 .      in the original beg model , when the magnetic field is increased to a value higher than @xmath43 at zero temperature , antiferromagnetism totally disappears because the spins tend to align with the magnetic field.@xcite the system is therefore magnetized , but not because of the nearest - neighbor interactions . therefore , this is not really ferromagnetism , but for the sake of simplicity , we denote it like this . for the case of @xmath28 , we observe a phase with ferromagnetic and superconducting ordering , and a ferromagnetic phase ( not shown ) . for @xmath31 , we find another interesting phase , namely a ferromagnetic checkerboard phase , consisting of two sublattices , see fig . [ figure : h5k01 ] . at the first sublattice , all sites are randomly occupied by phases with a value of @xmath44 or @xmath45 . at the second one , all sites are occupied by the spin that is favored by the magnetic field , @xmath38 . this phase is most likely to occur at a concentration of @xmath46 because in this case a perfect checkerboard is possible . because experiments with cold atoms are often carried out in a trap , we will add a harmonic potential to the original beg hamiltonian , to describe mixtures of fermions and bosons in a trap . in general , the potential felt by the bosons is different from the one felt by the fermions , what implies that we must include two terms , @xmath47 here , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the horizontal and vertical distances of site @xmath13 , measured from the center of the lattice , in lattice units , and @xmath50 and @xmath51 measure how much the bosons ( the states with @xmath52 ) , and the fermions ( the states with @xmath37 ) feel the influence of the trap . if @xmath53 , this term is constant , and the phase diagram is not modified . we will consider the case @xmath54 , which is the most relevant experimentally . using the hard core constraint @xmath55 , we can then rewrite this term and add it to the beg hamiltonian , thus obtaining @xmath56    where @xmath57 . this means that , effectively , the bosons will feel a stronger tendency to go to the center of the trap .    in the limit of @xmath58 , all the states with @xmath59 will cluster in the center of the trap , and therefore the ordering temperature will be the same as in the ising model . note that the maximum value of the extra term in the hamiltonian will depend on the size of the lattice . this way of including the trapping potential is comparable with the work of gygi _ et al._,@xcite where a spatial - dependent chemical potential was added to the bose - hubbard model in order to describe bosonic atoms in an optical lattice . we simulated the new model using the same procedures as for the beg model and the two - component beg model . the results for three different strengths of the trapping potential are plotted in fig . [ figure : trap1beg ] . in the beg model without a trap , there is a second - order phase transition from a normal state to an ordered state , and a first - order phase transition to a phase - separated region@xcite . for the three values of @xmath60 considered here , we do not find a first - order phase transition any more . a part of the first - order phase transition line disappears , and a part changes into a second - order one . we see that for a small difference between the trap potential felt by the bosons and the fermions , @xmath61 , the transition temperatures are very similar to the case without a trap . for a large difference , @xmath62 , the transition temperatures approach the transition temperature of the ising model for almost all concentrations , as expected . when the states with @xmath59 are ordered , we will not speak of a superfluid state , but of a condensed state , because we now consider bosons in general . it is important to estimate at which temperature the system starts to feel the influence of the trapping potential . let us assume that a cluster of size @xmath63 feels the potential when the energy difference between the state with this cluster in the center and in the corner of the lattice is of the order @xmath64 . for a lattice of size @xmath65 , this estimation results in @xmath66 in this approximation , a single particle ( @xmath67 ) in a lattice of size @xmath68 will start to feel the potential if @xmath69 . for @xmath62 and @xmath70 this results in @xmath71 and @xmath72 , respectively , in both cases much higher than the temperatures we are interested in , because ordering starts around @xmath73 . therefore , the single particles will experience the influence of the trap in the entire temperature range of fig . [ figure : trap1beg ] @xmath74 and @xmath75 . for @xmath61 , a single particle will feel the trapping potential for temperatures lower than @xmath76 . however , for higher temperatures the system already orders , and therefore there are some large clusters that according to eq . ( [ eq : est ] ) will feel the potential already at much higher temperatures . this reasoning is in agreement with the snapshots in fig . [ figure : trap1beg ] @xmath77 . for @xmath61 , we clearly observe the influence of the trap when the states with @xmath59 have clustered . in the disordered state , the influence is less visible . for @xmath62 and @xmath70 , we indeed see the influence of the trap for all temperatures , even in the disordered state . analogous to the previous subsection , we will also add a trapping potential to the two - component beg model . in the latter , both the states with @xmath59 and @xmath78 describe bosons , that both can condense . therefore , this model can be applied to study cold atoms mixtures with two species of bosons . we will consider the realistic case that the two species feel different trapping potentials . therefore , we add the extra terms @xmath79 to the hamiltonian . because at every lattice site @xmath55 , we can rewrite this term and add it to the two - component beg hamiltonian , to get    @xmath80    where @xmath81 is now the difference between the potentials felt by the two species of bosons . now , the bosons with @xmath59 have a stronger tendency to go to the center of the lattice . the results of our simulations are plotted in figs . [ figure : trapbeg2k01 ] and  [ figure : trapbeg2k1 ] . we considered two different strengths of the trapping potential , and two different ratios of the coupling strengths of the bosons , namely @xmath82 and @xmath31 . for @xmath31 , the right part of the first - order phase transition disappears and the left one becomes second - order ( see fig . [ figure : trapbeg2k01 ] ) , whereas for @xmath28 both left and right parts of the first - order phase transition are converted into second - order ( see fig .  [ figure : trapbeg2k1 ] ) . + in the limit of @xmath58 , all the sites with @xmath59 will have clustered in the center of the lattice , and all sites with @xmath78 at the corners . therefore , for all concentrations , the system behaves as two uncoupled ising models . in the case of @xmath28 , we see indeed that the transition temperatures for both species approach the ising transition temperature . for @xmath31 , because @xmath16 is ten times smaller than @xmath15 , one of the species will order at the ising transition temperature , and the other one at one tenth of the ising transition temperature .    to find the temperature at which the system starts to feel the presence of the trap , we can make the same analysis as in subsection  [ sec : trapbc ] . also here , we see in the snapshots of figs . [ figure : trapbeg2k01 ] and  [ figure : trapbeg2k1 ] that for @xmath83 ( not shown ) and @xmath84 , the system always feels the influence of the trap , and for @xmath85 , it does only when the system is ordered . if we inspect fig . [ figure : trapbeg2k1 ] @xmath77 , we see that there is a phase @xmath86 in which the bosons represented by @xmath78 are ordered , but the bosons represented by @xmath59 are not . this is somewhat surprising . a reason for the occurrence of this phase is that when all the bosons that have the tendency to go to the center of the trap have clustered there , automatically also the other bosons have clustered at the edge . therefore , they can have nearest - neighbor interactions , and they can easily order . it remains to see whether such a phase indeed occurs in experiments . from the theoretical point of view , it would be interesting to also allow for states with @xmath87 , to verify the stability of this phase , when we relax the constraint that every lattice site must be occupied by one of the bosons . note that for small enough concentrations , this phase will always occur , since the bosons @xmath12 are hardly diluted by the bosons @xmath11 . there are several examples of cerium - based superconductors , for example cecoin@xmath88 and ceirin@xmath88 , as well as antiferromagnets that contain this element , like cerhin@xmath88 , cecocd@xmath88 , cerhcd@xmath88 , and ceircd@xmath88 . let us consider cecoin@xmath88 and cecocd@xmath88 . these two materials have two elements in common , ce and co , and differ in the third element . by doping cecoin@xmath88 with cd on the in site , we can change the superconductor cecoin@xmath88 into an antiferromagnet . there are more of these cerium - based pairs , and therefore , this class of materials is appropriate for studying the interplay between superconductivity and magnetism . let us consider the heavy fermion superconductor cecoin@xmath88 , with cadmium doping on the in - site . this material has the highest superconducting transition temperature ( @xmath89 ) of all heavy fermions , and its electronic structure is quasi-2d.@xcite nicklas _ et al._@xcite and pham _ et al._@xcite determined the antiferromagnetic and superconducting onset temperatures of this material as a function of doping by elastic neutron scattering , specific heat , and resistivity measurements . their results are plotted in fig . [ figure : ceco ] . for experimental details we refer the reader to ref .  . the phase diagram of ceco(in@xmath90cd@xmath91)@xmath88 shows three ordered phases : a superconducting phase , a commensurate antiferromagnetic phase , and a region where superconductivity and antiferromagnetism microscopically coexist . it is interesting to observe that in this material antiferromagnetism suddenly disappears at the point where the onset temperatures for superconductivity and antiferromagnetism are equal . this feature , however , may change in the presence of an applied magnetic field . in fig . [ figure : artikel3 ] we see a schematic phase diagram of unconventional superconductors , in temperature - control parameter space . in the case of ceco(in@xmath90cd@xmath91)@xmath88 , the control parameter would be doping . another example of such a parameter is pressure . et al._@xcite determined the phase diagram of cerhin@xmath88 in temperature - pressure space with and without a magnetic field . without a magnetic field , they also found this abrupt disappearance of the incommensurate antiferromagnetic order at @xmath92 . however , when they applied a field of 33 koe , the line of the magnetic ordering temperature went smoothly down to zero at @xmath93 . such a phase diagram shows many similarities with fig . [ figure : h25k05 ] if we identify pressure with inverse concentration in our model . indeed , for an external magnetic field of @xmath94 and a relative exchange strength @xmath40 ( see fig . [ figure : h25k05 ] ) , the phase diagram shows the same three ordered phases . further , the coexisting phase is not phase separated . finally , we consider the compound ceir(in@xmath90cd@xmath91)@xmath88 , see fig . [ figure : ceir ] and ref .  . for this material , it is not clear if there is a region where superconductivity and magnetism coexist . if there is such a region , it is in a small doping interval . the phase diagram of this material strongly resembles the phase diagram of the two - component beg model with an external magnetic field of @xmath94 and a relative coupling strength of @xmath31 , see fig . [ figure : h25k01 ] . although this experiment was also carried out without an external magnetic field , we only find similarities with our model in the presence of a magnetic field .      in 2006 , two experimental groups , the group of ketterle at mit,@xcite and the group of hulet at rice university,@xcite have performed experiments with imbalanced ultracold @xmath95li atoms in a trap , and obtained contradictory results . the mit group measured a transition between a normal and a superfluid phase at a polarization of @xmath96 , whereas the group at rice university observed a transition between two superfluid phases at @xmath97 . here , @xmath98 measures the imbalance between the spin - up and the spin - down atoms , @xmath99 gubbels _ et al._@xcite have set up a theoretical model to describe these imbalanced fermi mixtures and determined a general phase diagram in temperature - polarization space that can explain the observations of both groups . the topology of their phase diagram shows large similarities with the phase diagram of the beg model . we can understand this resemblance as follows . in the beg model , the concentration @xmath20 is the fraction of lattice sites with @xmath37 , and thus the fraction of the system that can not condense . the polarization @xmath98 is a measure for the difference of the atoms in the spin - up and the spin - down state , and thus for the number of fermions that remain after the others have paired . the atoms with spin up and spin down will form pairs , and such a pair can be described as a boson . therefore , the polarization is also a measure for the fraction of the system that can not condense , and the concentration can be mapped onto the polarization . we can identify the paired atoms , the preformed bosons , with the states @xmath52 , and the remaining fermions with @xmath37 , see fig . [ figure : beg ] . the experiments with @xmath95li are carried out in a trap , and the theoretical model of gubbels _ et al . _ only includes the presence of the trap by using the local density approximation . now , we would like to compare their phase diagram with our results of the beg model with a trapping potential , in figs . [ figure : trapbeg2k01 ] and  [ figure : trapbeg2k1 ] . although in the case of imbalanced fermions the frequency @xmath100 of the optical trap felt by the pairs of fermions ( bosons ) and the remaining unpaired fermions is the same , the mass of the bosons is twice as large , and the potential constant @xmath50 is thus larger than @xmath51 . this means that the comparison must be made with the beg model in a trap . in this model , the first - order phase transition , measured by a jump in the concentration as a function of the anisotropy field @xmath8 has disappeared , thus there is no true transition to a phase - separated regime . however , if we inspect the snapshots , we see that for low enough temperatures , or large enough trapping potential , there still is a clear separation between the condensed bosons and the fermions , suggesting some kind of effective phase separation . we note that in experiments , phase separation is measured by inspecting the radii of the clouds of the atoms in the different hyperfine states , and not by a jump in some order parameter.@xcite our results thus suggest that the measured different radii are not per se an evidence of a true thermodynamic phase separation . further experiments are required to clarify this issue . although our model describes qualitatively the experimentally observed phases , it can not capture the fine details of recent experimental results . studies by shin _ et al._@xcite indicate that there is no superfluid phase , or phase - separated phase for polarizations above @xmath101 . by a quantum monte carlo approach , lobo _ et al._@xcite predict a phase transition between a normal and a superfluid state at a polarization of @xmath102 at zero temperature , and gubbels and stoof@xcite recovered this results using a wilsonian renormalization group theory . we simulated a two - component extension of the beg model without an external magnetic field and determined the phase diagram in the concentration - temperature space . in the region where magnetism and superconductivity coexist , the system is always phase separated . we added a magnetic field to our model , and considered the antiferromagnetic case . in this case , we also find phase diagrams with true coexistence of two ordered phases . these diagrams are comparable with the phase diagram of doped heavy fermions in the presence of a magnetic field .    in order to describe cold atom systems , we added a trapping potential to the beg model , and our extension of this model . the added potential changes the phase separation regime conceptually . we can not speak anymore about true phase separation , but more about a crossover to a phase separated region . we argue that the beg model with a trapping potential can be used to model imbalanced fermi mixtures . however , there are still quantitative differences with experiments , which our model is not able to cover . we also made predictions for the phase diagram of boson - boson mixtures based on our simulations of the two - component beg model with a trapping potential . although there is no available experimental data on boson - boson mixtures , we hope that our work can motivate further studies in this direction . we are grateful to k. gubbels , h. van beijeren , a. de vries and r. movshovich for fruitful discussions and to j. de graaf for technical help .","The text discusses the two-component beg model, a theoretical model used to describe superfluidity and superconductivity in mixtures of bosons and fermions.

[ cxi ] ( * ? ? ? * theorem 3.5 ) equation ( [ heun ] ) has an entire solution , if and only if @xmath45 , where @xmath44 is the function from loc . cit . , introduced in ( * ? ? ? * formula ( 31 ) , p. 337 ) ; see also formula ( [ xil ] ) in subsection 4.3 below . let @xmath45 . then the function @xmath43 from theorem [ xi=0 ] is an entire solution of equation ( [ heun ] ) : @xmath0 . conversely , let equation ( [ heun ] ) have a solution @xmath43 holomorphic at 0 . if @xmath47 , then there exists a holomorphic function @xmath48 on a neighborhood of zero satisfying the equation @xmath49 , by theorem [ xi=0 ] . this together with the uniqueness statement of theorem [ xi=0 ] implies that @xmath50 up to constant factor , hence @xmath51 . the contradiction thus obtained proves the corollary . equation ( [ heun ] ) is equivalent to the recurrence relations @xmath52 which can be written in the matrix form    @xmath53 @xmath54    [ remnoncom ] a function @xmath55 satisfies equation ( [ nonhom ] ) for some @xmath56 , if and only if its taylor coefficients @xmath57 satisfy ( [ recur ] ) , or equivalently , ( [ mat1 ] ) for @xmath58 . similarly , a function @xmath59 , @xmath60 satisfies ( [ nonhom ] ) , if and only if its coefficients satisfy ( [ recur ] ) for @xmath61 .    * of corollary [ cordon ] . * let @xmath62 be a solution of equation ( [ heun ] ) having type ( [ multi ] ) . then @xmath63 the coefficients @xmath57 satisfy ( [ recur ] ) for all @xmath64 . this together with the above remark implies that the functions @xmath26 satisfy ( [ nonhom ] ) . the corresponding expressions @xmath65 should cancel out , since @xmath43 is a solution of the homogeneous equation . this implies ( [ schivka ] ) . conversely , let @xmath26 be solutions of ( [ nonhom ] ) , and let ( [ schivka ] ) hold . then we can normalize the latter solutions by constant factors ( not both vanishing simultaneously ) so that @xmath66 . then the function @xmath43 given by ( [ defef ] ) is a solution of equation ( [ heun ] ) . this proves the corollary . as it is shown below , theorem [ noncom ] is implied by the following general theorem    [ cons ] consider recurrence relations @xmath67 in unknown sequence @xmath57 , where sequences @xmath68 numerated by @xmath69 satisfy the following conditions : @xmath70 @xmath71 then there exists a unique series @xmath72 with @xmath57 satisfying ( [ rec ] ) for @xmath73 and having positive converging radius . it converges on all of @xmath30 . theorem [ cons ] will be proved in the next section . [ run ] in the series @xmath74 from theorem [ cons ] for every @xmath75 the two neighbor coefficients @xmath57 , @xmath76 do not vanish simultaneously : hence , they present a point @xmath77 . each pair of neighbor coefficients @xmath78 determines a unique sequence satisfying ( [ rec ] ) . both statements follow from the fact that for every @xmath73 the coefficient @xmath79 is expressed as a linear combination of @xmath80 and @xmath57 by ( [ rec ] ) , since @xmath81 . hence , if some two neighbor coefficients @xmath82 vanish , then all the coefficients vanish , and the series is zero ,  a contradiction . [ conv ] let @xmath83 , then for every @xmath84 such that @xmath85 for every @xmath86 , @xmath87 there exists and unique nonzero one - sided series @xmath88 ( up to multiplicative constant ) converging on some punctured disk centered at 0 that satisfies recurrence relations ( [ recur ] ) ( or equivalently , ( [ mat1 ] ) ) for @xmath89 . similarly , for every @xmath84 such that @xmath90 there exists and unique one - sides series @xmath91 ( up to multiplicative constant ) that satisfies recurrence relations ( [ recur ] ) for @xmath92 and converges outside some disk centered at 0 . both series converge on the whole punctured complex line @xmath15 . [ exkko ] let in the conditions of theorem [ conv ] one have @xmath93 ( cf . ( [ defu ] ) ) . then its statements hold for all @xmath84 , since inequalities ( [ kko ] ) hold for all @xmath94 . otherwise , if either @xmath95 , or @xmath96 , then the statements of theorem [ conv ] @xmath97 @xmath98    theorem [ conv ] together with remark [ remnoncom ] and the first statement of example [ exkko ] imply theorem [ noncom ] . * of theorems [ conv ] and [ noncom ] . * the coefficients @xmath99 of recurrence relations ( [ recur ] ) satisfy the conditions of theorem [ cons ] for @xmath100 ( @xmath92 ) . indeed , the asymptotics ( [ condi ] ) is obvious . inequalities @xmath81 follow from ( [ kko ] ) ( respectively , ( [ kko2 ] ) ) . this together with theorem [ cons ] proves theorem [ conv ] , and hence , theorem [ noncom ] . * of theorem [ xi=0 ] . * let @xmath101 , @xmath37 . inequalities ( [ kko ] ) hold for @xmath102 . therefore , there exists a unique series @xmath103 converging on a neighborhood of the origin , whose coefficients satisfy ( [ recur ] ) for @xmath73 , and it converges on all of @xmath30 ( theorem [ conv ] ) . the system of relations ( [ recur ] ) for @xmath73 is equivalent to the statement that @xmath104 . this proves theorem [ xi=0 ] . our results are motivated by applications to the family @xmath105 of nonlinear equations , which arises in several models in physics , mechanics and geometry : in a model of the josephson junction in superconductivity ( our main motivation ) , see @xcite ; in planimeters , see @xcite . here @xmath106 is a fixed constant , and @xmath107 are the parameters . set @xmath108 the variable change @xmath109 transforms ( [ josbeg ] ) to a non - autonomous ordinary differential equation on the two - torus @xmath110 with coordinates @xmath111 : @xmath112 the graphs of its solutions are the orbits of the vector field @xmath113 on @xmath114 . the _ rotation number _ of its flow , see @xcite , is a function @xmath115 of parameters . it is given by the formula @xmath116 where @xmath117 is an arbitrary solution of equation ( [ jostor ] ) . the _ phase - lock areas _ are the level subsets of the rotation number in the @xmath107-plane with non - empty interior . they have been studied by v.m.buchstaber , o.v.karpov , s.i.tertychnyi et al , see @xcite and references therein . each phase - lock area is an infinite chain of adjacent domains separated by _ adjacency points_. the description of their coordinates as solutions of analytic functional equations was conjecturally stated by v.m.bushstaber and s.i.tertychnyi in @xcite and proved by the authors of the present paper in @xcite . namely , the family of non - linear equations was reduced in @xcite to two families of second order linear differential equations of double confluent heun type : equation ( [ heun ] ) and the equation @xmath118 the latter equation is obtained by writing equation ( [ heun ] ) in terms of the parameter @xmath119 and changing sign at @xmath120 . in the case , when @xmath121 , buchstaber and tertychnyi have shown that the adjacencies correspond exactly to those parameter values , for which equation ( [ heun ] ) has a non - trivial holomorphic solution at 0 ( which is automatically an entire solution : holomorphic on @xmath30 ) ; see the statement in ( * ? ? ? * , paragraph 2 ) and the proof in ( * ? ? ? * theorem 3.3 and subsection 3.2 ) . they have explicitly constructed a family of holomorphic solutions for parameters satisfying an explicit functional equation @xmath122 , see corollary [ cxi ] . they have conjectured that the latter functional equation describes the adjacencies completely . they have reduced this conjecture to another one saying that if equation ( [ heun2 * ] ) has a polynomial solution , then equation ( [ heun ] ) does not have an entire solution . later they have reduced their second conjecture on polynomial solutions to the third one saying that appropriate determinants formed by modified bessel functions of the first type do not vanish on the positive semiaxis . the latter conjecture together with the other ones were proved in @xcite . the above - mentioned conjecture of buchstaber and tertychnyi on functional equation describing the adjacencies follows from corollary [ cxi ] and their correspondence to entire solutions of heun equations . v.m.buchstaber and s.i.tertychnyi have constructed symmetries of double confluent heun equation ( [ heun ] ) @xcite . the symmetry @xmath123 , which is an involution of its solution space , was constructed in @xcite . it corresponds to the symmetry @xmath124 of the nonlinear equation ( [ josbeg ] ) ; the latter symmetry was found in @xcite . in @xcite they have found new nontrivial symmetries in the case , when @xmath125 and equation ( [ heun2 * ] ) does not have polynomial solutions .    everywhere in the paper by _ solution @xmath126 ( or @xmath127 ) of linear recurrence relation @xmath128 we mean a ( one- or two - sided ) sequence of complex numbers @xmath57 satisfying the relation for all @xmath100 ( respectively , @xmath92 ) . ( here one may have two - sided infinite sequences . ) if in addition , the power series @xmath74 converges on some annulus centered at 0 ( for all the relations under consideration , this would automatically imply convergence on all of @xmath15 ) then the formal solution under question is called simply _ a solution _ : the adjective `` converging '' is omitted for simplicity .    in section 3 we write down explicit formulas for solutions of recurrence relations ( [ recur ] ) using the proof of theorem [ cons ] . then in section 4 we deduce explicit functional equations satisfied by monodromy eigenvalues of double confluent heun equations ( explicit versions of corollary [ cordon ] ) .    in section 5 we apply results of sections 3 and 4 to phase - lock areas in the model of josephson effect . it is known that the ratio of the monodromy eigenvalues of equation ( [ heun ] ) equals @xmath129 and their product equals @xmath130 . this together with results of section 4 implies an explicit functional equation satisfied by non - integer level curves of the rotation number as a function of parameters ( theorem [ rhonon ] in subsection 5.1 ) . the union of boundaries of the phase - lock areas coincides with the set where the monodromy has multiple eigenvalue and is described by the condition that the monodromy of equation ( [ heun ] ) has eigenvalue @xmath131 . this together with results of sections 3 , 4 implies an explicit description of the boundaries ( corollary [ cboun ] in subsection 5.2 ) . open problems on phase - lock areas and possible approaches to some of them using the above description of boundaries are discussed in subsections 5.5 and 5.6 . the following new result will be also proved in section 5 using results of section 4 . [ poteig0 ] let @xmath132 , @xmath133 , @xmath134 , @xmath135 , @xmath136 , @xmath137 , @xmath138 . the double confluent heun equation ( [ heun2 * ] ) corresponding to the latter @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath120 has a polynomial solution , if and only if @xmath139 , @xmath140 and @xmath141 , and in addition , the point @xmath107 lies in the boundary of the phase - lock area number @xmath142 and is not an adjacency . in other terms , the points @xmath143 corresponding to equations ( [ heun2 * ] ) with polynomial solutions lie in boundaries of phase - lock areas and are exactly their intersection points with the lines @xmath144 , @xmath141 , except for the adjacencies . v.m.buchstaber and s.i.tertychnyi have shown in @xcite that if a point @xmath143 corresponds to equation ( [ heun2 * ] ) with a polynomial solution , then @xmath120 , @xmath142 are integers , @xmath141 and @xmath140 . for every initial condition @xmath145 there exists a unique sequence @xmath146 satisfying recurrence relations ( [ rec ] ) , by remark [ run ] . but in general , the series @xmath147 may diverge . we have to prove that it converges for appropriately chosen unknown initial condition . to do this , we use the following trick : we run the recursion in the opposite direction , `` from infinity to zero '' . that is , take a big @xmath64 and a given `` final condition '' @xmath148 . then the inverse recursion gives all @xmath149 , @xmath150 . it appears that the initial condition @xmath145 we are looking for can be obtained as a limit of the initial conditions @xmath151 obtained by the above inverse recursion ( after rescaling ) , as @xmath152 ; the only condition on @xmath153 is that its projectivization @xmath154=(a_k : a_{k+1})\in\cp^1 $ ] should avoid some small explicitly specified `` bad region '' , which contracts to the point @xmath155 , as @xmath152 . the projectivized inverse recursion @xmath156=(a_{k}:a_{k+1})\mapsto [ q_{k-1}]=(a_{k-1}:a_k)\ ] ] defined by ( [ rec ] ) can be considered as the dynamical system @xmath157 where for every @xmath158 and @xmath159 one has @xmath160 it appears that for every @xmath64 large enough @xmath161 has a strongly attracting fixed point tending to @xmath162 and a strongly repelling fixed point tending to @xmath155 , as @xmath152 . this together with the ideas from basic theory of hyperbolic dynamics implies that the fixed point @xmath163 of the transformation @xmath164 should have a unique unstable manifold : an invariant sequence @xmath165)$ ] converging to @xmath166 . we show that a solution @xmath167 of recurrence relations ( [ rec ] ) gives a converging taylor series @xmath74 on some neighborhood of zero , if and only if @xmath168 $ ] for all @xmath64 , and then the series converge everywhere . this will prove theorem [ cons ] . the existence and uniqueness of the above - mentioned unstable manifold is implied by the following discrete analogue of the classical hadamard perron theorem on the unstable manifold of a dynamical system at a hyperbolic fixed point . [ metric ] let @xmath169 be a sequence of complete metric spaces with uniformly bounded diameters . for brevity , the distance on each of them will be denoted @xmath170 . let @xmath171 be a sequence of uniformly contracting mappings : there exists a @xmath7 , @xmath172 such that @xmath173 for every @xmath174 and @xmath58 . then there exists a unique sequence of points @xmath175 such that @xmath176 for all @xmath58 . one has @xmath177 and the convergence is uniform in @xmath178 : for every @xmath179 there exists some @xmath180 such that for every @xmath181 and every @xmath182 one has @xmath183 . if in addition the spaces @xmath184 coincide with one and the same space @xmath43 and the fixed points of the mappings @xmath161 tend to some @xmath185 , as @xmath152 , then @xmath186    the proof repeats the argument of the classical proof of hadamard  perron theorem . consider the space @xmath187 of all sequences @xmath188 , @xmath189 , equipped with the distance @xmath190 the transformation @xmath191 is a contraction . therefore , it has a unique fixed point , which is exactly the sequence we are looking for . the second statement of the theorem on the uniform convergence of compositions to @xmath192 follows from the uniform convergence of iterations of the contracting map @xmath164 to its fixed point . in the last condition of theorem [ metric ] statement ( [ limxk ] ) follows by the above fixed point argument in the subspace in @xmath187 of the sequences @xmath193 tending to @xmath194 , as @xmath152 : this is a complete @xmath164-invariant metric subspace in @xmath187 , and hence , @xmath164 has a fixed point there , which coincides with the previous sequence @xmath193 by uniqueness . theorem [ metric ] is proved . recurrence relations ( [ rec ] ) can be written in the matrix form @xmath195 consider the inverse matrices @xmath196 and their projectivizations @xmath197 acting on the projective line @xmath198 with homogeneous coordinates @xmath199 . let us introduce the affine coordinate @xmath200 on it . for every @xmath201 we denote @xmath202    [ pkconv ] the transformations @xmath161 converge to @xmath203 uniformly on every closed disk @xmath204 , @xmath201 , as @xmath152 . their inverses converge to @xmath205 uniformly on the complement of every disk @xmath206 . the image of a vector @xmath207 with @xmath208 under the matrix @xmath209 is the vector @xmath210 recall that @xmath211 , see ( [ condi ] ) , hence , @xmath212 for all @xmath64 large enough . the latter asymptotics and formula together imply that @xmath213 uniformly on @xmath204 and prove the first statement of the proposition . let us prove its second statement . for every fixed @xmath201 and every @xmath64 large enough ( dependently on @xmath214 ) one has @xmath215 , by the first statement of the proposition . the image of a vector @xmath207 under the matrix @xmath216 is @xmath217 . this together with ( [ condi ] ) implies that @xmath218 uniformly on @xmath219 , as @xmath152 ; or equivalently , @xmath220 uniformly on @xmath221 . the proposition is proved . * of theorem [ cons ] . * let @xmath222 , @xmath223 denote the closed disk @xmath224 equipped with the euclidean distance . there exist a @xmath172 and a @xmath225 such that for every @xmath226 one has @xmath227 and the mapping @xmath228 is a @xmath7-contraction : @xmath229 . this follows from the first statement of the proposition and schwarz lemma . the fixed point of the mapping @xmath161 tends to 0 , as @xmath152 , by uniform convergence ( proposition [ pkconv ] ) . this together with theorem [ metric ] implies that there exists a unique sequence @xmath230 such that @xmath231 for all @xmath226 and @xmath232 . the latter sequence corresponds to a unique sequence @xmath233 ( up to multiplicative constant ) such that @xmath234 ; one has @xmath235 for every @xmath236 . the sequence @xmath167 satisfies relations ( [ rec ] ) for @xmath226 , which are equivalent to the equalities @xmath231 . it extends to a unique sequence @xmath146 satisfying ( [ rec ] ) for @xmath73 , as in remark [ run ] . in addition , @xmath237 , i.e. , @xmath238 , as @xmath239 , by ( [ limxk ] ) and since the attracting fixed points of the mappings @xmath161 converge to 0 , by proposition [ pkconv ] . therefore , the series @xmath240 converges on the whole complex line @xmath30 . the existence is proved . now let us prove the uniqueness . let , by contradiction , there exist a series @xmath241 satisfying relations ( [ rec ] ) , having a positive convergence radius and not coinciding with the one constructed above . then there exists a @xmath226 such that @xmath242 , i.e. , @xmath243 . for every @xmath244 one has @xmath245 , that is , @xmath246 , as @xmath247 , by the second statement of proposition [ pkconv ] . hence the series diverges everywhere : has zero convergence radius . the contradiction thus obtained proves theorem [ cons ] . here we present explicit formulas for the unique converging series from theorem [ conv ] solving recurrence relations ( [ recur ] ) . first in subsection 3.1 we provide a general method for writing them , which essentially repeats and slightly generalizes the method from ( * ? ? ? * , pp . 337338 ) . then we write them for @xmath248 , and afterwards for @xmath249 .      here we consider a solution of general recurrence relations ( [ rec ] ) from theorem [ cons ] . let @xmath250 , @xmath251 , @xmath252 be the coefficients in ( [ rec ] ) . let @xmath197 be the projectivizations of the transformations @xmath209 , see ( [ lak ] ) . let @xmath74 be a solution to ( [ rec ] ) . recall that we denote @xmath253 , in the standard coordinate @xmath254 on @xmath255 one has @xmath256 . we have @xmath176 , and for every @xmath64 the infinite product @xmath257 converges to @xmath192 . more precisely , @xmath258 , as @xmath259 uniformly on compact subsets in @xmath260 , as in the proof of theorem [ cons ] . one can then deduce that there exists a number sequence @xmath261 such that for every @xmath64 the infinite matrix product @xmath262 converges to a rank 1 matrix @xmath263 such that @xmath264 this would be an explicit formula for the solution @xmath74 . however the infinite product of the matrices @xmath209 themselves diverges , since their terms @xmath265 tend to infinity : one has to find a priori unknown normalizing constants @xmath261 . to construct a converging matrix product explicitly , we will consider a rescaled sequence @xmath57 , that is @xmath266 rewriting relations ( [ rec ] ) in terms of the new sequence @xmath267 yields @xmath268 @xmath269 the matrices @xmath270 converge to the projector @xmath271 our goal is to choose the above rescaling so that the infinite products @xmath272 converge : then the limit is a one - dimensional operator @xmath273 with @xmath274 being generated by the vector @xmath275 . it appears that one can achieve the latter convergence by appropriate choice of normalizing constants @xmath153 . we use the following sufficient conditions of convergence of products of almost projectors @xmath270 .

[ monprod ] the determinant of the monodromy operator of heun equation ( [ heun ] ) equals @xmath450 . the monodromy matrix is the product of the formal monodromy matrix @xmath451 and a pair of unipotent matrices : the inverse to the stokes matrices , cf . * formulas ( 2.15 ) and ( 3.2 ) ) . therefore , its determinant equals @xmath450 . another possible proof would be to use the formula for wronskian of two linearly independent solutions of equation ( [ heun ] ) from ( * ? ? ? * , proof of theorem 4 ) . it shows that the wronskian equals @xmath452 times a function holomorphic on @xmath15 , and hence , it gets multiplied by @xmath453 after analytic continuation along a positive circuit around zero . recall ( * ? ? ? * , lemma 1 ) that the transformation @xmath454 : @xmath455 is an involution acting on the space of solutions of equation ( [ heun ] ) . [ propdiez ] let the monodromy operator of heun equation have distinct eigenvalues . then the involution @xmath456 permutes the corresponding eigenfunctions . the involution under question is a composition of transformation of a function to its linear combination with its derivative , the variable change @xmath457 and multiplication by @xmath452 . let now @xmath43 be a monodromy eigenfunction with eigenvalue @xmath458 . the composition of the first and second operations transforms @xmath43 to a function whose monodromy extension along positive circuit around the origin multiplies it by @xmath459 : the second operation inverses the direction of the circuit . the multiplication by @xmath452 multiplies the above result of analytic extension by @xmath450 . therefore , @xmath460 is a monodromy eigenfunction with the eigenvalue @xmath461 . it coincides with the second monodromy eigenvalue , since it is found by the condition that @xmath462 , see proposition [ monprod ] . this proves the proposition . in this case the denominators in formulas ( [ mat3 ] ) and ( [ defsm ] ) for the matrices @xmath270 and @xmath401 respectively are nonzero for all integer @xmath64 and @xmath388 , and hence , the matrices are well - defined together with the infinite products @xmath280 , @xmath463 .    [ eight ] let @xmath352 . equation ( [ heun ] ) has a monodromy eigenfunction with eigenvalue @xmath19 , @xmath5 , if and only if @xmath464    let @xmath55 be a converging series satisfying ( [ recur ] ) for @xmath58 . recall that @xmath465 set @xmath466 the sequence @xmath446 satisfies ( [ recur ] ) for @xmath73 , by theorem [ th24 ] . recall that @xmath467 set @xmath468 the sequence @xmath469 satisfies ( [ recur ] ) for all @xmath470 , by theorem [ conv- ] . substituting the above formulas for @xmath424 , @xmath471 , @xmath428 , @xmath472 to pasting equation ( [ aoal ] ) yields ( [ paste ] ) . the theorem is proved . note that in the case under consideration one has @xmath473 .

[ pjcell ] a point in the parameter space of equation ( [ jos ] ) lies in the boundary of a phase - lock area , if and only if the monodromy of the corresponding heun equation ( [ heun ] ) is parabolic : has multiple eigenvalue . the point under question lyes in the boundary of a phase - lock area , if and only if the flow mapping of the vector field ( [ josvect ] ) for the period @xmath559 ( restricted to the coordinate @xmath620-circle ) is parabolic : has a fixed point with unit derivative . the period mapping is the restriction to the unit circle of the monodromy of the corresponding riccati equation : the projectivized monodromy . parabolicity of the projectivization of a two - dimensional linear operator is equivalent to its own parabolicity . the proposition is proved . the monodromy matrix is the product of the formal monodromy matrix @xmath451 and a pair of unipotent matrices : the inverse to the stokes matrices at 0 , cf . * formulas ( 2.15 ) and ( 3.2 ) ) . therefore , if the monodromy of a heun equation ( [ heun ] ) is a multiplication by scalar number , then the stokes matrices are trivial , and the monodromy coincides with the formal one . hence , both monodromies are scalar and given by the above diagonal matrix with unit eigenvalue . thus , they are trivial . the proposition is proved .    the condition saying that the monodromy has multiple eigenvalue is equivalent to the statement that it has eigenvalue @xmath621 , by proposition [ monprod ] . this is equivalent to the statement that there exists a multivalued solution @xmath622 of heun equation with @xmath623 : a monodromy eigenfunction with the above eigenvalue . heun equations ( [ heun ] ) satisfying the latter statement will be described below by using the following proposition . afterwards we deduce immediately the description of boundaries of phase - lock areas . the proposition follows from the fact that the involution @xmath456 sends monodromy eigenfunctions to eigenfunctions ( proposition [ propdiez ] ) . * case 1 : @xmath625 , @xmath626 : the monodromy eigenvalue equals @xmath627 . * then the monodromy operator of heun equation ( [ heun ] ) is a jordan cell , by proposition [ pjcell2 ] . consider the matrices @xmath628      the corresponding eigenfunction @xmath43 has the form @xmath632 equation ( [ heun ] ) is equivalent to recurrence equations ( [ recur ] ) with @xmath626 : @xmath633 the series @xmath14 should converge on @xmath15 . the above matrices @xmath270 and @xmath273 coincide with those constructed in ( [ mat3 ] ) , and they are well - defined for all @xmath94 . therefore , the coefficients @xmath57 , @xmath75 are given by formulas ( [ ak ] ) up to common constant factor , by theorem [ conv ] : @xmath634    now we will use the condition of ( anti- ) invariance @xmath635 ( proposition [ dinvar ] ) , which takes the form @xmath636 or equivalently , @xmath637 the free ( zero power ) term of the latter equation is equivalent to the relation @xmath638 which is in its turn equivalent to ( [ r0eql ] ) , by ( [ a011 ] ) . therefore , existence of the above solution @xmath43 implies ( [ r0eql ] ) . let us prove the converse : each equation ( [ r0eql ] ) implies the existence of a solution ( [ eheun ] ) of heun equation . to do this , consider the action of the transformation @xmath456 on the _ formal _ series ( [ eheun ] ) ( with @xmath16 not necessarily converging ) . it sends formal solutions of heun equation ( equivalently , formal solutions of ( [ l2 ] ) ) to formal solutions . ( the proof of symmetry of heun equation under the transformation @xmath456 uses only leibniz differentiation rule and remains valid for formal series . ) the space of formal solutions is two - dimensional , and it is identified with the space of its initial conditions @xmath639 . the transformation @xmath456 is its involution . its eigenvalues are equal to @xmath640 , and the corresponding eigenspaces are defined by initial conditions that satisfy ( [ eql ] ) . therefore , both eigenspaces are one - dimensional and are exactly characterized by equations ( [ eql ] ) , since both equations ( [ eql ] ) are nontrivial . thus , _ a formal solution @xmath439 of recurrence relations ( [ l2 ] ) is @xmath456-(anti)-invariant , if and only if its coefficients @xmath427 , @xmath428 satisfy ( [ eql ] ) with the corresponding sign . _ fix the one - sided solution @xmath641 of recurrence relations ( [ l2 ] ) for @xmath75 . it satisfies ( [ eql ] ) , by ( [ r0eql ] ) . the sequence @xmath642 extends uniquely to a two - sided formal solution @xmath439 of ( [ l2 ] ) ( a priori , not necessarily presenting a converging series for @xmath249 ) , since the coefficients at @xmath79 in ( [ l2 ] ) do not vanish . the latter formal solution should be @xmath456-(anti-)invariant , by ( [ eql ] ) and the previous statement . hence , @xmath643 by ( [ dinv ] ) . the series @xmath644 converges on @xmath15 : it is bounded from above by converging series @xmath645 , by the latter formula . this together with the above argument proves the theorem . we are looking for a double - infinite solution @xmath652 of heun equation ( [ heun ] ) with @xmath16 holomorphic on @xmath15 . that is , with @xmath57 satisfying recurrence relations ( [ recur ] ) for @xmath647 , which take the form @xmath653 the above matrices @xmath270 and @xmath273 coincide with those constructed in ( [ mat3 ] ) , and they are well - defined for all @xmath94 . therefore , the coefficients @xmath57 , @xmath75 are given by formulas ( [ ak ] ) up to common constant factor , by theorem [ conv ] . in particular , @xmath654 the condition of ( anti- ) invariance under the involution @xmath456 of the solution takes the form @xmath655 or equivalently , @xmath656 the free term ( zero power term ) of the latter equation is @xmath657 which is equivalent to ( [ r1eql ] ) . the rest of proof of theorem [ heun5 ] is analogous to the proof of theorem [ heun4 ] .

"( heron formula ) let @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 be the lengths of the sides of a triangle , @xmath3 the half of the perimeter and @xmath4 the area . then holds @xmath5 @xmath6    now we define : a _ heron triangle _ is a triangle with integer sides and area . [ prop : peri ] the perimeter of a heron triangle is even . assume the perimeter is odd . then all factors on the right hand side of equation ( [ eq : heron ] ) are halves of odd integers , so the product is an odd integer divided by @xmath7 , which can not be an integer . @xmath6    if the sides of a heron triangle have a common factor @xmath8 , then the area is divisible by @xmath9 , i.e. the triangle scaled down by factor @xmath8 is also heron . furthermore the area of a heron triangle is always divisible by @xmath10 . it is sufficient to show this for @xmath8 prime . for @xmath11 it is obvious , for @xmath12 consider the term @xmath13 modulo 4 and one gets that it ca nt be congruent @xmath14 . the second part can in a similar way be checked modulo @xmath15 and @xmath16 . @xmath6      now i will give some examples for heron triangles . there are two main classifications for triangles : \{acute , right - angled and obtuse } and \{regular , isosceles and generic}. so we first search for right - angled and isosceles heron triangles . right - angled triangles have to be pythagorean but the reverse is also true :    any pythagorean triangle is a heron triangle . the lengths of the sides are integer , so we only have to proof that the area is integer . for the area @xmath4 holds @xmath17 , where @xmath0 and @xmath1 are the lengths of the catheti . hence if @xmath4 is not an integer then @xmath0 and @xmath1 have to be odd . but then follows @xmath18 and @xmath19 and that is not possible.@xmath6      any heron isosceles triangle is divided by the center line into two congruent pythagorean triangles . using proposition [ prop : peri ] we get that the basis must be an even number , say @xmath20 . let @xmath1 the length of the arms and @xmath21 be the length of the center line . now we only have to proof that @xmath21 is an integer . we get @xmath22 and from the heron formula @xmath23 . from @xmath4 is an integer follows that @xmath24 is a square number , but that is @xmath25 , so @xmath21 is integer.@xmath6    there is not intersection of this two classes  right - angled isosceles triangles do nt have integer sides . the examples in the previous section show that some classes of heron triangles can trivially be represented as lattice triangles . first we show the following weaker result . any heron triangle can be represented with rational coordinates . we only have to show that the height is rational and the length of the height - tiles . but this follows from the equations @xmath26 and @xmath27.@xmath6    there are heron triangles without integer heights as the example @xmath28 with area @xmath29 shows .    any heron triangle can be represented with integer coordinates . we know that it is representable with rational coordinates . then we can apply proposition [ prop : em2].@xmath6 a tetrahedron with given edges exists if and only if all faces exist ( i.e. in all triangles the triangle inequality holds , which is equivalent to : the right hand side of equation ( [ eq : heron ] ) is positive ) and the right hand side of equation ( [ eq : v3 ] ) is positive.@xmath6      if the sides of a heron tetrahedron have a common factor @xmath8 , then the volume is divisible by @xmath33 , i.e. the tetrahedron scaled down by factor @xmath8 is also heron . furthermore the volume of a heron tetrahedron is always divisible by @xmath34 .    as for triangles it is sufficient to show this for @xmath8 prime . for @xmath35 it is obvious . for @xmath36 one have to proof that if the determinant on the right hand side of equation ( [ eq : v3 ] ) is the double of a square and all areas of the faces are integer ( i.e. the right hand side of equation ( [ eq : heron ] ) is a square ) then it is divisible by @xmath37 . because i have no elegant proof for that this was done by a `` brute force '' calculation modulo @xmath38 and modulo @xmath7 using a computer program .              1 .

The text discusses the properties of Heron's formula, a formula used to calculate the area and perimeter of a triangle. It also introduces the concept of Heron's triangle, which is a triangle with integer sides and area. The text then explores the properties of right-angled and isosceles Heron triangles, including the classification of these triangles into two main types: right-angled and isosceles.

"mixtures of nonadsorbing polymers and colloidal particles often exhibit rich phase behavior @xcite . for certain polymer - to - colloid size ratios @xmath0 ( where @xmath1 is the radius of gyration of the polymer and @xmath2 is the radius of colloid ) entropy - driven effective interactions may lead to stable colloidal gas , liquid and solid phases even if all bare interactions are purely repulsive @xcite . a simple theoretical model giving an insight into this phenomenon is the asakura - oosawa - vrij ( aov ) model of colloid - polymer mixtures in which the polymers ( modeled as spheres ) are ideal and can overlap freely , but the polymer - colloid and colloid - colloid interactions are of the hard sphere type @xcite . effective attractive interactions in such systems arise due to a tendency to decrease the volume excluded to the polymer coils @xcite .    the aov model has attracted much attention due to its simplicity @xcite , however when comparing to experiments the agreement is only qualitative . this is due to the fact that the real polymers are nonideal . the incorporation of the polymer nonideality can be tackled at the monomer - resolved @xcite or coarse - grained @xcite levels of description . the latter technique is particularly useful in the so - called `` colloid limit '' ( @xmath3 ) , in which the full mixture is well described by invoking the effective , pairwise depletion potentials @xcite . however , when the polymer dimensions are larger than the size of the colloid particles , the resulting two - body effective potentials may be insufficient to correctly describe the underlying mixture and the incorporation of the higher - order , many - body terms becomes necessary @xcite . in addition to many industrial applications colloid - polymer mixtures offer a convenient tool to study important fundamental concepts that are often difficult to investigate in simple fluids , such as real space observation of the thermal capillary waves @xcite , the capillary length @xcite , the interfacial width @xcite and the interfacial tension of the fluid - fluid interface @xcite . wijting _ et al_. @xcite studied the behavior of colloid - polymer mixtures close to a wall . they found a wetting transition to a state in which the colloid - rich phase wets completely a nonadsorbing planar hard wall . these findings qualitatively agree with the results of density functional theory @xcite and computer simulations @xcite carried out for the aov model . et al_. @xcite used the cahn - fisher - nakanishi approach to study the wetting transition in mixtures of colloids and excluded volume polymers and pointed out some subtleties associated with the precise measurements of the contact angle @xcite . recently paricaud _ et al_. @xcite examined the bulk phase behavior of mixtures of hard - sphere colloids and excluded - volume polymers within the framework of wertheim s first - order thermodynamic perturbation theory ( tpt1 ) @xcite . they found a demixing transition into the colloid - rich and polymer - rich phases provided that the ratio of the colloid diameter to polymer segment diameter is large enough . the tpt1 description employs the microscopic description of the polymer , consequently it is treated on equal footing with the colloid particles . this theory provides thus a straightforward procedure of taking the attractive / repulsive interactions into account . however , the wertheim tpt1 approach is not free of its own deficiencies . we note here that incorporation of the solid - fluid equilibrium into the framework , while in principle possible @xcite , is difficult to execute for the colloid - polymer mixtures . moreover , boublik _ al_.@xcite pointed out that within the tpt1 theory the second virial coefficient scales quadratically with the chain length @xmath4 instead of @xmath5 , although it is possible to improve this deficiency @xcite . finally , the value of the flory exponent , @xmath6 , resulting from the tpt1 approach is 0.5 rather than 0.588 @xcite . despite these shortcomings , the tpt1 approach to colloid - polymer mixtures provides a welcome departure from the well - studied aov model .    in this work we focus on the surface phase behavior of model colloid - polymer mixtures . we employ nonlocal density functional theory that was used previously to investigate liquid - liquid interfaces of athermal mixtures of colloids and excluded - volume polymers @xcite . the density functional framework , proposed originally by yu and wu @xcite , uses the tpt1 ideas and yields in the limit of bulk systems an equation of state identical to that from ref .  @xcite . since the dft framework has already been described in detail @xcite we recall only the basic points of this approach . bulk phase diagram for a colloid polymer mixture with @xmath7 and @xmath8 . the main figure shows the binodal ( solid line ) , the spinodal ( dashed line ) , and the bulk critical point ( open circle ) evaluated in the polymer segment mole fraction -

[ fig:1 ] ( lower panel ) . the dotted lines denote bulk coexistence . , width=302 ]    the free energy of the system @xmath21 is a sum of the ideal and excess contributions , @xmath22 . the ideal part of the free energy is known exactly , @xmath23= \beta\int\!\!d{\bf r}\rho_{p}({\bf r})v_{b}({\bf r } ) + \int\!\!d{\bf r}\rho_{p}({\bf r})[\ln(\rho_{p}({\bf r}))-1 ] + \int\!\!d{\bf r } \rho_{c}({\bf r})[\ln(\rho_{c}({\bf r}))-1]$ ] . the total bonding potential , @xmath24 , is represented as a sum of the bonding potentials @xmath25 between the monomers , @xmath26 , and satisfies @xmath27\propto \prod_{i=1}^{m-1}\delta(|{\bf r}_{i+1}-{\bf r}_{i}|-\sigma_{ps})$ ] . furthermore , it is assumed that the excess free energy is a functional of the local density of colloids and average segment local density defined as @xmath28 . the excess polymer segment adsorption isotherm @xmath20 for a colloid - polymer mixture with @xmath7 and @xmath8 , calculated along a path of constant polymer segment packing fraction @xmath290.944 727 94 . the dashed line marks the prewetting transition , while the dotted line denotes bulk coexistence . the inset illustrates the nature of the divergence of the excess adsorption ( open circles ) upon approaching bulk coexistence . @xmath20 increases linearly as a function of the logarithm of the undersaturation @xmath30 . the straight solid line is a guide to the eye . , width=302 ]    within the approach of yu and wu @xcite the excess free energy is a volume integral over the excess free energy density , @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the excess free energy density of the reference mixture of hard spheres and @xmath33 is a perturbation contribution due to the chain connectivity . @xmath32 is evaluated using the elegant and inspiring white bear version @xcite of rosenfeld s fundamental measure theory ( fmt ) @xcite . likewise , fmt - style weighted densities are used for the polymer contribution , @xmath33 . we refer the reader to earlier papers for explicit formulae @xcite . the equilibrium density profiles were found from the condition @xmath34 } { \delta \rho_p(\mathbf{r})}= \frac{\delta\omega [ \rho_p({\bf r}),\rho_{c}({\bf r } ) ] } { \delta \rho_c({\bf r})}=0 \;.\ ] ] paricaud _ et al_. @xcite shown that within the wertheim approach a mixture of colloids and excluded volume polymers undergoes a demixing transition into the colloid - rich ( polymer - poor ) and colloid - poor ( polymer - rich ) phases . the properties of the fluid - fluid interface resulting from this theory were reported in ref . @xcite . in the present paper we investigate the wettability of hard structureless walls by such mixtures . the calculations were carried out for constant size ratio @xmath35 and for chain lengths @xmath36 , 100 , 120 and 200 . this corresponds to @xmath37 , 1 , 1.095 and 1.414 , and in the above we assumed that @xmath38 with @xmath39 and @xmath40@xcite . thus we consider both regimes @xmath41 and @xmath42 . in fig . [ fig:1 ] we recall the bulk phase diagram for the system with @xmath8 plotted in the polymer segment mole fraction , @xmath43 , - total density , @xmath44 , plane . this representation proved to be useful in carrying out numerical calculations presented below . if we disregarded the chain connectivity @xmath45 would correspond to the mole fraction of the small spheres in a mixture of big and small spheres , while @xmath46 and @xmath47 would correspond to the bulk number densities of small and big hard spheres , respectively . the bulk densities @xmath46 and @xmath47 serve as an input to the dft calculations . we note that the critical polymer segment mole fraction for the system depicted in fig . [ fig:1 ] is 0.976 763 34 , thus subcritical state points with lower mole fractions correspond to the polymer - poor ( colloid - rich ) side of the phase diagram while state points with @xmath45 higher than this value correspond to the the polymer - rich ( colloid - poor ) side . the numerical procedure of the evaluation of the surface phase diagrams relied on monitoring excess adsorption isotherms , @xmath48 , @xmath49c , ps , and grand potentials ( eq .  [ eq:1 ] ) calculated along paths of constant total density ( an example of such path labelled as `` i '' is shown in fig .  [ fig:1 ] ) , or along paths of constant polymer segment mole fraction ( the paths marked as `` ii '' and `` iii '' in fig . [ fig:1 ] ) . the inset to fig . [ fig:1 ] shows a comparison of the binodal evaluated for @xmath8 resulting from the werthiem tpt1 description with the binodal resulting from the free - volume theory for the aov model @xcite for @xmath50 . the diagrams are plotted in the colloid - polymer packing fraction representation . for such comparison to be possible one has to transform the microscopic polymer segment density @xmath46 into the polymer packing fraction defined as @xmath51 . when compared with the aov model the wertheim tpt1 approach leads to a shift of the colloid and polymer critical packing fractions similar to the perturbative treatment of warren _ et al_. @xcite and the geometrical - based approach @xcite . we note that the polymer packing fractions are too low when compared with experimental values @xcite . this is in part due to the fact that , as mentioned earlier , the wertheim tpt1 theory leads to the incorrect flory exponent ( @xmath40 rather than @xmath52 ) . we start the presentation of the results of dft calculations by analyzing the colloid - poor side of the bulk phase diagram . the upper panel of fig . [ fig:2 ] shows the excess polymer segment adsorption isotherm evaluated along path i , i.e. along a path of constant total density . we find the adsorption isotherm to be smooth and small in magnitude . we have carefully inspected adsorption isotherms calculated along paths similar to the path i for the system with @xmath8 and other chain lengths and have always found similar behavior . therefore we conclude that within the tpt1 formalism mixtures with the state points located on the colloid - poor side of the phase diagram always stays in the partial wetting / drying regime . this is the opposite of what is found in the wetting studies of the aov model @xcite . average polymer segment ( a ) and colloid ( b ) density profiles for a colloid - polymer mixture with @xmath7 and @xmath8 near a hard wall . the profiles are evaluated for constant polymer segment packing fraction @xmath290.944 727 94 and for total bulk densities @xmath53 0.012 3625 ( the dashed and solid lines correspond to the coexisting thin and thick film phases of the prewetting transition , respectively ) , 0.0126 ( dotted lines ) , and 0.012 617 ( dash - dotted lines ) . , width=302 ]    we turn now to the wetting properties of the state points located on the polymer - poor side of the phase diagram . the lower panel of fig . [ fig:2 ] shows the excess polymer segment adsorption isotherm calculated along path ii , i.e. along a path of constant polymer segment mole fraction @xmath290.928 889 85 . similar to the path i we find the adsorption isotherm to be smooth , small in magnitude , and finite at bulk coexistence . however , when paths located closer to the bulk critical point are considered , a drastic change in the behavior of the inhomogeneous colloid - polymer mixture is observed . this is illustrated in fig . [ fig:3 ] , where we show the adsorption isotherm , calculated along path iii i.e. along a path of constant @xmath290.944 727 94 . at lower total bulk densities the excess adsorption is very similar to that evaluated along path ii . however , as @xmath54 increases the adsorption isotherm makes a sudden jump ( marked by the dashed line ) to a large positive value and diverges upon approaching bulk coexistence ( denoted by the vertical dotted line ) . the nature of this divergence is investigated further in the inset to fig . [ fig:3 ] . we find that the excess adsorption diverges logarithmically and this behavior is characteristic of complete wetting for short range forces @xcite . we therefore conclude that in the tpt1 description the colloid - poor demixed phase wets completely the hard wall at coexistence . the wetting transition is of the first order and is accompanied by the prewetting ( or thin - thick film ) transition . morphology of the demixed mixture close to the hard wall is investigated further in fig . [ fig:4 ] where we show examples of the density profiles evaluated at fixed @xmath290.944 727 94 and for several total bulk densities . the dashed and solid lines correspond to the coexisting thin and thick film profiles ( these states are marked as black dots in fig .  [ fig:3 ] ) . the polymer segment profile ( cf . [ fig:4]a , dashed line ) corresponding to the thin film phase exhibits oscillations in the direct proximity of the wall , and the oscillation period approximately equals the colloid diameter . however the excess adsorption is small in magnitude and negative . the colloid profile ( cf . [ fig:4]b , dashed line ) also exhibits oscillations but the structure is much more pronounced and the profile exhibits a sharp and high first peak with a large contact value . this suggests that in the thin film phase the polymers are depleted from the wall , whereas the colloids are attracted to the wall and form a highly packed first layer .    on the other hand , in the thick film phase of the polymer segment density profile ( cf . [ fig:4]a , solid line ) one observes formation of a thick polymer layer next to the wall . as the total density increases ( cf . [ fig:4]a , dotted and dash - dotted lines ) the polymer - rich layer grows and extends over the distance of many colloid diameters . the structure of the colloids in the thick film phase is a reverse of the structure of the polymer . the contact value of the colloid profile ( see the inset to fig .  [ fig:4]b ) is reduced by more than a half at the prewetting transition @xcite suggesting that the colloids are depleted from the region adjoining the wall . the colloid - poor region broadens upon approaching bulk coexistence ( fig . [ fig:4]b , dotted and dash - dotted lines ) .     surface phase diagram for a colloid polymer mixture with @xmath7 and @xmath8 in the polymer segment mole fraction - total density plane . the binodal and the spinodal are denoted by the solid and dashed lines , respectively . the open circle denotes the bulk critical point . the filled circle denotes the wetting point whereas the triangle denotes the surface critical point . thick solid line denotes the prewetting line . the inset shows the surface phase diagram in the colloid - polymer packing fraction representation . , width=302 ]    figures [ fig:5 ] and [ fig:6 ] show the surface phase diagram for colloid - polymer mixtures with @xmath8 and @xmath55 , respectively . as in simple fluids the prewetting line tangentially meets the binodal in the wetting transition point ( marked by the filled circle ) and ends at the surface critical point ( marked by the triangle ) . in the polymer segment mole fraction - total density representation the prewetting line is located very close to the binodal and the surface critical point is well removed from the bulk critical point ( marked by the open circle ) . however , when the colloid - polymer packing fraction ( cf . the inset to fig . [ fig:5 ] ) or the polymer segment mole fraction - pressure representation is chosen ( cf . the inset to fig . [ fig:6 ] ) , the prewetting line is more distant from the binodal . we note that for all chain lengths considered the surface critical point pressure is lower than the pressure of the bulk demixing transition . this curious feature was also found in a recent study of the wetting behavior of polymer solutions @xcite . however in the present paper we do not find the lower wetting points and , despite considerable effort , we do not find any hints for the layering transitions in the partial wetting regime . a likely explanation to the last observation is that forsman and woodward @xcite considered a mixture of polymers and solvent molecules with diameter ratio @xmath56 . consequently , the individual polymer segments were effectively attracted to the wall due to the depletion forces induced by the overlap of the excluded volumes of the polymer segments and the wall . in the present study this effect does not come into play . surface phase diagram for a colloid polymer mixture with @xmath7 and @xmath55 in the polymer segment mole fraction - total density plane . the binodal and the spinodal are denoted by the solid and dashed lines , respectively . the open circle denotes the bulk critical point . the filled circle denotes the wetting point whereas the triangle denotes the surface critical point . thick solid line denotes the prewetting line . the inset shows the surface phase diagram in the polymer segment mole fraction - pressure representation . , width=302 ]    in a recent study of wettability of solid surfaces by short - chain fluids @xcite it was suggested that the wetting temperature for a given surface , when divided by the critical temperature , is almost independent on @xmath4 for longer chains . although in the athermal systems considered in the present paper the temperature does not have any significant role ( is a simple scaling parameter ) , other parameters like the reciprocal pressure play the role similar to the temperature in thermal systems . therefore the wetting point pressure rescaled by the critical pressure @xmath57 should barely depend on the chain length . the estimated wetting point pressure @xmath58 for systems @xmath36 , 100 , 120 , and 200 is 9.75 , 7.76 , 6.51 , and 4.25 , respectively . the corresponding @xmath59 thus are 0.814 , 0.818 , 0.824 , and 0.835 . this agrees nicely with the prediction @xcite . that the rescaled @xmath59 barely depends on @xmath4 has a simple explanation . as demonstrated in refs . @xcite , in the limit of an infinite chain length @xmath60 , and for fixed @xmath61 , the bulk critical pressure ( and also the colloid critical packing fraction ) tend to a finite , nonzero value with the leading order correction @xmath62 . this is the so - called `` protein limit '' of colloid - polymer mixtures @xcite . but then the wetting point pressure also should tend to a constant in that limit . therefore the rescaled wetting point pressure should barely depend on m for longer chains . we also note that the systematic deviations of @xmath59 from a constant suggest that the leading order chain - length dependent correction to @xmath63 is of different order than that for the bulk critical point . however the precise form of these corrections is rather difficult to estimate and we leave this problem for future work . wetting in the aov model for @xmath41 can be readily explained by invoking depletion interactions . the overlap of excluded volumes of a colloid and a wall is larger than the overlap between two colloidal particles and this gives rise to net colloid - wall attraction . consequently the colloid - rich phase favors the hard wall . our results are in opposition to the aov model results and show some features that are characteristic of wetting in athermal polymer solutions . the suggestion that the polymer - rich phase should wet the hard wall seems reasonable when @xmath42 . however , we find this behavior also for @xmath41 i.e. for @xmath7 , @xmath36 ( in order to be completely assured that our calculations are representative of the tpt1 description and are not a result of e.g. an artifact connected with the incorrect scaling of the polymer gyration radius , we checked that even for colloid - to - polymer - segment size ratios as large as @xmath64 and for chains as short as @xmath65 the polymer - rich phase wets completely the hard wall ) . this is at variance with experimental results . we connect this discrepancy with the inaccurate description of the bulk phase behavior resulting from the tpt1 theory , and identify two possible sources of errors . the first issue is connected with the incorrect scaling of the gyration radius and of the polymer second virial coefficient with @xmath4 . the consequence is that the dilute and semidilute regimes of long chains are not described accurately . this problem has already been recognized in the literature . proposed a simple correction that significantly improves the accuracy of the tpt1 description in the low density limit @xcite . a similar treatment , which combines the field - theoretic approach with liquid - state theory , was proposed by lue @xcite . however , at present it is not clear how these ideas can be extended to mixtures . to explain the second deficiency in the tpt1 description of colloid - polymer mixtures we recall that the wertheim approach , as any other perturbation theory , relies on the good description of the reference system . in this case it is a mixture of big and small hard spheres and we used the usual boublik - mansoori - carnahan - starling - leland ( bmcsl ) equation of state @xcite . however , it was argued @xcite that for highly asymmetric hard sphere mixtures a fluid - fluid phase separation occurs , which is metastable to a broad fluid - solid phase transition . consequently the bmcsl equation of state is not very accurate . the reference system in the tpt1 approach to colloid - polymer mixtures consists of a very low packing fraction of small spheres , therefore the potential impact of this problem seems to be moderate . we have used a microscopic density functional theory based on wertheim s first order thermodynamic perturbation theory to study the wetting behavior of athermal mixtures of colloids and excluded - volume polymers . in opposition to the wetting behavior in the aov model we have found the polymer - rich phase to wet a hard wall . the wetting transition is of first order and is accompanied by the prewetting transition . we have not found any hints for the layering transitions in the partial wetting regime . the rescaled wetting point pressure is very similar for mixtures with different chain lengths and the surface critical point pressure is lower than the pressure of the bulk demixing transition . we have found our results to resemble the wetting behavior in athermal polymer solutions . our considerations show that it is certainly a challenge to devise a monomer - resolved theory for colloid - polymer mixtures that is accurate in both the colloid , and protein limits . however , we feel that the wertheim approach could be a good candidate but this theory should incorporate the correct scaling behavior in the dilute polymer regime and an accurate description of the reference system .","The text discusses the wettability of hard structureless walls by colloid-polymer mixtures, specifically focusing on the wetting behavior of hard spheres and excluded volume polymers.
