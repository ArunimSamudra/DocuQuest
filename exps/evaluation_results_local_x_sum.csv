"They recorded their best result in Wales in 30 years, taking 11 out of 40 seats.
Among them was Gower, which was won by just 27 seats by the former detective Byron Davies, after more than a century in the hands of a succession of Labour MPs.
Jeremy Corbyn should have some fond memories as well.
His extraordinary rise in the summer from rank outsider to Labour leader was a reflection of the party's membership in Wales, as elsewhere.
The subsequent in-fighting in the party after Corbyn's victory could prove a real problem for Welsh Labour as it looks to hold on to power at the assembly next year.
In the meantime, the current Labour Welsh government completed its final full year.
And if there was an issue which dominated in Cardiff Bay, it was once again the state of the NHS.
Opposition parties maintained the pressure on waiting lists and the decision not to protect health spending between 2011 and 2013.
Labour ministers responded by pointing out that all was not rosy in the NHS in England and referring to its direct action such as putting Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board into special measures.
It was a relatively quiet political year for education.  Although minister Huw Lewis suggested that Welsh GCSE results would overtake England, it failed to materialise as the results in Wales matched the previous year.
Public Services Minister Leighton Andrews failed to get agreement from opposition parties for council re-organisation, which largely recreates the structure that existed in the 1970s and 80s with eight or nine large councils.
Instead, he has ploughed on with legislation to pave the way for the next Welsh government to dramatically reduce the existing 22 councils soon after taking charge, but the big question remains unanswered: can there be political agreement?
David Cameron and Nick Clegg visited the Millennium Stadium for what was called the St David's Day agreement to devolve more powers over energy, transport and elections.
Labour insisted there had been no agreement, and remained cool to much that had been proposed.
This turned into hostility over Tory plans to simplify the constitutional settlement when the First Minister Carwyn Jones accused Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb of putting devolution into reverse.
The other major constitutional development was the announcement from the Chancellor that partial control of income tax could be devolved without the need for a referendum.
Elsewhere, the Welsh government's plans for an M4 relief road around Newport put internal strain on what is normally a disciplined party.
Labour AM Jenny Rathbone criticised the proposals and was then sacked as chair of a committee at the assembly.
She responded by saying there was an unhealthy culture at the top of the Welsh government which did not allow for rigorous debate.
Her successor on the committee, fellow Labour AM Mick Antoniw, disagreed, saying he had often been critical and had ""not woken up in the morning with a horse's head in my bed"".
The parties in Wales won't have to deal with horses' heads next year, but there are plenty of challenges nevertheless.
Plaid have yet to take advantage of the increased profile of its leader Leanne Wood during the general election leaders' debates, although it helped her win the accolade of Welsh Politician of the Year.

"More than 1,500 children were held over alleged firearm offences between 2013 and January 2016.
Among the figures, the Metropolitan Police made 679 arrests, while seven children aged under 11 were held in Nottinghamshire.
The number of arrests rose by 20% last year, the Press Association said.
The data, obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, showed 1,549 children were arrested for suspected crimes involving firearms, air weapons or imitation guns.
A total of 506 charges were brought by police.
The brother of a fatal shooting victim said he believed gangs were using children to carry guns to avoid detection.
Ian Cameron Swanston, whose 20-year-old brother Dorrie was shot dead in Hulme, Manchester in 1999, also said some youngsters carried guns for ""status"".
Mr Swanston, who is a counsellor and trustee of the charity Mothers Against Violence, said: ""The more guns within the community, the more likely it is we will see younger children getting access to them.
""Gangs use children, they use their girlfriends. They use people who the police are unlikely to search.
""For some it's about status. Having a gun is seen as having power and people become fearful of you.""
Merseyside Police said 73 children were arrested between 2013 and 2015. Fourteen boys were charged with crimes involving firearms including robbery, possession of a firearm, possession of an air weapon in a public place, sending threats, wounding and false imprisonment.
West Midlands Police said 83 boys and one girl had been charged with firearm offences since 2013, including an 11-year-old boy in 2015, a 12-year-old boy in 2013 and eight boys aged 13.
The Police Service of Northern Ireland said nine boys and one girl were arrested for suspected firearm offences in 2015, compared with six boys in 2014 and seven boys and one girl in 2013.
Greater Manchester Police, which has investigated a string of gang-related shootings since ""Salford's Mr Big"" Paul Massey was shot dead in July, and Police Scotland were among the forces which did not provide figures.

"It includes:
Certainly, Sinn FÃ©in leader Gerry Adams thinks there has been a shift - last week he told Reuters that the Northern Ireland Assembly election result gave him and his supporters a sense that their long-term goal of Irish unity might be achievable.
Mr Adams also referred to developments on the other side of the Irish Sea, claiming that a decade ago Scottish independence might have seemed a ""minority occupation for men in kilts"", but now people had bought into the proposition.
On a similar theme, Tony Blair's former spin doctor Alastair Campbell told Good Morning Ulster that in relation to both Brexit and the Trump presidency ""we are living in an era in which nothing can be taken for granted"".
On the face of it, there seems much to encourage Irish nationalists and to disconcert Ulster unionists.
But although the needles are twitching on their political Ritcher scales, it is probably not yet time for the unionists to ""drop, cover and hold on"", the standard advice if caught in an earthquake.
Back in September last year, BBC Northern Ireland commissioned an opinion poll in the wake of the Brexit referendum.
This suggested that 63% of people in Northern Ireland supported staying in the UK whilst only 22% said they would vote to join a United Ireland.
It is entirely possible that, as the practical implications of Brexit unfold, this balance of opinion could shift. However, it is quite a differential for nationalists to overturn.
It would be wrong to assume that the loss of the unionist majority at Stormont in an election, dominated by a backlash to the DUP's style of government, would translate into a border poll.
Brexit may have shaken many people out of their comfort zone. However, any border poll campaign would focus, not just on people's identities and aspirations, but also on the multi-billion pound UK subvention, the future of the health service or the general stability of Northern Ireland.
At Stormont, it is the ""others"" who hold the theoretical balance of power and it is probable that many of their supporters might find the status quo more attractive than a step into the unknown.
One aspect of the Scottish debate which may have resonance in Northern Ireland in the coming months and years might be under whose authority a referendum can be called.
Ms Sturgeon has indicated she wants a vote between the autumn of 2018 and the spring of 2019, but it is up to Downing Street to grant the Section 30 order which would make the exercise legally binding.
Similarly, under the Good Friday Agreement, it is up to the UK government in the shape of the secretary of state for Northern Ireland to call a border poll ""if at any time it appears likely to him that a majority of those voting would express a wish that Northern Ireland should cease to be part of the United Kingdom and form part of a united Ireland"".
The agreement is silent on what might inform a secretary of state's decision, but generally it has been assumed to be the decisive result of an election or a consistent run of opinion polls suggesting a majority want change.
One can imagine that, just as Sinn FÃ©in has questioned the Treasury's estimates of the financial subvention, Irish nationalists could disagree with a future Northern Ireland secretary of state on whether the circumstances set out in the 1998 agreement have been met.
In turn, that argument could influence the debate in the run-up to any future border poll.
Back in September last year I wrote that I did not expect to find myself covering a border poll in my tenure as BBC NI political editor.
But maybe - given the recent seismological movement - I shouldn't rule anything out for certain.","Here's a concise summary of the article:

"Then a young man in his mid-20s, the future must have seemed bleak.
With few countries prepared to respond to China's actions, he faced a difficult task to protect Tibetans and their traditions.
Yet despite 50 years in exile, the reach of Tibet's spiritual leader has extended far beyond his community and he is now recognised as one of the world's leading religious figures.
He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989 for his consistent opposition to the use of violence in his quest for Tibetan self-rule.
But Beijing continues to view him as a ""splittist"", although he has repeatedly stated that his goal is for Tibetan autonomy rather than independence.
The 14th Dalai Lama was born on 6 July 1935, in a small village just outside the current boundaries of Tibet.
His parents, who named him Lhamo Dhondub, were farmers with several other children.
When he was two years old, a search party of Buddhist officials recognised him as the reincarnation of the 13 previous Dalai Lamas and he was enthroned before he turned four.
He was educated at a monastery and went on to achieve the Geshe Lharampa Degree, a doctorate of Buddhist philosophy.
But in 1950, when he was 15, the troops of Mao Tse-tung's newly-installed Communist government marched into Tibet.
As soldiers poured into the country, the Dalai Lama - his title means Ocean of Wisdom - assumed full power as head of state.
In May 1951, China drew up a 17-point agreement legitimising Tibet's incorporation into China.
When Tibetans took to the streets in 1959 demanding an end to Chinese rule, troops crushed the revolt and thousands of protesters were killed.
The Dalai Lama fled to India on foot and settled in Dharamsala, in the north of the country, which is now home to the Tibetan government-in-exile.
He was followed into exile by about 80,000 Tibetans, most of whom settled in the same area.
In exile, the Dalai Lama began the task of trying to preserve the culture of the Tibetan people and publicise their plight on the world stage.
He appealed to the United Nations and persuaded the General Assembly to adopt resolutions in 1959, 1961 and 1965 calling for the protection of the Tibetan people.
He has met political and religious leaders throughout the world and visited the late Pope John Paul II on several occasions.
The Dalai Lama has advocated a ""middle way"" to resolve the status of Tibet - genuine self-rule for Tibet within China.
In 1987, amid protests in Lhasa against the large-scale relocation of Han Chinese into Tibet, the Dalai Lama proposed a five-point plan, in which he called for the establishment of Tibet as a zone of peace.
But he did not move from his stance of peaceful resistance and in 1989 was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
The committee praised his policy of non-violence, which it called ""all the more remarkable when it is considered in relation to the sufferings inflicted on the Tibetan people"".
Despite their disagreements, the Dalai Lama has continued to seek dialogue with Beijing. Talks between the two sides broke down in 1993 and there were no more for nearly a decade.
Discussions resumed in 2002 and have continued intermittently but with no apparent progress.
Tensions between China and the Tibetan government-in-exile worsened in the wake of unrest in Tibet in March 2008 - the worst for 20 years.
Protests sparked by the anniversary of the 1959 uprising turned into riots on the streets of Lhasa. Violent protests were also reported among Tibetan communities in neighbouring regions.
China says at least 18 people were killed by rioters. Tibetan groups say as many as 200 people died in a crackdown by Chinese security forces.
The Dalai Lama is also facing challenges within the exile community.
Some young Tibetan activists believe pacificism does not work and, although most approve of the Dalai Lama's leadership, a growing number are calling for a tougher line.
There is also growing concern over who will leader the Tibetan movement in the future.
In March 2011, the Dalai Lama said that he planned to hand his political responsibilities to an elected representative, saying such a move was in the best interests of the Tibetan people.
""My desire to devolve authority has nothing to do with a wish to shirk responsibility,"" he said. ""It is to benefit Tibetans in the long run. It is not because I feel disheartened.""
""Tibetans have placed such faith and trust in me that as one among them I am committed to playing my part in the just cause of Tibet.""","Here's a concise summary of the text:

"In the past month, it has lost its new leader after 18 days and seen an MEP resign after a much-publicised fracas in Strasbourg.
This came after months of infighting and tussles between rival factions within the party.
So rather than basking in EU referendum glory, the question of reuniting UKIP was high on the agenda in front of about 200 party activists in central London.
Former deputy leader - and now leadership candidate - Paul Nuttall said he would ""let bygones be bygones"", and that the party had to ""forgive but not forget"".
""Let's stop knocking lumps out of each other,"" he urged, vowing to publish proposals for constitutional reform of the party to ""tighten everything up"".
Fellow candidate Suzanne Evans also called for changes to the party machinery, saying the ruling National Executive Committee had to be reformed and be made more open and accountable.

""Let's focus our fight on the real enemy.""
Businessman John Rees-Evans offered the most radical reform to party structure - an online balloting system that would see UKIP's policies set by its membership.
Unlike the more upbeat assessment of his rivals, Mr Rees-Evans provided a pessimistic outlook on the party's current predicament, saying it was in a ""crisis"", short of funds and with a declining membership.
Culture spokesman and London Assembly member Peter Whittle called for ""some form of collective responsibility"" from the party.
""We've got to be singing from the same hymn sheet when we go out into the public,"" he added.
Candidates also set out their policy priorities, and aside from Brexit - where they all agreed on taking the fastest route out of the European Union - immigration, combating Islamic extremism and curbing the rise of Sharia courts were common themes.
There were no questions on the death penalty, which divided the panel at an earlier LBC debate.
Mr Nuttall vowed to replace Labour as the ""patriotic voice of the working class"", while Ms Evans said it had to broaden its appeal to more women and ethnic minority voters, vowing to put more ""kippers"" in schools and teaching unions to ensure pupils are taught ""to be proud of Britain"".
Mr Whittle said every school should display the union jack and a picture of the Queen.
Mr Rees-Evans said he would aim to increase the party membership to 500,000, warning that the other candidates would continue UKIP's ""current demise"".

"The charity's jousting expert Dominic Sewell told BBC's Radio 5 live that the medieval pursuit was a ""worldwide phenomenon that should be recognised"".
Only about 20 people in the UK joust competitively, but the charity said tournaments were held across the world.
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) said it was ""unaware"" of any official request for its recognition.
For a sport to be included in the Olympic Games programme, it must be governed by an international federation, practised widely across the world, and meet other various criteria before being considered by the IOC's executive board.
English Heritage said it had made an initial approach to the IOC and the Federation Equestre Internationale (FEI) - which governs all Olympic equestrian disciplines - as a first step on jousting's road to the Olympics.
Jousting would need to be recognised by the FEI before it could be considered as an Olympic sport by the IOC, English Heritage said.
Mr Sewell, who jousts competitively, said: ""Just like the Olympic British equestrian team, we ride beautiful horses to an exceptional level.""
He said jousting required a ""huge amount of skill and a daily training regime"", adding one had to be ""strong, not just physically but mentally, so you can sit fearlessly in your saddle, face your rival, and offer yourself as a target"".
Mr Sewell, a former furniture assembler in a factory, said: ""This has gone from being a hobby to being a sport and a career.""
He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme his interest had originally been fuelled by visiting historical re-enactments, but added: ""I'm a sportsman, I'm not an actor.""
Mr Sewell went on: ""As soon as I got on a horse everything changed and I thought: this is what I want to do, I want to be good at this.""
English Heritage admitted it could be a ""long road"" to get jousting recognised as an Olympic sport, but said there were ""encouraging signs"".
Tournaments were growing in popularity, the charity said, and were now held in countries such as Belgium, Brazil and New Zealand.
In the US, where jousting has been the official state sport of Maryland since 1962, competitors have launched a similar Olympic campaign.
Jousting today is ""quite a safe sport to take part in"", Mr Sewell says.
""The rules are essentially that you are in a single combat situation, in a designated area, in a pitch - or 'tilt-yard' - and in that yard is a tilt rail.""
The competitors charge down the rail towards each other with points awarded on the style and strength of their hit.
Wearing a suit of armour weighing around 20kg, the athletes hold a 12ft lance in one hand and their horse's reins in the other, all while riding towards their opponents at a flat-out gallop - at speeds of up to 30mph.
""These days injuries are few and far between... but the odd un-horsing might result in a few bruises,"" Mr Sewell says.
The IOC said its programme was currently being addressed as part of the Olympic Agenda 2020, the group's strategy for the future of the Olympics.
A spokesman said: ""One recommendation was to make the Olympic programme more flexible by moving from a sport-based to an event-based programme.""
Earlier this month, the IOC supported a bid to add karate, skateboarding, sports climbing, surfing and baseball/softball to the programme for Tokyo 2020.
If approved, the inclusion would add 18 events and 474 athletes to the Olympic Games.
Jousting, with its roots in Ancient Greece, where it was practised as part of preparations for war, emerged in England in the 10th Century as a sport for knights to hone their equine and lance skills.
The first jousting tournament in England is said to have been arranged by the Frenchman Godfrey de Preuilly in 1066.
The tournaments became so popular that in the 12th Century, King Henry II banned the sport, as he considered it too dangerous to have a number of highly skilled knights in the same place at the same time.
The ban was lifted under King Richard I and the sport remained popular, particularly during the Tudor era, until declining after the French King Henry I was killed during a joust in 1559.
Jousting enjoyed a revival under 19th Century romanticism, with writers such Lord Byron, Percy Shelley and Sir Walter Scott glamorising notions of chivalry with tales of knights and fair maidens.","Here's a concise summary of the article:

"Research and DNA tests identified the remains of David Williams, 22, from Colwyn Bay, Conwy county.
He drowned during a military operation near Waalwijk, North Brabant, on 5 February 1945.
He was buried at a nearby cemetery in the presence of Royal Marines and the Dutch Marine Corps on Wednesday.
His remains were found in a shallow grave during an explosives-detection project on land occupied during the war at Overdiepse Polder.
Four allied nations were known to have fought in the area and it was recorded that three marines died in a boating accident, and one body was missing.
Through DNA testing, the Recovery and Identification Unit in the Royal Netherlands Army (RIU/RNLDA) found his half-sister, Sheila Clough.
They shared the same biological mother but Ms Clough said she had been unaware of her half-brother until last year as her mother had never spoken about Mr Williams - who had been given up for adoption.
Ms Clough said: ""This past year has been unbelievable, a complete emotional rollercoaster.
""I am extremely proud of David and his service with the Royal Marines and am grateful to everyone who has helped to finally lay him to rest in such a proud and dignified manner.""
The British No. 41 Royal Marine Commando had been operating in the area when three marines drowned trying to recover a collapsible canvas assault boat from the enemy side of the river.
But the body of Mr Williams, who joined the marines in 1940 and could not swim, was not found until 2010.

"Taxis and billboards across the capital have been daubed with posters claiming that Uber does not pay tax in the UK.
The Licensed Taxi Drivers Association (LTDA) said the campaign is to ""highlight what we are up against"".
But Uber said the facts in the posters were ""simply wrong"" and that it complied with tax rules.
The posters depict Uber's senior vice president of policy and strategy Rachel Whetstone and Prime Minister David Cameron, with whom she is friends, beside a picture of Chancellor George Osborne - claiming that Uber pays no tax in  the UK.
A fleet of taxis covered in the posters lined up in protest outside Mansion House in the City of London, where Mr Osborne was speaking on Wednesday night.
The campaign will initially feature on 250 cabs and three advertising vans as well as being displayed on more than 25 digital sites across London.
""These ads are not anti-Uber,"" Steve McNamara, general secretary of the LTDA  told the BBC.
""The campaign is designed to highlight that the lobbying arm of Uber, a $50bn US company, has its tentacles embedded deep within Whitehall.
""The irony is that UK tax payers are subsidising Uber, a company that pays no tax in the UK, through tax credits and other DWP (Department of Work and Pensions) benefits paid to Uber drivers earning less than minimum wage.""
Uber said in response: ""The campaign is simply incorrect. We pay taxes in every country we operate in and comply with all local and international tax laws, this includes the UK.""
""A lot of our growth is driven by referrals from drivers. The drivers recommend the job to their friends because they love working on the Uber platform.""
Last year, Uber's tax affairs were referred to HMRC by Transport for London following a complaint from Labour MP Margaret Hodge that it was opting out of the UK tax regime.
Its European head office is in the Netherlands.
Many consumers like the convenience and affordability offered by Uber but cab firms in many cities feel aggrieved that it is not subject to the same stringent regulations as them.

"The tycoon told the BBC he would probably join a club for party donors called the Leader's Group.
This club requires an annual membership fee of Â£50,000.
Lord Ashcroft - also a former party treasurer - donated millions of pounds to the Conservatives, often targeted at marginal seats, but fell out with ex-prime minister David Cameron in 2010.
Speaking to BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg, the peer praised Mr Cameron's replacement, Theresa May, for her speech on Brexit to the Conservative conference on Sunday.
Asked whether he would be prepared to donate again, he said: ""I think, probably, I might join the Leader's Group again but that's a small sum compared to historically what I have given to the party.""
The Leader's Group is described as the Conservative Party's ""premier supporter group"".
Members are invited to join the prime minister and other senior figures at dinners, drinks receptions and other events, in exchange for their annual Â£50,000 donation.
Lord Ashcroft, who was ranked 74 in the 2015 Sunday Times Rich List, said he hoped that under Mrs May the party would have ""significantly broadened"" its funding base so it was not dependent on individuals giving ""seven-figure sums"".
Asked whether he would be prepared to donate smaller sums, he replied: ""Under the appropriate circumstances and the direction in which it's heading, it's very nice to be back.""
Lord Ashcroft was deputy chairman of the Conservative Party during Mr Cameron's period as Leader of the Opposition.
In July 2010, he gave up his non-domiciled tax status after a law was passed requiring peers and MPs to be tax resident and domiciled in order to remain in Parliament.
His tax status had long been criticised by his opponents.
When he co-authored a book on Mr Cameron last year, he admitted to having personal ""beef"" with the prime minister after not being offered a major job in the coalition government following the 2010 general election.

"However, as the celebrity can still appeal to the Supreme Court he cannot be named - yet.
One of the grounds to lifting the reporting ban was that the allegations were now widespread.
This was due to publication of the story in Scotland and other countries. It was published north of the border as the injunction did not apply outside England and Wales.
As Scotland is a separate legal jurisdiction, foreign judgments, including those from England and Wales, require to be registered in Scotland to work.
However, a foreign judgment can only be registered in Scotland if it is a final order of the court.
Interim orders are issued during the course of an action for protective purposes until the court has the opportunity of hearing the case and making a final order.
The gagging order obtained by the celebrity was an interim injunction. It was not a final judgment and so could not be enforced in Scotland.
If the celebtrity had wanted to obtain protection in Scotland, the celebrity would have needed to go to the Scottish court seeking interim interdict (the Scottish term for an interim injunction). This could be done in two ways:
There is little practical difference between the two approaches.
If an interim interdict had been granted under either of those two options then it would have stopped the printed publication in Scotland and the Court of Appeal might have come to a different decision.
So, what's going to happen now? On Monday the court gave the man time to apply to take his case to the UK Supreme Court.
In the ruling, they said there must be no publication leading to disclosure of the celebrity's identity before 13:00 BST on Wednesday.
The celebrity - who has young children and whose spouse is also well-known - has until 10:00 BST on Tuesday to submit arguments to the Supreme Court.

Champions Ireland begin life without retired talisman Paul O'Connell by hosting a Wales side seeking a fourth title under coach Warren Gatland.
France, also under new management, host Italy in the weekend's first match.
Nearly a million fans will have filled stadiums in London, Paris, Rome, Cardiff, Dublin and Edinburgh by the time the sport's oldest tournament ends on 19 March.
Historic rivalries make the Six Nations a colourful and boisterous spectacle off the pitch.
But with last year's World Cup semi-finals comprising only southern hemisphere sides, these six sides will be eager to prove they are just as eye-catching on the pitch.
The Six Nations will offer a fresh start for many, with England in particular looking to banish memories of a dreadful World Cup campaign.
As well as a new coach, they have a new captain in Dylan Hartley, and are aiming to atone for becoming the first host nation to fail to progress beyond the World Cup group stages.
Chris Robshaw, who captained England to the home World Cup defeats by Australia and Wales that ultimately ended Stuart Lancaster's reign, starts at Murrayfield and has said this tournament feels like a ""new start"" and a chance to ""right some wrongs"".
A resurgent Scotland, who suffered a heartbreaking 35-34 last-eight defeat by eventual finalists Australia at the World Cup, are far more expressive these days under coach Vern Cotter and victory over the auld enemy would give them a first Calcutta Cup win since 2008.
A good start is essential for the Scots - who have not won the title since 1999 - if they are to build on their World Cup campaign.
But history is against the hosts as they have only won their first game of the Six Nations once, in 2006, and have not scored a try against England at Murrayfield since 2004.
Back-to-back champions Ireland host a Wales team who have won the Grand Slam in the last two post-World Cup Six Nations.
Both are title contenders, although the defending champions are dealing with a future without former captain O'Connell, while top-class players including Cian Healy, Iain Henderson, Tommy Bowe, Peter O'Mahony and Luke Fitzgerald are unavailable for Sunday's match.
Ireland's long injury list may give Wales the advantage in a contest many believe will determine the outcome of the championship.
Ireland coach Joe Schmidt has said facing Wales will be ""a challenge"", pointing to the average size and experience of Gatland's men.
""They have comfortably 300 caps more than any other team,"" said Schmidt, regarded as one of the best coaches in world rugby.
""On top of that, the stats at the World Cup show that they are literally the biggest team in world rugby, averaging 106kg a man. For us, that is going to be a challenge, because we are not the biggest. We have also shed about 300 caps.""

A home tie against Italy, who have propped up the table in 10 of the past 16 seasons, should present Noves with a smooth start to the competition.

"Evans, 25, was freed last month after serving two and a half years for rape.
A Blades statement said: ""After due consideration, the board has decided to respond favourably to the PFA's request to allow Evans to train at the club.""
However, they are ""not prepared at this time"" to decide whether to re-sign the Wales international striker.
The League One club's statement continued: ""The club acknowledges receipt of a request from the PFA to the effect that the club consider allowing Mr Evans, who is a PFA member, to train at the club's facilities.
""According to the request, this training would be with a view to enabling Mr Evans to get back to a level of fitness, which might enable him to find employment in his chosen trade.
""This request has come to the club, because it is the last club at which Mr Evans was registered before his conviction.
""The club agrees with the recent statements of the PFA, to the effect that professional footballers should be treated as equals before the law, including in circumstances where they seek to return to work following periods of incarceration.
""There can be no place for 'mob justice'.""
Sheffield United's statement was released at 18:00 GMT, eight hours after the news of Evans training with the club was broken by BBC Sport.

The Football League said that ""while we fully understand the gravity of the offence"", if a request was received from any of its member clubs to register Evans, they would ""have no option but to accept it"".
Evans, who maintains his innocence, has scored 59 goals in 167 appearances during spells with Manchester City, Norwich City and Sheffield United.
He was sentenced to five years in April 2012 for raping a 19-year-old woman in a hotel room in May 2011, having been found guilty by a jury at Caernarfon Crown Court. At his trial, he admitted to having sex with the woman but denied rape.
Evans was released from prison in October after serving half of his sentence. He has not offered any apology to his victim.
He has so far declined any request to be interviewed by the BBC, but released a video statement on his personal website, in which he said he wanted to play again.
An inquiry into his conviction is to be fast-tracked by the Criminal Cases Review Commission, the body which examines potential miscarriages of justice.
Almost 157,000 people have signed a petition urging Sheffield United not to take the player back after the club chose not to renew his contract following his conviction. His deal expired during his incarceration.
Campaign groups have criticised the decision to allow him to train with his former club.
Rape Crisis England & Wales spokeswoman Katie Russell said: ""Sheffield United has given no indication that they feel they have any responsibility towards the huge numbers of sexual violence survivors who follow their club or attend its matches.
""It has become clear that many people still consider rape in some contexts and circumstances more 'real', more harmful than others, and believe some rape survivors are therefore more 'worthy' of empathy than others.""
End Violence Against Women Coalition spokeswoman Sarah Green said: ""We are appalled that top football club Sheffield United are taking the first step to allowing an unrepentant convicted rapist back into their team this week.
""Footballers are critical role models for young men and women in particular, and the player concerned is now set to return to top-flight football when he has shown no remorse for his crime.""
Sources maintain that Blades manager Nigel Clough is still to decide whether he wants the striker in his squad, and insist that allowing Evans to train with them does not necessarily mean he will be offered a fresh contract.
However, Clough has said that any decision on the convicted rapist is one for United's co-owners, Prince Abdullah Bin Musa'ad Bin Abdul Aziz of Saudi Arabia, and Kevin McCabe.
Meanwhile, television presenter Charlie Webster announced on Newsnight her resignation as a Sheffield United club patron following the club's decision to allow the player to train.
""Sheffield United are yet to make a decision or acknowledge the severity of Ched Evans's crime,"" said Webster, who previously revealed she was a victim of sexual assault and is a campaigner against domestic violence.","Here's a concise summary of the article:

"Germany's federal statistics office Destatis, said the annual rate of inflation fell to 0.2% in December from 0.6% a month earlier.
That was its lowest level since October 2009.
It comes two days before eurozone inflation figures for December, which some analysts believe will show the currency bloc falling into deflation.
Inflation in the 18-nation currency bloc in November stood at 0.3% according to the European Union's statistics agency, Eurostat.
It has been below the Bank's target of 2%, or just below, since the start of 2013.
A number of other eurozone countries, including Spain and Italy, have already fallen into deflation.
Using the European Central Bank's (ECB) preferred statistical calculations -  the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) - German inflation was even lower at 0.1% in December.
The latest figures will increase pressure on the ECB to begin buying government debt.
After the ECB's December meeting left interest rates unchanged at 0.05%, the bank's president, Mario Draghi, said it had ""stepped up"" its preparations to act if needed, and help prop up inflation in the eurozone.
While low inflation leads to lower prices and can be good news for consumers, it can also lead to falling economic activity, job losses and recession.
Consumers and businesses tend to postpone making purchases or investments in the belief that prices may fall further.
This can lead prices even lower to the point where businesses are forced to lay off staff or even close altogether.
In the summer the ECB cut interest rates to a new all-time low and began an asset purchase programme to inject cash into the economy to help combat deflation.
But big falls in the price of oil, which has fallen more than 50% in the past six months, has had a greater impact on prices, continuing to push them lower.
Jennifer McKeown at Capital Economics said that the fall in German inflation was largely due to lower oil prices, and that the broader eurozone figure was likely to be negative for the first time since October 2009.
She added: ""Such a development would surely make the pressure for the ECB to implement quantitative easing at its January meeting irresistible.""
But concerns remain over how the ECB will structure its bond buying programme and whether Greek bonds will be included - given the uncertainty over which political party will win the snap election called for three days after the next ECB meeting.
The far-left Syriza party, which has vowed to reverse the austerity measures that were a condition for Greek bailout packages totalling Ã¢âÂ¬240bn (ÃÂ£187bn), holds a narrow lead in opinion polls.","Here's a concise summary of the article:

"Carwyn Jones said the left-winger had ""energised a huge number of people who were previously disengaged from party politics"".
He called on Labour to ""come together, get organised and take on the Tories"".
The first minister had previously said Mr Corbyn would be ""an unusual choice"" for leader.
Mr Corbyn was declared the winner of the contest to succeed Ed Miliband at a special Labour party event in London on Saturday with nearly 60% of first preference votes.
Tom Watson was elected to serve as his deputy.
Despite initially being seen as the rank outsider, Mr Corbyn saw a surge in support to beat his more mainstream rivals Andy Burnham, Yvette Cooper and Liz Kendall.
Shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves and education spokesman Tristram Hunt have both said they will not serve on the new leader's front bench, while Ms Cooper said she did not expect to be asked.
However, Shadow Welsh Secretary Owen Smith said he was ""a Labour man first and foremost"" and would be willing to serve in Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet.
He described the leadership election as ""an amazing moment"", calling on Labour to unite and ""capitalise"" on the interest of more than 400,000 people who voted in the contest.
""We've got a phenomenon on our hands that we need to work with for the betterment of the people we seek to represent,"" he said.
First Minister Carwyn Jones congratulated Mr Corbyn on his ""impressive"" win.
He added: ""His campaign has energised a huge number of people who were previously disengaged from party politics and we must embrace that.
""We should also thank the other leadership candidates for a campaign well-fought. The challenge for the party now is to come together, get organised and take on the Tories.
""I look forward to meeting with Jeremy soon to discuss our campaign plans for the vital election in Wales next year.""
During his victory speech, Mr Corbyn praised Mr Jones for his leadership in Wales.
He congratulated Welsh Labour for ending the internal market in the health service, saying it was ""something we want to do in the rest of Britain"".
Other leading Welsh Labour figures called for unity behind their new leader.
Shadow Culture Secretary and Rhondda MP Chris Bryant told BBC News: ""We're good at knocking lumps out of each other ... we need to knock lumps out of the Tories.""
Cynon Valley MP Ann Clwyd tweeted: ""Jeremy - brill!  Human rights will be safe in your hands.
""Your tenacity and sincerity have inspired a new generation.""
Newport West MP Paul Flynn said on Twitter: ""All the forecasts of doom by media and Labour's extinct volcanoes blown over by vast scale of victory from party members old and new.
""As a member of the select exclusive band of Liz Kendall supporters, I rejoice that we are all Corbyn-ites now,"" he added.
Baroness Eluned Morgan, a former Euro-MP who hopes to run for the assembly in 2016, tweeted: ""A new chapter in the history of the Labour Party begins. It's going to be a roller coaster ride. Hold onto your hats!""
Opposition parties appeared scornful of Labour's prospects under their new leader.
Reacting for the Conservatives, Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb said on Twitter: ""Welsh Labour finally have a UK leader in its mould - [they] have banned Free Schools, Academies, Right to Buy.
""Wales already a test bed for Corbynism.""
Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood said Mr Corbyn's victory would do nothing to change ""Labour's terrible record in government in Wales"".
""Plaid Cymru congratulates Jeremy Corbyn on his election,"" she added.
""We hope that he will now deliver the votes of his MPs to join Plaid Cymru MPs in opposing those Tory policies that are causing great harm to people in Wales and beyond.
""However, his election cannot alter Labour's dismal record in government in Wales.
""Their legacy, especially since devolution, is one of failure and managed decline.""
Welsh Liberal Democrat leader Kirsty Williams said: ""The reality is that Labour under Corbyn will become exactly the opposite of what this country needs right now: anti-Europe, anti-business and economically illiterate.""
So how will Jeremy Corbyn's victory go down in the only part of the UK where there's a devolved Labour government?
A number of senior figures in Wales have been telling me privately how concerned they are about the implications for the assembly election in 2016.
Above all it will be a judgment of the record of Carwyn Jones's government, but the fear among many is that a Corbyn win will make it easier for opponents to challenge in marginal seats like the Vale of Glamorgan, the Vale of Clwyd and Cardiff North, where the Tories performed well in the general election but which are held by Labour in the assembly.
And will Welsh Labour MPs unite behind the new leader? The jury is still out.
One told me there is a tendency to catastrophise about a party that is surprisingly resilient while another told me how hard he would find it to be loyal to a man who has rebelled so often in the past.
And what about the new party members who joined up because of Corbyn? They have been as visible in Wales as elsewhere.
Their big hope is that the new leader drags the centre ground of British politics to where they believe it should be - to the left.","Here's a concise summary of the article:

"The two sides are meeting for the first time in nearly three years to negotiate an end to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict based on the two-state solution formula.
Who is taking part in the negotiations?
In Jerusalem, the Palestinians will be represented by senior negotiator Saeb Erekat and senior Fatah official Muhammed Shtayyeh. Israeli Minister of Justice Tzipi Livni and prime ministerial aide Isaac Molcho will represent the Israeli side.
US Middle East Peace Envoy Martin Indyk and his deputy, Frank Lowenstein, have been named as envoys to the meeting.
Since his appointment in February, US Secretary of State John Kerry has invested much political capital and time in convincing the two sides to resume talks.
What has happened so far?
The two sides met with US mediators on 29 and 30 July in Washington to officially launch the peace talks.
This came after Mr Kerry got the parties to agree to resume negotiations. The terms of the deal he hammered out have not been disclosed.
But as part of the process, Israel has agreed to release 104 long-serving Palestinian prisoners. This began with 26 in the early hours of 14 August.
The Palestinians, for their part, are expected to refrain from upgrading their membership of UN agencies.
The resumption of talks was preceded by the Israeli government's announcement of the construction of some 2,000 new settler homes in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.
The Palestinians voiced dismay but Mr Kerry said the move was ""not unexpected"".
Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem are considered illegal under international law, although Israel disputes this.
What are they talking about?
Mr Kerry said in late July that all final-status issues - Jerusalem, borders, security arrangements, settlements and Palestinian refugees - would be on the table.
He did not specify a timetable and added that both sides had agreed to keep the contents of meetings confidential.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in an April meeting with Mr Kerry that Palestinian recognition of Israel as a Jewish state would be among the first issues.
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas told reporters in Cairo in July that the talks would focus first on borders and security.
What's the timeframe for the peace process?
The US has announced that final-status talks will be held for nine months. Officials on the two sides have indicated their agreement to this.
After the initial Jerusalem talks, the parties will meet later in Jericho in the West Bank, although a date for this round has not yet been set.
Why is it so hard to reach agreement?
The negotiations will resume amid challenging circumstances for both sides.
The Palestinians are divided politically between the West Bank-based Fatah and Islamist Hamas movement, which has controlled the Gaza Strip since 2007, and has condemned the talks.
Some other Palestinian groups, such as the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), staged protests against the talks.
Mr Netanyahu also faces internal challenges. Despite the public support for peace talks, some of his coalition partners - for example the Jewish Home party - and members of his own Likud party oppose the establishment of a Palestinian state.
More importantly, the two sides appear to have wide gaps separating their optimal positions. The Palestinians want East Jerusalem to be the capital of their state, an idea that is vehemently opposed by some parties in the Israeli cabinet, who maintain Jerusalem should be the undivided capital of Israel.
Mr Netanyahu's government is likely to insist on keeping some Israeli settlements in the West Bank or East Jerusalem as part of a final deal. Previous talks have suggested mutually-agreed land swaps with the Palestinians as a way to achieve this.
What has been agreed in previous deals?
The 1993 Oslo accords ushered in a new era with the formation of the Palestinian Authority as an interim body and the withdrawal of Israeli troops from parts of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
But the assassination of former Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in 1995 put the process on hold. Subsequent Israeli governments carried out more territorial withdrawals and signed further economic agreements, but without ending the conflict..
In September 2008, the two sides appeared to be close to signing a final peace deal during talks between former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Mr Abbas. However, this round ended fruitlessly after Mr Olmert's resignation over corruption charges and the alleged refusal by Mr Abbas to accept the Israeli offer.
What is at stake for the rest of the region?
The Palestinian-Israeli conflict has long been seen as a driver of negative sentiment towards Israel in the Middle East and the wider Muslim world.
But the talks are resuming against the backdrop of regional upheavals after the Arab Spring. Since 2011, many neighbouring Arab countries, especially Egypt and Syria, have been in turmoil.
At stake is also the legacy of the Obama administration, and its push for better ties with the Muslim world.

"There were systemic failures at the state department, but no individual official ignored their duties, it adds.
US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has accepted all 29 recommendations contained in the report.
The 11 September attack saw Ambassador Christopher Stevens, as well as three other US officials, killed.
The ambassador died of smoke inhalation when he was trapped alone in the burning consulate building, after armed men had stormed the compound.
The assault triggered a major political row over who knew what and when. As a result, an independent panel - the Accountability Review Board- was charged with investigating the incident.
The report identified the state department's Bureau of Diplomatic Security and Bureau of Near East Affairs for criticism over their apparent lack of cooperation and ensuing confusion with regards to protection.
""Systematic failures and leadership and management deficiencies at senior levels within two bureaus of the State Department resulted in a Special Mission security posture that was inadequate for Benghazi and grossly inadequate to deal with the attack that took place,"" the panel concluded.
However, the review has not suggested disciplinary action be taken against any individuals.
Despite ""a lack of transparency, responsiveness, and leadership"" among certain senior state department officials, the report found no ""reasonable cause"" that any specific individuals had ""engaged in misconduct or wilfully ignored"" their responsibilities.
It also said there had been ""no immediate, specific"" intelligence about the 11 September attack or threats to the consulate.
In a letter to congressional committees, Mrs Clinton said she had ordered the state department to implement the investigation's findings ""quickly and completely"".
She outlined some steps the agency would take, including sending hundreds of Marine guards to US missions abroad and assigning a state department official to oversee ""high threat posts"".
In addition, Mrs Clinton said the state department would request more funding from Congress to make improvements to security.
The probe concluded that the US personnel had ""performed with courage and readiness to risk their lives to protect their colleagues in a near-impossible situation"".
But the Benghazi mission had nevertheless been hampered by a lack of resources. The reliance on armed ""but poorly skilled"" local militiamen and contract guards was ""misplaced,"" the report said.
""The solution requires a more serious and sustained commitment from Congress to support State Department needs which constitute a small percentage of the full national budget and that spent for national security,"" according to the review.
The probe also criticised the Libyan government's response to the attack, characterising it as ""profoundly lacking"".

"The team uncovered the signature of a planet that had been ""eaten"" by looking at the chemistry of the host star.
They also think a surviving planet around this star may have been kicked into its unusual orbit by the destruction of a neighbouring world.
Details of the work have been published in Astrophysical Journal Letters.
The US-Polish-Spanish team made the discovery when they were studying the star BD+48 740 - which is one of a stellar class known as red giants. Their observations were made with the Hobby Eberly telescope, based at the McDonald Observatory in Texas.
Rising temperatures near the cores of red giants cause these elderly stars to expand in size, a process which will cause any nearby planets to be destroyed.
""A similar fate may await the inner planets in our solar system, when the Sun becomes a red giant and expands all the way out to Earth's orbit some five billion years from now,"" said co-author Prof Alexander Wolszczan from Pennsylvania State University in the US.
The first piece of evidence for the missing planet comes from the star's peculiar chemical composition.
Spectroscopic analysis of BD+48 740 revealed that it contained an abnormally high amount of lithium, a rare element created primarily during the Big Bang 14 billion years ago.
Lithium is easily destroyed in stars, so its high abundance in this ageing star is very unusual.
""Theorists have identified only a few, very specific circumstances, other than the Big Bang, under which lithium can be created in stars,"" Prof Wolszczan explained.
""In the case of BD+48 740, it is probable that the lithium production was triggered by a mass the size of a planet that spiralled into the star and heated it up while the star was digesting it.""
The second piece of evidence discovered by the astronomers is the highly elliptical orbit of a newly discovered planet around the red giant star. The previously undetected world is at least 1.6 times as massive as Jupiter.
Co-author Andrzej Niedzielski of Nicolaus Copernicus University in Torun, Poland, said that orbits as eccentric as this one are uncommon in planetary systems around evolved stars.
""In fact, the BD+48 740 planet's orbit is the most elliptical one detected so far,"" he added.
Because gravitational interactions between planets are often responsible for such peculiar orbits, the astronomers suspect that the dive of the missing planet toward its host star before it became a giant could have given the surviving massive planet a burst of energy.
This boost would have propelled it into its present unusual orbit.
Team member Eva Villaver of the Universidad Autonoma de Madrid in Spain commented: ""Catching a planet in the act of being devoured by a star is an almost improbable feat to accomplish because of the comparative swiftness of the process, but the occurrence of such a collision can be deduced from the way it affects the stellar chemistry.
""The highly elongated orbit of the massive planet we discovered around this lithium-polluted red giant star is exactly the kind of evidence that would point to the star's recent destruction of its now-missing planet.""","Here's a concise summary of the text:

"The plans for Anfield, which are subject to a public consultation, would see Liverpool FC's stadium expanded and new housing and a business hub built.
The plan would also see the creation of a wide avenue through Stanley Park, which would end in a new public square.
A spokesman for Liverpool City Council said the completed buildings could create up to 700 jobs in the area.
Mayor Joe Anderson said the regeneration would help an area of the city which had ""been in the doldrums for a long time"".
The north Liverpool area has been the subject of proposed regeneration in the past and Mr Anderson said the time residents had had to wait for plans to come to fruition represented a ""shameful period for the city"".
""Too many false dawns have happened and I hope people take comfort from the fact we are seeing tangible results of a determination to make things happen,"" he said.
""We've got to continue that work to make sure the area is regenerated in terms not just of infrastructure but of people as well, making sure it's vibrant again and that people want to live here.""

He added that 296 properties in the area would be removed to make way for the new developments.

"Alongside tents and drinking water, RAF planes dropped more than 1,000 solar-powered lanterns attached to chargers for all types of mobile handsets to the stranded members of the Yazidi religious community below.
It is the first time the lanterns have been airdropped in such a relief effort, but humanitarian workers say it is part of growing efforts to develop technology designed to make a difference in disaster zones.
In 2010, Dr Paul Gardner-Stephen, a computer systems researcher at Flinders University in Australia, was driving to work in his car when he first heard radio reports of the devastation of the Haiti earthquake, more than 10,000 miles away.
With roads blocked, infrastructure reduced to rubble and mobile networks down, he realised something needed to be done, and quickly.
""You typically have about three days to restore the communications before the bad people realise the good people aren't in control any more,"" he says.
His solution was to develop the technology that allows mobile phones to communicate directly with each other even where there is no network coverage, or when mobile masts have been knocked out of action - a system known as ""mesh networking"".
His Serval Project work means users can send text messages, make calls and send files to other users nearby, creating a mobile network through a web of users.
It is just one example of the dozens of technologies developed in the wake of Haiti to help relief efforts in disaster zones.
""There's plenty of technology for rich white men,"" Dr Gardner-Stephen says. ""It's the rest of the world that we need to help.""
Another project born out of the Haiti disaster was the Trilogy Emergency Relief Application (Tera), a mass text messaging programme now being rolled out by the Red Cross in 40 countries around the world.
It allows aid workers to navigate a disaster-hit country from a computer screen, identify all the mobile phones being used in a given area, and blast them all with urgent 140-character updates with a click of a button.
It was first developed in Haiti with the help of local mobile network operators, allowing messages with advice on water sanitation and medical aid to be distributed to millions of people across the Caribbean country.
""I don't know of any other means of communication where you could reach that many people, that quickly and that directly,"" says Sharon Reader, a communications adviser for the International Red Cross currently working on setting up the Tera system in east Africa.
""It's not like the radio when someone has to be switched on and listening. It's a buzz in their pocket and they're going to be able to see that information immediately.""
She says the sheer volume of mobile phones now sold in developing countries makes text messaging the ideal way to communicate.
Global mobile subscriptions are expected to reach seven billion this year according to the UN, with developing countries in Africa and Asia seeing the fastest growth.
The Tera project also allows disaster victims to send messages back to aid agencies, telling them where they are and what they most urgently need.
That makes it similar to other recently developed applications designed to harvest the huge volumes of information generated in the immediate aftermath of a sudden-onset disaster, like a war or earthquake.
The Ushahidi project was used in Haiti to crowd source information from the Haitain population, using social media sources like Twitter and Facebook alongside text messages, with information visualised on an online map for humanitarian agencies to use.
Similar platforms became popular following the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan.
The Japanese are the third biggest users of Twitter in the world, and the network became a crucial communication method and information source, typically faster and more effective than mainstream media.
Several similar projects are being developed, including those through the Digital Humanitarian Network and the Standby Taskforce - organisations that mobilise volunteers with expertise in monitoring social media, translating messages to and from local dialects, and creating crisis maps around disasters.
Kim Scriven is the manager of the Humanitarian Innovation Fund, a government-backed agency set up in 2011 that supports innovative research in humanitarian aid.
He says the trying to harvest and filter the vast amounts of data generated by a disaster or conflict is ""the big nut that people are trying to crack"", with the real challenge being to turn all of that data into information that humanitarian agencies can actually act on.
""There are lots of people working on it, but in my view that hasn't happened yet,"" he says.
Alongside the smaller start-ups typically supported by Mr Scriven's fund, the bigger technology players are beginning to show more interest in humanitarian applications for their technology.
Google recently unveiled its drone programme, which it suggests could be used to airdrop aid into disaster zones.
Last year, the search giant unveiled Project Loon - a plan to deliver internet connections to hard-to-reach places through a network of high-altitude balloons.
Both are in the early stages of development. But aid workers say we are seeing a sea-change in the role of technology in humanitarian relief, and how it can empower those affected by the disaster they find themselves in.
""[Disaster relief] is no longer about just dropping items on people and leaving them to it,"" says the Red Cross's Sharon Reader.
""There has been a huge shift in the aid world in seeing people who are affected by a crisis not as victims but as people who have the capacity to look after themselves.""","Here's a concise summary of the article:

"Adam Isaac, 23, from Merthyr Tydfil, previously admitted eight sexual offences against children.
Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court heard he targeted two boys, aged 12 and 14, and asked them to send intimate photos of themselves.
Judge Richard Twomlow QC said: ""This predatory behaviour is a worry and a concern to parents.""
Isaac admitted causing or inciting child prostitution or pornography, performing sexual acts in the presence of a child, encouraging a child to engage in a sexual activity and the possession of indecent photos of a child.
He committed sexual acts himself while on video calls with the boys and also possessed indecent images of an unidentified third boy.
In a statement to the court, the family of one of the victims said: ""We never believed he could be manipulated in this way after we warned him about the dangers online.
""We are now so scared to allow him online. He has matured so quickly - we are fighting to stop him going down a destructive path and we are trying to get him back to being the child he was.""
A spokesman for children's charity the NSPCC said it was ""every parent's nightmare"".
Minecraft, which has more than 100 million registered users, is a 3D game in which players build their own worlds using cubes, as well as exploring and gathering and crafting resources.
Prosecutor Rachel Knight said: ""The defendant sent money to the boys on PayPal and used the game to groom them.
""The parents of the boys did not know what was happening. In the case of the 12 year old he was playing the game at night while his parents were asleep.""
The court heard the boy's father found his chats on Skype involved an adult asking him about his sex life, so he contacted the police.
Judge Twomlow told Isaac he had gone on to ""an innocent type of game, very far removed from the type of contact you engaged in.
""You knew you would find teenage boys. This was clearly a grooming process.""
Susan Ferrier, defending, said Isaac apologised to the boys and their parents.
""He was subjected to bullying from the age of 12 and is far more comfortable in the online world than the real world,"" she added.
A father of one of the victims said before the case: ""Nobody my son's age would have stood a chance.""
He read 170 pages of chat between the two and described Isaac as ""callous and cold"", adding: ""The way he gained his trust, built the relationship, he was an expert.
""There is no way that any child, once drawn into that world, would ever have seen it coming.""
While he initially felt disbelief, the father now believes any amount of parental training could not have prevented it happening.
He said his son was totally unaware and is finding it hard to cope with the realisation that he was ""calculatedly groomed"".
A spokeswoman for Microsoft said: ""Helping promote a safe online experience has always been a priority for us, particularly when it comes to children.
""We also offer resources to help parents understand how to help keep their kids safe.""
Speaking after the sentence, Barnardo's chief executive Javed Khan said the case ""highlights the need for parents and children to understand the dangers of online gaming.
""Social media and online games like Minecraft are now central to our children's lives but they provide a channel for abusers to easily reach and influence both boys and girls online,"" he said.
""Recent research into children referred to five of Barnardo's specialist services found that nearly two-thirds of children groomed online went on to meet their abuser.
""Parents need to understand the mobile technology their children are using and what they're doing online so they can protect them. And children themselves need to be aware of danger and how to keep themselves safe.""
Lucy Dowdall, senior crown prosecutor for the Crown Prosecution Service Wales Rape and Serious Sexual Offences Unit, said: ""This was a planned and calculated course of action on the part of Isaac and it is right that he has been made to face up to what he did in a criminal court.
""This case serves as another reminder to anyone who has caring responsibilities for children to be alert to online safety matters so that wherever possible, children are prevented from coming into harm's way.

""Literally 10 minutes after I'd sent her my profile I got a message saying 'what would you do if I sent these photos to your friends and family?'"" he said.

"A clever throw-in routine was finished off by Neeskens Kebano's low drive to put DR Congo 1-0 up but Wilfried Bony equalised with a powerful header.
DR Congo regained the lead just two minutes later when Junior Kabananga headed in.
Ivory Coast salvaged a point when Serey Die's 20-yard shot was deflected in.
Salomon Kalou was denied a late winner for Ivory Coast when he volleyed in superbly but the goal was ruled out for offside.
The result leaves Group C congested - at least until Friday's late game between Togo and Morocco.
Ivory Coast teetered on the brink because of some poor defending.
They failed to pick up the runs of Kebano and Kabananga for the DR Congo pair's goals and were also fortunate when Firmin Ndombe Mubele's shot clipped the post after he had easily held off two defenders.
But in Bony they had a serious aerial threat and the on-loan Stoke forward gave a warning when he headed over from a long ball over the top by Serge Aurier. Soon after he powered in a downward header from a corner for his side's first equaliser
The Ivorian's second leveller had an element of good fortune as Die's drive was diverted in off a defender.
A tight offside decision then went against Kalou, who had brilliantly volleyed in from Aurier's free-kick.

It arrived in York an hour later than expected after it was twice held up by reports of people on the line.

"Can you plant, grow and harvest a hectare of spring barley using only robots?
If they pull this off, this small team will be the first in the world to manage such a feat.
But it is not going to be easy.
I was there as they started the project and brought robots to the field for the very first time.
The ground rules are simple.
There's a hectare of land which will be fenced off and only robots and machines will be allowed inside with the odd drone flying overhead.
People are completely forbidden - hence the project nickname, ""The hands free hectare"".
The crop chosen by Harper Adams and Precision Decision Ltd is spring barley, which means after harvest the end result can be used to make robot beer.
So there's everything to play for.
There's a really fascinating argument at the heart of all this.
A modern tractor can drive itself using GPS and decide how much pesticide or fertiliser to apply and where to do it.
In theory making the tractor completely autonomous is the next logical step.
After all that's what is happening with self-driving cars.
But these tractors are also really big.
That means they can crush the soil which reduces yields and their size also limits the accuracy when applying those expensive chemicals.
The alternative is the approach being taken at Harper Adams.
Smaller, lighter, cheaper machines that achieve the same result but leave the soil in better shape and which can tackle weeds and more with pinpoint accuracy.
It's a view that says future farming will involve a flock of smaller robot machines rather than one massive self-driving tractor.
So how likely is all this?
Will we really see driverless tractors quietly moving through fields of wheat and barley?
Well one American report suggested the global market for agricultural robots could be worth Â£13bn by the year 2020.
Here in the UK, the question of who will be working in our fields post-Brexit is bringing a new focus on to the whole issue of automation.
For now the team is waiting for the delivery of the compact tractor that will be doing most of the work from planting to harvest.
Ahead of its arrival they are testing the robot driving system on a smaller machine.
They have three months to get everything right before they face their first big test, planting the barley.
So will the young, nimble team from Shropshire beat some of the world's biggest machinery companies to this extraordinary goal?
An entire farming cycle carried out by robots?
Well we'll be there every step of the way to find out.

"The remains of Catherine Burns, 29, will be returned to Clonoe, near Coalisland, County Tyrone, for reburial in the summer.
A widow, she left her native shores in 1832 with her father-in-law and many others from Tyrone. All hoped for a better life in the land of free.
However, within weeks of arriving, Catherine had disappeared - murdered while working for a US railroad.
She was among 57 Irish labourers hired to build a section of railway between Philadelphia and Columbia, a worksite that would become known as Duffy's Cut.
By the end of August 1832, all the workers were dead. Some perished due to a cholera outbreak, but most were murdered.
There are a number of theories as to why they were killed, including prejudice against Irish Catholics or a fear that they would spread cholera.
Many were buried in a mass grave and forgotten for more than a century. Catherine was buried nearby but the recent discovery of further fragments of her bones has lead to a move to have her remains returned home.
Fr Benny Fee, of St Patrick's Church, Clonoe, will preside over her funeral Mass on 19 July following her repatriation.
He said her story ""touches our history with people leaving Ireland for America and their hopes and desires"".
""Not everyone found its streets were paved with gold.""
Emigration from Ireland began as early as 1603.
However, the period of greatest emigration began about 1780 and reached its peak from 1845 to 1855, when it is thought between one and two million people left Ireland because of the potato famine.
Fr Fee said: ""There's a poignancy in it of this lovely girl who went to America hoping for a new home, a new life after her husband died, but in the words of the Christy Moore song about Duffy's Cut, she went 'into hell'.
""She was one of the few females on the ship, that's how they were able to identify her.
""She was apparently bound and died from a blow with a sharp instrument.""
Duffy's Cut and its story have been brought to light over the past 12 years by brothers Frank and William Watson, a Lutheran minister and a historian at Immaculata University.
They have led a team trying to uncover what happened to those 57 workers who hail from such places as Donegal, Tyrone and Derry.
Dr Frank Watson said they had used an old railroad file inherited from their grandfather to glean information.
After the mass grave was found in 2009, they sought to have the site excavated, remains identified and the cause of the emigrants' deaths determined.
""We have now recovered six bodies and reburied five in West Lauer Hill cemetery in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania in 2012, along with one in Ardara in Donegal in 2013 (John Ruddy),"" he said.
""All of those recovered to this date were murdered by blunt force trauma, and one was both axed and shot in the head. None of the murdered show defensive wounds, indicating that they may have been tied up prior to being murdered.
""On July 19 my brother Bill, Earl, and I will be travelling to Clonoe, Tyrone, to bury remains of the woman that were uncovered at Duffy's Cut named Catherine Burns (born around 1803) .""
In a further tragic twist to Catherine's story, no-one has been able to trace her family because they do not know her maiden name.
Fr Fee is also unaware of any of her relatives living in the area.
He said: ""It is a cause for reflection that this lady is coming back to Tyrone. It will be a privilege to conduct the funeral.

"Libya was under foreign rule for centuries until it gained independence in 1951. Soon after oil was discovered and earned the country immense wealth.
Col Gaddafi seized power in 1969 and ruled for four decades until he was toppled in 2011 following an armed rebellion assisted by Western military intervention.
In recent years the country has been a key springboard for migrants heading for Europe. Concerns have also been raised over the rise of Islamist militancy there.
Population 6.4 million

The toppling of long-term leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 led to a power vacuum and instability, with no authority in full control.
The National Transitional Council (NTC), a rebel leadership council which had fought to oust the Gaddafi government, declared Libya ''liberated'' in October 2011 and took over the running of the country.
However, it struggled to impose order on the many armed militia that had become active in the months leading up to the ouster of Gaddafi.
In August 2012 the NTC handed power to the General National Congress (GNC), an elected parliament which went on to select an interim head of state.
Voters chose a new parliament to replace the GNC in June 2014 - the Council of Representatives (CoR), which relocated to the eastern city of Tobruk, leaving Tripoli controlled by powerful militia groups.
The Islamic State extremist militia took advantage of the conflict between forces loyal to the outgoing GNC and the new parliament to gain control of several coastal cities, including Derna and Sirte.
Late in 2015, the UN brokered an agreement to form a new ""unity"" government - the Presidency Council, headed by unity Prime Minister Fayez Sarraj - but both Tripoli and Tobruk administrations were reluctant to acknowledge its authority.
Mr Sarraj and some of his deputies finally arrived in Tripoli in March 2016 and set up their headquarters in a heavily-guarded naval base.
Libya's media environment is highly-polarised and virtually unregulated, reflecting the country's political instability.
Satellite TV is a key news source and many outlets are based outside Libya.
Journalism is fraught with danger; reporters face threats and attacks.
Islamic State group operates its own media from its stronghold, Sirte.
Some key dates in Libya's history:
7th century BC - Phoenicians settle in Tripolitania in western Libya, which was hitherto populated by Berbers.
4th century BC - Greeks colonise Cyrenaica in the east of the country, which they call Libya.
74 BC - Romans conquer Libya.
AD 643 - Arabs conquer Libya and spread Islam.
16th century - Libya becomes part of the Ottoman Empire, which joins the three provinces of Tripolitania, Cyrenaica and Fezzan into one regency in Tripoli.
1911-12 - Italy seizes Libya from the Ottomans. Omar al-Mukhtar begins 20-year insurgency against Italian rule.
1942 - Allies oust Italians from Libya, which is then divided between the French and the British.
1951 - Libya becomes independent under King Idris al-Sanusi.
1969 - Col Muammar Gaddafi, aged 27, deposes the king in a bloodless military coup.
1992 - UN imposes sanctions on Libya over the bombing of a PanAm airliner over the Scottish town of Lockerbie in December 1988.
2011 - Violent protests break out in Benghazi and spread to other cities. This leads to civil war, foreign intervention and eventually the ouster and killing of Gaddafi.
2016 - Following years of conflict, a new UN-backed ""unity"" government is installed in a naval base in Tripoli. It faces opposition from two rival governments and a host of militias.","Here's a concise summary of Libya's history:

So what useful apps that could help you take back control of your life?
Fed up of washing and ironing? Try a laundry app such as FlyCleaners in New York, or Laundrapp, available in UK cities such as London, Glasgow and Harrogate.
The FlyCleaners app is free to use and offers an overnight service for when you need clean clothes fast.
Just pick a slot and hand your washing over to a FlyCleaners representative as little as 20 minutes later.
Washing and pressing one shirt in Chelsea, Manhattan costs $2.99 (Â£2.34), and deliveries are free when you spend more than $30 (Â£23).
With Laundrapp, booking the 48-hour service is also free, while prices depend on your location and the load.
Getting five shirts washed and pressed in south London, for example, costs Â£11.
Organising who does what around the house can be a chore in itself, but with US firm FamilyTech's apps Mothershp and Choremonster, you can set jobs for each member of the family from your office.
FamilyTech co-founder Chris Bergman says: ""With Mothershp, parents set chores and rewards. Their child then logs into Choremonster, where they can earn rewards such as 'screen time', and unlock monsters, for completing those chores.""
Both apps are free to use and are available worldwide in eight languages.
Wherever you live, you can use your lunch hour to plan evening meals using a home cooking app such as BigOven.
Features on the free app, which is available around the world, include a grocery list organiser and more than 350,000 recipes.
If you want access to money-saving tips and nutrition tools, you can also sign up for the ""Pro"" version costing $19.99 a year or $1.99 a month.
Once you've planned your meal, you could order the ingredients from independent retailers using a locally focused app such as Epicery. It launched a one-hour delivery service in Paris last year.
Deliveries cost from â¬2.90 (Â£2.46) up to â¬6.90 (Â£5.89) if you order produce from three or more of its 250 members, which include local butchers, fishmongers and off-licences.
""Our aim is to expand into several other French and European cities soon,"" says Doriane Raffin at Epicery.
Then if you have food left over, why not ""freecycle"" it, rather than throw it away, using a UK-based app like Olio? It enables families and local business owners to redistribute food and other household items that would otherwise go to waste.
The free app is a hit with Ms Wong, 40.
""Food waste drives me mad, so I love Olio,"" she says.
Free 360-degree virtual reality (VR) tours are the new way to plan your next holiday from your desk.
All you need is your smartphone and the website of a VR specialist such as Ascape VR or YouVisit and you can escape into another world on your lunch break (with or without a VR headset).
Valeriy Kondruk, chief executive of Ascape VR, says: ""Working in an office, you spend 90% of your time reading and writing.
""Taking a virtual trip is a great way to switch off and really get personal with a destination.""
With online marketplace TaskRabbit you can tackle all those odd jobs you never seem to have enough time to do, from clearing the loft to fixing that leaky tap. Simply choose a ""tasker"" based on experience, reputation and hourly rate.
Once the job is done, pay securely via the app, which is currently available in 23 cities across the US, as well as in London.
Elsewhere, ServisHero is one of the most popular apps for Singapore residents in need of a handyman.
Its users describe what needs doing, wait for the quotes to roll in, and then pick a ""hero"" to do the job.
You can find fun family activities in minutes with free apps such as the UK's Hoop and Yuggler in the US.
Hoop users can set filters to find nearby events that suit their children, and can share those they find interesting with their friends.
""I use Hoop to do last-minute planning on where to take the kids,"" Ms Wong says.
Yuggler, which is only currently available on iOS devices, offers similar features in US cities including San Francisco and Philadelphia. It is planning to expand into 22 more cities soon.
Apps such as DocTap and iCliniq offer a way for busy professionals to get medical advice without taking time off.
ICliniq users can set up a video consultation with one of its 2,000 or so doctors in countries including the US, India and Germany.
And with London-based DocTap, you can pay Â£24 for 15-minute face-to-face GP appointments at clinics and pharmacies around the UK capital.

"Until now, the app had focused on offering singles a way to find dates.
Its chief told the BBC that the move marked the ""first step that we're taking to make Tinder more social and a little broader when it comes to the types of connections we want to enable"".
But one expert said Tinder Social might be seen as a group sex feature.
""Tinder is seen by many as being a hook-up site,"" commented Ben Wood from the CCS Insight consultancy.
""So, it needs to be careful. By expanding in this direction, rather than becoming a more interesting social meeting service, it could be perceived as an orgy app.""
Tinder's chief executive Sean Rad, however, stressed that it was not about targeting this ""niche"" activity.
""It definitely allows you to make connections beyond just romantic ones,"" he explained.
""We look at Tinder as not just being a dating app, but capturing your entire social life. And your social life has so many different aspects to it.
""The beauty of putting this in the same app is that we have scale - we have tens of millions of users all over the world.
""So, overnight you can get the power of Tinder and connect with others going out tonight in a way that was never possible.""
Tinder is owned by InterActiveCorp (IAC), a New York-based business that also owns the dating site Match.com, the search service Ask, and The Daily Beast news site.
It says that 85% of Tinder's users are between the ages of 18 to 34, and that the app has already led to more than 11 billion matches since it launched in 2012.
An earlier version of Tinder Social was tested earlier this year in Australia. It is now being rolled out in the UK, US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and India.
To use it, users must first opt in to the feature within the existing app.
Then they need to:
Users can then see other groups. If a member from both sides ""swipes right"" to pick the other, members can then make the necessary arrangements via a group chat feature.
As a security measure, users may leave a group at any time. Furthermore, the next day, the group chat expires, and individual members need to like each other to stay in contact, assuming they have not already swapped other contact details.
For the moment, Tinder Social is completely free to use.
But Mr Rad suggested his firm could make money by adding premium features, which users would need to have a Tinder Plus account to access.
Tinder Plus currently costs ÃÂ£3.99 for under-28s and ÃÂ£14.99 for older users, allowing them to look at members they had initially rejected and see people who live in other parts of the world.

""We are here for the man in Bosnia, years after rape, still stigmatised, unable to earn enough money to buy bread for his family.
""We are here for all the forgotten, hidden survivors who have been made to feel ashamed or been abandoned.
""And for the children of rape - we want the whole world to hear their stories and understand that this injustice cannot be tolerated, and that sorrow and compassion are not enough.""

She said she hoped they would not only be ""forced to act, but that they will also deeply want to and be moved and be committed"".

"The markings show a beast, crescent, comb and mirror.
Archaeologist Cait McCullagh said it was a mystery how it had taken until this year for the stone to be officially recorded.
She said it also suggested that more Pictish stones have still to be documented on the Black Isle where the beast was recorded.
Ms McCullagh, the co-founder and director of Archaeology for Communities in the Highlands (Arch), said the symbol stones probably dated from the 5th to 7th centuries AD.
She said it was unusual to find such carvings on the north side of the Moray Firth.
A lack of weathering on the Pictish beast may suggest the stone had been kept inside, or had been buried, for a long period before it was placed in the wall of the byre.
Isobel Henderson, an expert in the field of early medieval sculpture, came across the Pictish beast stone earlier this year and alerted Highland Council archaeologists.
Easter Ross-based Ms McCullagh was also notified and she confirmed the markings as Pictish.
She also went on to identify a Pictish symbol stone in the wall of a nearby farmhouse with markings thought to represent goose feathers, or fish scales. Harling obscures most the carving.
Both stones are on private properties built in the 19th Century and owned by the same family for about 50 years until two years ago.
Ms McCullagh said the relics were never mentioned during a recent local heritage project that had asked people to suggest sites of archaeological and historical interest.
The Pictish beast and goose, or fish, markings have been recorded by Highland Council's Historic Environment Record.
Ms McCullagh said: ""It is a mystery why it has taken so long for the stones to come to our attention.
""It is also exciting to think that there are maybe more still to be found.

"The finding potentially delays at least two executions and could influence court challenges in other states.
It comes as US states are having increasing trouble obtaining drugs used in executions, amid an embargo from European pharmaceutical firms.
Critics say the states risk botching executions with impure drugs.
In January, an execution in Ohio took 25 minutes to complete, as the inmate reportedly gasped and made choking noises in the moments before he was pronounced dead.
The state used two untried drugs to kill convicted murderer and rapist Dennis McGuire after the maker of the previous execution drug refused to allow its use.
The challenge to Oklahoma's law was brought by convicted murderers Clayton Lockett and Charles Warner, who sought to learn the source of the drugs to be used in their executions scheduled for 22 April and 29 April, respectively.
But Oklahoma state law blocks officials from revealing - even during court proceedings - the identities of the companies supplying the drugs used to sedate the inmates, paralyse their respiratory systems, and stop their hearts.
On Wednesday, Oklahoma County district court Judge Patricia Parrish ruled the secrecy provision unconstitutional, though her ruling did not affect Lockett's and Warner's death sentences.
""I think that the secrecy statute is a violation of due process because access to the courts has been denied,"" Ms Parrish ruled, according to local media reports.
It's getting harder for US states to source the drugs used in lethal injections because many European companies don't want their drugs used for this purpose, the BBC's Beth McLeod in Washington reports.
State governments have turned to other suppliers, but lawyers for death row inmates argue that these less regulated drugs can lack purity and cause unnecessary suffering, our correspondent reports.
Capital punishment experts say the Oklahoma decision could affect the several other states where corrections officials are barred by law from disclosing the source of the drugs.
Thirty-two US states have death penalty laws and 18, plus the District of Columbia, have abolished capital punishment.
But in recent years only a handful of states have actually carried out executions - nine in 2013 and seven in 2012.
The annual number of executions has fallen dramatically, from a high of 98 in 1999 to 39 last year.","Here's a concise summary of the article:

"Marc Traylor, 42, of Hersden, near Canterbury, stabbed his 16-year-old daughter with two kitchen knives.
Jurors heard Mr Traylor, who had paranoid schizophrenia, had stopped taking his medication after being allowed to self-medicate.
He had denied the charge at Canterbury Crown Court.
During the trial, a firearms officer told the court Mr Traylor's daughter had been in ""imminent danger"" on the day of the attack on 9 February.
He told jurors he saw Mr Traylor stab the girl several times and she was screaming with the blows.
The officer said he realised her life was in danger and shot Mr Traylor three times.
Mr Traylor was shot once in the chest and twice in the head by officers.
Kent Police said Mr Traylor was incapacitated by the third shot.
One officer had already fired a Taser which missed and the officer who fired the bullets also fired his Taser first but it too missed, the court heard.
Both Mr Traylor and his daughter, who has since recovered, were taken to hospital after the attack.
He remains in hospital where he needs help to eat, drink and walk.
The court heard Mr Traylor had twice been detained under the Mental Health Act.
After the hearing, Det Ch Insp Nick Gossett said he hoped the verdict would bring ""some closure to all parties involved"".
He added: ""Equally, Mr Traylor will be able to get the medical support that he needs at a secure hospital.""
The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), which investigated the incident, said Kent Police's use of force, including the discharge of a hand gun and Tasers, was proportionate given the threat to life.
""Negotiations and risk assessments conducted by officers were appropriate,"" an IPCC spokesman added.
He said IPCC recommendations, which have been accepted by Kent Police, included the force should consider modifying Taser training to incorporate scenarios with third parties, complete work to draft and approve its policy on negotiations, and review training to ensure effective information sharing by front line and armed officers at incidents.
Following the court case, Mr Traylor's defence solicitor Sean Caulfield said the families of people with paranoid schizophrenia needed support and access to help, and those with the condition needed regular checks.
""Sadly, the Traylor family has suffered the life-changing consequences of a lapse in this care and Mr Traylor may now have to live in a supported unit for the rest of his life due to events of that night,"" he said.
He said Mr Traylor had the support of his family who understood he could not be held responsible for his actions.
Kent and Medway NHS and Social Care Partnership Trust said patients wished to have as fully independent lives as possible and part of their rehabilitation included self-administering medication.

"It is thought the actress will make her last appearance as Clara Oswald before the Christmas special, which sees the return of Alex Kingston as River Song.
Coleman joined Doctor Who in 2012, and has starred alongside two Doctors, Matt Smith and Peter Capaldi.
The Mirror reports that her next role will be as Queen Victoria in a major ITV drama series.
The 29-year-old, who began her career in the soap opera Emmerdale, is expected to play the Queen from the age of 18 and in the early years of her reign.
However, ITV said it was not making ""any announcements about casting presently"".
The BBC has also declined to confirm Coleman's departure from Doctor Who.
In an interview published in the Radio Times this week, the actress said she had always known her time on the show was finite.
""You're in Doctor Who knowing it will never last,"" she said.
""It's constantly regenerating, so you want to make your time count and enjoy the adventure for the fleeting time you're here.""
ITV announced in May they would be making an eight-part series about the life of Queen Victoria.
It is being made by the producers of Poldark and has been created and written by the novelist Daisy Goodwin.
Filming starts this month and it is understood that Coleman has already filmed her final scenes for Doctor Who, which returns to BBC One on Saturday.
Rumours of the star's departure circulated last year, after a cliffhanger in the series eight finale, Death In Heaven.
Fans had to wait until the end of the Christmas Day special to find out whether Coleman's character would return.
Chief writer Steven Moffat later confirmed the actress had initially asked to be written out of the drama.
""That was her last episode,"" he said. ""Then she asked me if she could be in [the] Christmas [episode]. So I said, 'OK, I'll write you out in Christmas.'""
""She came to the read through and did the 'write out' version - and again changed her mind.""
""But the truth is I never wanted her to go. And with Last Christmas, I'd already written the alternative version where she stayed, and I preferred that version.

"An experiment located in the bottom of a gold mine in South Dakota, US, could offer the best chance yet of detecting dark matter.
Scientists believe this substance makes up more than a quarter of the cosmos, yet no-one has ever seen it directly.
Early results from this detector, which is called LUX, confirmed it was the most powerful experiment of its kind.
In the coming weeks, it will begin a 300-day-long run that could provide the first direct evidence of these enigmatic particles.
Spotting WIMPs
Beneath the snow-covered Black Hills of South Dakota, a cage rattles and creaks as it begins to descend into the darkness.
For more than 100 years, this was the daily commute for the Homestake miners searching for gold buried deep in the rocks.
Today, the subterranean caverns and tunnels have been transformed into a high-tech physics laboratory.
Scientists now make the 1.5km (1-mile) journey underground in an attempt to solve one of the biggest mysteries in science.
""We've moved into the 21st Century, and we still do not know what most of the matter in the Universe is made of,"" says Prof Rick Gaitskell, from Brown University in Rhode Island, one of the principle investigators on Large Underground Xenon (LUX) experiment.
Scientists believe all of the matter we can see - planets, stars, dust and so on - only makes up a tiny fraction of what is actually out there.
They say about 85% of the matter in the Universe is actually dark matter, so called because it cannot be seen directly and nobody really knows what it is.
This has not stopped physicists coming up with ideas though. And the most widely supported theory is that dark matter takes the form of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, or WIMPs.
Prof Gaitskell explains: ""If one considers the Big Bang, 14bn years ago, the Universe was very much hotter than it is today and created an enormous number of particles.
""The hypothesis we are working with at the moment is that a WIMP was the relic left-over from the Big Bang, and in fact dominates over the regular material you and I are made of.""
The presence of dark matter was first inferred because of its effect on galaxies like our own.
As these celestial systems rotate around their dense centre, all of the regular matter that they contain does not have enough mass to account for the gravity needed to hold everything together.  Really, a spinning galaxy should fly apart.
Instead, scientists believe that dark matter provides the extra mass, and therefore gravity, needed to hold a galaxy together.
It is so pervasive throughout the Universe that researchers believe a vast number of WIMPs are streaming through the Earth every single second. Almost all pass through without a trace.
However, on very rare occasions, it is thought that dark matter particles do bump into regular matter - and it is this weak interaction that scientists are hoping to see.
The LUX detector is one of a number of physics experiments based in the Sanford Underground Research Facility that require a ""cosmic quietness"".
Prof Gaitskell says: ""The purpose of the mile of rock above is to deal with cosmic rays. These are high-energy particles generated from outside our Solar System and also by the Sun itself, and these are very penetrating.
""If we don't put a mile of rock between us and space, we wouldn't be able to do this experiment.""
Inside a cavern in the mine, the detector is situated inside a stainless steel tank that is two storeys high.
This is filled with about 300,000 litres (70,000 gallons) of ultra-purified water, which means it is free from traces of naturally occurring radioactive elements that could also interfere with the results.
""With LUX, we've worked extremely hard to make this the quietest verified place in the world,"" says Prof Gaitskell.
At the detector's heart is 370kg (815lb) of liquid xenon. This element has the unusual, but very useful, property of throwing out a flash of light when particles bump into it.
And detecting a series of these bright sparks could mean that dark matter has been found.
The LUX detector was first turned on last year for a 90-day test run. No dark matter was seen, but the results concluded that it was the most sensitive experiment of its kind.
Now, when the experiment is run for 300 days, Prof Gaitskell says these interactions might be detected once a month or every few months.
The team would have to see a significant number of interactions -  between five and 10 - to suggest that dark matter has really been glimpsed. The more that are seen, the more statistical confidence there will be.
However, LUX is not the only experiment setting its sights on dark matter.
With the Large Hadron Collider, scientists are attempting to create dark matter as they smash particles together, and in space, telescopes are searching for the debris left behind as dark matter particles crash into each other.
Mike Headley, director of the South Dakota Science and Technology Authority, which runs the Sanford laboratory, says a Nobel prize will very probably be in store for the scientists who first detect dark matter.
He says: ""There are a handful of experiments located at different underground laboratories around the world that want to be the first ones to stand up and say 'we have discovered it', and so it is very competitive.""
Finding dark matter would transform our understanding of the Universe, and usher in a new era in fundamental physics.
However, there is also a chance that it might not be spotted - and the theory of dark matter is wrong.
Dr Jim Dobson, based at the UK's University of Edinburgh and affiliated with University College London, says: ""We are going into unknown territory. We really don't know what we're going to find.
""If we search with this experiment and then the next experiment, LUX Zeppelin, which is this much, much bigger version of LUX - if we didn't find anything then there would be a good chance it didn't exist.
He adds: ""In some ways, showing that there was no dark matter would be a more interesting result than if there was. But, personally, I would rather we found some.""
Prof Carlos Frenk, a cosmologist from Durham University, says that many scientists have gambled decades of research on finding dark matter.
He adds: ""If I was a betting man, I think LUX is the frontrunner. It has the sensitivity we need.  Now, we just need the data.
""If they don't [find it], it means the dark matter is not what we think it is. It would mean I have wasted my whole scientific career - everything I have done is based on the hypothesis that the Universe is made of dark matter. It would mean we had better look for something else.""

On the possibility of a surprise signing, the Dutchman added: ""He is in the process. It is not a striker that the media has written but you have to wait and see.""
Van Gaal was speaking before the second game of United's United States tour against MLS side San Jose Earthquakes (04:00 BST, Wednesday).
Rooney last operated as a main striker in the 2011-12 campaign, when he scored 34 goals, his equal-highest personal haul.
""I hope to score 20 or more goals again,"" said Rooney.
""If I'm playing as a striker, then I will be disappointed if I can't do that again.
""I've played different roles over the years for United but you only have to look when I play for England as a striker I score goals.""

However, De Gea is expected to be available to play against Barcelona on Saturday.
On whether he is worried Rooney is risking injury playing for Everton against Villarreal in Duncan Ferguson's testimonial on 2 August:
""He can also fall off the stairs.""
On Rooney's first season as captain in 2014-15:
""I could not expect more. He is a great captain. Better than I had expected. He is fully accepted by the players. That is also very important. I can choose but the players decide. The players have to accept the captain.""
On being more comfortable approaching his second season in charge:
""Yes. I could not say that last year. You always have to be positive about your selection as a manager but the difference now is that we already have four new players and we are training with them on the tour. That is a big difference.
""But the biggest difference is the balance in the team. Last year on the USA tour I have to line up players in different positions than they are used to playing. That is not good. Now I have two players for every position.""
On a huge turnover of players:
""We have sold a lot of players. More than 17 in my period. I never talked about that but it is true. It is normal in the football world. You have to improve the selection every year and also keep them fresh. Also a new player can give a great stimulus.""

"There are fewer than 36,000 speakers of Inuktitut in Canada and the numbers are falling, especially among young people.
Robert Watt is one of 17 members of the Inuit community visiting Wales to learn about how Welsh is promoted.
Mr Watt planned to ask the Prince to write to the Canadian government during a royal visit to Carmarthen on Friday.
Inuktitut is one of more than 60 indigenous languages in Canada, but it is not recognised by the government officially.
The group, representing all Canadian Inuit, the Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, was sent to Wales to learn about the Welsh government's goal of having more than a million Welsh speakers in Wales by 2050.
Rights campaigner Mr Watt, who is from an Inuit community in northern Quebec, said he hoped to ask the Prince if he could write a letter endorsing their cause.
""The Welsh language is encouraged and supported through the Welsh Government,"" he said.
""In Canada only French and English are officially recognised.
""We need to somehow get our governments to recognise our languages so we can get the funding to get on with the work that we need to do.""
The group, which is also considering ways to standardise Inuktitut's nine different writing systems, met First Minister Carwyn Jones and Welsh Language commissioner Meri Huws on Thursday.
Canada's national Inuit language coordinator, Monica Ittusardjuat, said she would like to see their education system changed after seeing how Welsh is taught.
In her community of Igloolik, a hamlet of around 2,000 people living above the Arctic Circle, children are taught in Inuktitut until the age of eight when the curriculum changes to English.
""For Inuktitut, we would like to see an education system like in Wales where children can learn in Welsh from day care right through to university,"" she said.
""It's takes time to develop the learning materials and so on, but seeing it happen here we know we can get there one day.""
Andrew Hawke, editor of the the University of Wales Dictionary of the Welsh Language, said the decline of Inuktitut put the difficulties faced by Welsh in perspective.
The 2011 census reported a drop in the number of Welsh speakers from 582,000 in 2001 to 562,000 - about one in five of the population.
Traditional Welsh-speaking communities have been said to be under threat from young people moving away to find work and new housing developments attracting incomers who do not speak the language.
""It's pretty remarkable that the Inuit language has survived at all really, so I think we can consider ourselves very lucky in Wales that we have as many speakers as have,"" he said.

"The computing giant said software vulnerabilities hoarded by governments had caused ""widespread damage"".
The latest virus exploits a flaw in a version of Microsoft Windows first identified by US intelligence.
There are fears of further ""ransomware"" attacks as people return to work on Monday.
Many firms have had experts working over the weekend to prevent new infections. The virus took control of users' files and demanded $300 (ÃÂ£230) payments to restore access.
The spread of the virus slowed over the weekend but the respite might only be brief, experts have warned. More than 200,000 computers have been affected so far.
A statement from Microsoft president and chief legal officer Brad Smith on Sunday criticised the way governments store up information about security flaws in computer systems.
""We have seen vulnerabilities stored by the CIA show up on WikiLeaks, and now this vulnerability stolen from the NSA has affected customers around the world,"" he wrote.
""An equivalent scenario with conventional weapons would be the US military having some of its Tomahawk missiles stolen.""
He added: ""The governments of the world should treat this attack as a wake-up call.""
Microsoft said it had released a Windows security update in March to tackle the problem involved in the latest attack, but many users were yet to run it.
""As cybercriminals become more sophisticated, there is simply no way for customers to protect themselves against threats unless they update their systems,"" Mr Smith said.
There are going to be some tough questions on Monday for those institutions which didn't do enough to keep their networks secure, as well as the organisations that were best placed to stop it happening in the first place - the NSA and Microsoft.
The NSA keeps a chest of cyberweapons to itself so it can hit targets, but Microsoft has long argued that this is dangerous. If there is a flaw in Windows, the company said, surely the safest thing to do is to let its team know straight away so it can be fixed.
But then Microsoft also needs to consider what obligation it has to update all users - not just the ones who pay extra for security on older systems.
Updating your computer if you're an individual is a piece of cake, but for a network the size of Britain's National Health Service? Tough - time-consuming, expensive and complex.
For a company like Microsoft to say it won't keep those systems safe unless they shell out more money, then that in itself is something of a ransom.
Meanwhile Europol's chief told the BBC that that the ransomware was designed to allow ""infection of one computer to quickly spread across the networks"", adding: ""That's why we're seeing these numbers increasing all the time.""
Although a temporary fix earlier slowed the infection rate, the attackers had now released a new version of the virus, he said.
A UK security researcher known as ""MalwareTech"", who helped to limit the ransomware attack, predicted ""another one coming... quite likely on Monday"".
MalwareTech, who wants to remain anonymous, was hailed as an ""accidental hero"" after registering a domain name to track the spread of the virus, which actually ended up halting it.
Becky Pinkard, from Digital Shadows, a UK-based cyber-security firm, told AFP news agency that it would be easy for the initial attackers or ""copy-cat authors"" to change the virus code so it is difficult to guard against.
""Even if a fresh attack does not materialise on Monday, we should expect it soon afterwards,"" she said.
In England, 48 National Health Service (NHS) trusts reported problems at hospitals, doctor surgeries or pharmacies, and 13 NHS organisations in Scotland were also affected.

There are new entries for indie rockers Wild Beasts, whose fourth album Boy King debuts at nine; and emo band Moose Blood, who make their first appearance in the Top 40 with Blush, at number 10.
Elvis Presley's final studio recordings, compiled under the title Way Down in The Jungle Room, enter the chart at 16; while Dinosaur Jr's first album in four years, Give a Glimpse of What Yer Not, is new at 23.
It's not such good news for US producer DJ Khaled, whose latest album, Major Key, tumbles 27 places after debuting at number seven last week.
The singles chart is largely static, with most of the Top 10 shuffling down a place to accommodate Justin Bieber's new entry at two.
However, there are two major exceptions: Twenty One Pilots jump from 20 to nine with the glitchy ballad Heathens, taken from the Suicide Squad soundtrack.
And Chainsmokers' collaboration with US pop sensation Halsey, Closer, leaps from 33 to 12 - giving Halsey her first top 20 single in the UK.

"In future, families will be allowed two children if one parent is an only child, the Xinhua news agency said.
The proposal follows this week's meeting of a key decision-making body of the governing Communist Party.
Other reforms include the abolition of ""re-education through labour"" camps and moves to boost the role of the private sector in the economy.
By Celia HattonBBC News, Beijing
Though the scale of the Chinese leadership's new social and economic reforms are vast, affecting millions across China, none of these changes should come as a shock. Many of these changes have been discussed in the Chinese state media in the past, and many have been test-driven on a smaller scale in different parts of the country.
For example, in some Chinese cities for the past few years, couples who are both single children have been allowed the option of having a second child. The latest change will give couples the option of having two children if just one of the parents is an only child.
Similarly, Chinese President Xi Jinping vowed to abolish the much-hated ""re-education through labour"" system when he first came to power. Quietly, officials have been winding down the system over the past few months.
The Communist government is not prone to making rash decisions. In order to gain the consensus it needs to carry out its plans at the local level, officials need to announce them well ahead of time. Surprises aren't popular in China, it seems.
The BBC's Celia Hatton, in Beijing, says most of the changes have already been tested in parts of the country.
Officials announce their plans well in advance to gain the consensus they need, she adds.
The latest announcements are contained in a 22,000-word document released three days after the Third Plenum meeting of the Communist leadership in Beijing.
Traditionally reforms are expected from the Third Plenum, because new leaders are seen as having had time to consolidate power. President Xi Jinping took office last year.
The one-child policy would be ""adjusted and improved step by step to promote 'long-term balanced development of the population in China'"", Xinhua said.
China introduced its one-child policy at the end of the 1970s to curb rapid population growth.
But correspondents say the policy has become increasingly unpopular and that leaders fear the country's ageing population will both reduce the labour pool and exacerbate elderly care issues.
By 2050, more than a quarter of the population will be over 65.
The one-child policy has on the whole been strictly enforced, though some exceptions already exist, including for ethnic minorities.
In some cities, both parents must be only children in order to be allowed to have a second child.
Chinese netizens hail one-child-policy move
In the countryside, families are allowed to have two children if the first is a girl.
Couples who flout the rules can face heavy fines, or possibly lose their property or their jobs.
Rights groups say the law has meant some women being coerced into abortions, which Beijing denies.
The traditional preference for boys has also created a gender imbalance as some couples opt for sex-selective abortions.
By the end of the decade, demographers say China will have 24 million ""leftover men"" who, because of China's gender imbalance, will not be able to find a wife.
Most of the elderly in China are still cared for by relatives, and only children from single-child parents face what is known as the 4-2-1 phenomenon.
When the child reaches working age, he or she could have to care for two parents and four grandparents in retirement.
On Tuesday, when the Third Plenum ended, China's leaders also promised that the free market would play a bigger role, and farmers would have greater property rights over their land.
By 2050 more than a quarter of China's population will be over 65 years old and younger generations face an unprecedented burden of care.
Ageing China: Changes and challenges
State firms will be required to pay larger dividends to the government, while private firms will be given a greater role in the economy.
There will be greater liberalisation in both interest rates and the free convertibility of the yuan. More overseas investment will be allowed.
There will also be an increase in the number of smaller banks and financial institutions funded by private capital.
Xinhua said the decision to do away with the ""re-education through labour"" camps was ""part of efforts to improve human rights and judicial practices"".
China's leaders had previously said they wanted to reform the system.
The network of camps created half a century ago holds tens of thousands of inmates.
Police panels have the power to sentence offenders to years in camps without trial.
Other reforms announced on Friday include a reduction in the number of crimes subject to the death penalty.","Here's a concise summary of the article:

"In 1988, Pitchfork admitted raping and murdering two 15-year-old girls, Lynda Mann and Dawn Ashworth, after his DNA matched samples found at the scene of both crimes.
The former baker was caught after the world's first mass screening for DNA, in which 5,000 men in three villages in Leicestershire were asked to volunteer blood or saliva samples; he'd initially evaded capture by getting a friend to take the test for him.
As Pitchfork approaches the end of his 28-year minimum jail term, the ITV drama-documentary, Code of a Killer, was a timely reminder of the debt we owe to the inventor of DNA, Professor Sir Alec Jeffreys, and Detective Chief Superintendent David Baker, the investigating officer who had the determination and courage to ensure the technique was applied in the case.
Now, of course, DNA evidence is almost taken for granted.
But over the past two years the operation of the database, and the techniques underpinning it, have altered dramatically in a way that is only just beginning to be understood.
In 2013, as part of the Protection of Freedoms Act, the database was pruned in order to remove the details of innocent people - 1.7 million profiles of children and of adults who hadn't been convicted of any crime were deleted.
That Act was the result of a battle by civil liberty campaigners and others after the European Court of Human Rights ruled in 2008 that the then UK Government's ""blanket and indiscriminate"" policy of storing DNA profiles indefinitely failed to strike ""a fair balance"" between an individual's right to privacy and the state's interest in tackling crime.
Under the Act, a complicated system of retention rules was introduced to differentiate between adults and those under 18; between people who have been cautioned or convicted and those who haven't; and between low-level offences and crimes such as burglary, rape, murder and terrorism.
The new arrangements are so convoluted that even the man responsible for overseeing them, Alastair MacGregor, the Biometrics Commissioner, has cast doubt as to whether they can work effectively and fairly.
In a little-publicised report in December 2014, Mr MacGregor says compliance with the regime, by programming the Police National Computer so that DNA profiles are retained and deleted as they should be, is ""an impossible task"".
He says ""thousands of profiles"" that should have been deleted are retained on the database and about 30 have been inadvertently removed.
Kerri Allen, a DNA specialist who used to work for the Forensic Science Service, is also concerned about the new system.
""It's immensely complicated,"" she says. ""The administration involved in removing a profile is far greater than you might imagine.
""I don't know if it's workable.""
Of course, it may take time for the new procedures to bed in: there were always likely to be bumps on the road.
But Mr MacGregor has further concerns - about the use of DNA profiles from foreign offenders.
It seems that various legislative hurdles are blocking police forces from holding profiles from foreign nationals known to have committed offences overseas, a problem that may also affect some offenders convicted in Scotland and Northern Ireland.
It's an ""unsatisfactory state of affairs,"" he writes, ""which might well be putting the UK public at unnecessary risk.""
The new Home Secretary, whoever it is after 7 May, will surely take note.
The other key development is the scientific method now used to obtain DNA profiles.
It is known as DNA 17, because it looks at 17 areas of a person's DNA.
In July 2014, it replaced the previous technique, SGM+, which examined 11 areas, bringing England and Wales in line with other European countries, though Scotland is already now moving to an advanced version - DNA 24.
DNA 17 is a more sensitive test than its predecessor, which means it is possible to produce a profile from smaller, poorer quality and older cell samples.
It provides the tantalising prospect of helping police to solve crimes, particularly ""cold cases"", previously thought to be impossible to crack.
But among the forensic scientific community there are growing doubts about DNA 17's usefulness in criminal trials.
""DNA 17 is a victim of its own sensitivity,"" says Duncan Woods, a forensic scientist with Keith Borer Consultants.
He says the new test is so much more sensitive than the earlier techniques that it can pick up fragments of DNA that may be unconnected to a crime.
For instance, testing a door handle at a house burglary using DNA 17 may increase the chance of finding the intruder's DNA, but it also increases the chance of finding the DNA of a neighbour who had popped in for a cup of tea, the policeman who responded to the 999 call, and a passer-by who had innocently transferred their DNA to the homeowner when they stood next to each other at a bus stop.
In its advice for its caseworkers and lawyers, the Crown Prosecution Service says: ""Whilst the sensitivity of DNA-17 is such as to increase the risk of DNA contamination from the handling of the samples by the Scenes of Crime Officer and the Forensic Science Provider, it also means that contamination is more easily detected.
""There is also an increased risk of detecting background DNA, which may have been deposited before and after the deposition of the target DNA.""
Duncan Woods says every week he is dealing with cases in which DNA 17 has been used to detect a profile from such a small number of cells that he can't reach a conclusion as to its significance.
""That's a pretty regular occurrence,"" he says.
DNA 17 undoubtedly has huge benefits, in providing police with intelligence that might lead them to a suspect and identifying missing people and human remains.  It's also compatible with European DNA databases.
But, together with the new retention rules, there's a sense that the landscape of DNA has changed fundamentally.
With change comes the risk of mistakes, missed opportunities and injustice, as cases work their way through the courts in the years to come.","Here's a concise summary of the article:

"The Malaysian Islamic Development Department, a religious government body, said it adopted the ruling after complaints from Muslim tourists.
Director Sirajuddin Suhaimee said the name might cause ""confusion"".
""In Islam, dogs are considered unclean and the name cannot be related to halal certification,"" he said.
Malaysian halal food guidelines say ""halal food and halal artificial flavour shall not be named or synonymously named after non-halal products such as ham, bak kut teh, bacon, beer, rum and others that might create confusion,"" local media said.
Muslim-majority Malaysia practises a moderate form of Islam but conservative attitudes are on the rise.
On Monday, popular pretzel store franchise Auntie Anne's was refused halal certification unless it renamed its ""Pretzel Dog"". Mr Suhaimee said it was ""more appropriate"" to call it a ""Pretzel Sausage"".
A representative of the US chain described it as a ""minor issue"" and said the firm was fine with changing the name on the menu.
Malaysian Tourism and Culture Minister Nazri Aziz slammed the ruling, calling it ""stupid and backward"".
""Hot dog is hot dog lah. Even in Malay it's called hot dog - it's been around for so many years. I'm a Muslim and I'm not offended,"" he told reporters, adding that there was no reason for the religious body to take offence at the word.
""It comes from the English language. Please do not make us seem stupid and backward.""
The ruling has also garnered ridicule and stirred debate among Malaysians on social media.
""It's just a name, what does it have to do with whether it's halal or not? Muslims should be more concerned with ingredients and the way food is prepared,"" wrote Eeman Yusof on Facebook.
""You can always count on the authorities to make us look stupid,"" said another Malaysian Matt Razal.
Another Facebook user said: ""Pet shops please rename your dogs as sausages.""
""It is complications like this that make our country move backwards,"" commented YL Chew.
Activist and columnist Marina Mahathir, the daughter of former Malaysian leader Mahathir Mohamad, criticised the request by the Department of Islamic Development - also known as Jakim.
""Oh we poor easily confused Muslims who have never heard of hot dogs before and who will have no choice but to buy one if one was on the menu,"" she said in a Facebook post that was shared close to 2,000 times.

"Britt Assombalonga started and finished the Reds' scoring on his first start in 18 months to help seal three points for the new French boss.
Burton had led 2-1 through Lucas Akins and Lloyd Dyer goals before Thomas Lam and Oliver Burke turned it round.
Tom Naylor's late header had Forest nerves jangling, but the hosts held on.
The only sour note for Montanier's side was the injury to goalkeeper Dorus de Vries, who was withdrawn on a stretcher in the first 20 minutes with an ankle problem.
Victory for the home side came at the expense of Forest legend Nigel Clough, who steered Albion to promotion to the second tier for the first time in their history last season.
In searing sunshine, a sell-out crowd at a reduced capacity was given a glimpse of the future with five academy talents named in the hosts' starting line-up.
Despite the loss, Burton showed character to fight back from a goal down to silence the City Ground crowd, but also to keep pressing when Forest were 4-2 up and seemingly comfortable at the end.
Nottingham Forest manager Philippe Montanier told BBC Radio Nottingham:
""Even at the end it was difficult for us because they're a very good team and we didn't manage that very well.
""But other than the end we played a good game with a young team, five academy players, it was a great victory for Nottingham Forest.
""We tried to play offensive football but it's not always easy, because the opponents are at the good level and now we need to work hard to not concede three goals because we won't score four goals every game.""
Burton Albion manager Nigel Clough told BBC Radio Derby:
""We have to learn that when we get opportunity to take a point or three form the game we have to take them and they were certainly there all the way through the game.
""The players are hugely disappointed because they know we should have got something out of the game, but there was also a bit of misfortune.
""We're resilient, we keep going and the chance we had in the 94th minute was probably the best chance of the game and we thought it was in. That sums up the day. A lot of positives, but we've got to learn and learn fast.""

"That was the thought that ran through Saskia Nelson's mind when, having spontaneously resigned from her office job at a London Olympics legacy project, she was thinking of her next move.
An amateur photographer, she decided four years ago, aged 43, that she was going to go professional.
But she hadn't really worked out how, and so she used her three-month notice period to consider her options, one of which was to join the army of wedding snappers.
""But I thought, 'I'm not married, it's not my bag, I don't really know anything about it,'"" says Saskia.
What she did know about, however, was online dating.
Having spent seven to eight years doing it, her friends considered her a connoisseur.
""I just took a very light-hearted approach to it, I saw it as a bit of an adventure, or a story to share with married friends - they love that sort of stuff,"" she says.
But one major bugbear for Saskia was the large number of bad and old - to the point of deceptive - profile photos.
""When you're over 40, ten years is a long time,"" she quips, adding that she's seen countless bad selfies and shots with an ex cropped out.
So knowing the importance of having a good profile image, she realised that there was a gap in the market to become an online dating photographer.
Saskia couldn't find anyone at all who was specialising in it, so she was effectively creating a new genre of photography when she launched her business Hey Saturday in 2013.
Explaining the name, she says: ""It's like saying hello to the most important day of the week in the dating world.""
Initially available in London, Hey Saturday has over the past four years expanded across the UK, and is now about to launch in New York.
Saskia and her team of seven photographers, all of whom are female, currently photograph up to 50 clients per month.
Saskia says that from day one she realised the photographs couldn't look too formal.
""I know that I didn't want the photos to scream 'I needed professional help',"" she says. ""So they couldn't be in a studio, or too formal - people run a mile from that.
""So I developed this ethos of [it looking like] one of your best mates happens to be passionate about photography. You are just hanging out, and taking photos.""
To create that feel, Saskia says that being outside is key. And if rain is forecast the client has the option to reschedule - particularly useful for women worried about their hair apparently.
Before the shoot they are asked to fill in a short questionnaire about themselves and the website suggests they might want to bring a couple of different tops and t-shirts (there are always nearby loos to change in).
And while Saskia found she initially had more female clients, she says it's now about 50-50, and increasingly she is getting younger people, no doubt more conscious of their online image.
She says that most clients turn up in a rush, usually with no clear ideas of how they want the photographs to look. They then pay for half an hour, one hour or 90 minutes of actual photography.
Saskia says that a large part of the job is making people feel comfortable, she says, as the clients can often feel vulnerable and a bit self-conscious.
""No-one ever comes to us saying, 'I really want to do this.' They come saying, 'this is the last thing I'll do, because I really want to meet someone,'"" says Saskia, who despite being a photographer, does not like being in front of the lens herself.
Hey Saturday has been helped by the fact that the online dating industry has exploded in recent years, fuelled by apps that people can use on their mobile phones.
There are now 10 million active online daters in the UK alone, according to industry group the Online Dating Association (ONA).
Andrew McClelland, the ONA's chief executive, says that having help with your profile, be it your photo or text description, can be helpful.
""I'm the worst person to tell someone else about me,"" he says, ""but if there's somebody who can help me sell myself then why not?
""Of course there's the risk it might be more polished than I am, but the same is true in real life.""
In the end, Mr McClelland says image counts. ""We are social animals and we get an awful lot of information from when we look at someone, although you might argue that is not always a good thing.""
Samantha Lovell found love after using Saskia's service
The 36-year-old teacher had hired a professional matchmaker who strongly advised her to get professional photos.
So visiting her sister in London she booked a shoot.
Her matchmaker showed the photos to one man, who really liked them, and Samantha arranged to meet the fellow online dater.
""We met up and hit it off immediately,"" she says.
""We were married in less than a year, and now I'm expecting a baby in the summer.""
Saskia has grown Hey Saturday by word of mouth and by following a marketing mantra known as ""know, like and trust"".
To do this, she writes blogs and articles for both news and dating websites, takes part in podcasts, and offers dating advice. The idea is that people will get to know, like and trust her, and therefore be more likely to make a booking with Hey Saturday.
As the company has expanded, Saskia says her biggest challenge has been finding photographers who she thinks fit the brand.
Saskia, speaking to me at the launch of Metier, a project profiling women and their work, says: ""It's so critical that we get people who can make people laugh, can be light-hearted and joke around, because you want to get natural, relaxed and happy shots.""
Saskia says she is also notoriously bad with numbers - describing herself as suffering from ""dyscalculia"", or being dyslexic with numbers.
Luckily she has a banker boyfriend to help with the accounts, who, you will be glad to know, she met through online dating.","Here's a concise summary of the article:

People have made the comparison with the Liberation demonstrations in 1944, and it is apt.
It is apt not just in terms of numbers, but also in how at that moment too French men and women were putting down a marker:  France is ours.
But people demonstrate also because they are afraid.
People demonstrate for causes that they feel are under threat. Demonstrating reveals our insecurity.
We demonstrate because we want the hope that comes from knowing there are others who feel as we do.
In France, national unity was the theme of Sunday's monster rally.
But by the logic of demonstrations, national unity is therefore not nearly as secure as the outpouring of mass emotion would tend to suggest.
If you want a sobering counterblast to the dominant mood, have a look at the ""Je ne suis pas Charlie"" Facebook page. It has received more than 21,000 likes in the last few days.
The mainly Muslim French people who have given a thumbs-up to the page are not supporters of violence. The vast majority have no truck with the Kouachis and Coulibaly.
But they also make clear they will not take part in a national movement that backs people who insulted the Prophet Muhammad.
Over and again they express their anger at what they see as double standards:
Why so much fuss over 17 dead when thousands have died in Gaza and Syria?
Why is it all right for Charlie Hebdo to mock Islam when the controversial comic Dieudonne M'bala M'bala is prosecuted for mocking Jews? Why is one defined as ""inciting hatred"" and not the other?
Then there are the schools in the high-immigration banlieues where the minute's silence on Thursday in memory of the Charlie Hebdo victims was interrupted by pupils or not observed at all.
France-Info - the national news radio station that normally plays down dissent in the banlieues - ran an extensive report on it, with quotes from distressed teachers.
And if you really want to be shocked, there is a ""Je suis Kouachi"" hashtag which was briefly trending on Twitter on Saturday.
All of which only goes to prove that there are many French men and women who feel their primary attachment is to Islam, not to the Enlightenment values of post-18th Century Europe.
They feel a constant sense of humiliation, and where they can, they strike back. Normally in petty acts of insubordination. But sometimes in terror.
So France is not united, and the danger is real.
But that is why demonstrations matter. People take part because they work. Seeing such vast numbers of people - of all faiths and backgrounds - united behind a single idea was indeed a moving and uplifting experience.
At the end of a horrid week, morale is back. For a time at least, we are reassured.","Here's a concise summary of the article:

The article discusses the French people's reaction to the Charlie Hebdo attack and the subsequent protests. The author notes that the urge to demonstrate is a primal instinct, reminiscent of cavemen's instinct to protect their loved ones.

The author argues that the French people are not united in their response, with some expressing anger and frustration","While the rally in Paris reflects the determination of its inhabitants to bounce back from the horror of the recent attacks, deep divisions of French society cannot be glossed over easily.",3380,544,188,8.64 seconds,1.95 MB,0.1652892561983471,0.01680672268907563,0.1487603305785124,0.8572952151298523,easy
